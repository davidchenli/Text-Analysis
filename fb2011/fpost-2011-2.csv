A night of lingerie and chocolate - 10/02/11
Sensual Chocolate Ladies Night launch party tonight at Shore - ladies get free drinks, free chocolate buffet (yum!) and there are goodie bags for the first 100 guests. Starts at 9 - see you there!
wishes all our friends and supporters a Happy Valentines Day.
is very pleased that schools in the UK have joined our 'feeding 500,000' celebrations. These pictures are from St Anne's Primary School and St Rose of Lima, whose pupils have been busy supporting Mary's Meals in lots of other ways too.
has received the first pictures from our newest project, in Quito, Ecuador, where we support a school and a shelter for homeless girls.
is constantly impressed at the creative ways people find to support Mary's Meals. Yesterday See the difference, TV presenter Sue Perkins and Anna Louise Batchelor (the porridge lady) were busy filming delicious and unusual porridge recipes. Watch this space to see the results!
CEO Magnus, is returning to Haiti this week, and will attend the opening of a new school in the Wharf Jeremie slum in Port au Prince. From next week all the children there will be receiving Mary's Meals.
enjoyed Annie Lennox's visit to Phuti school in Malawi this week. It was lovely to hear Annie singing with our volunteers and to see her get stuck in to help serve the children's porridge.
wants to thank CNN Heroes. Six months after the first film about Magnus was introduced on Larry King Live, we are still seeing the benefits - from donations to publicity and new supporters. The result: more hungry children fed.
is benefiting from fantastic support from Scottish musicians. Our friend Colin MacIntyre aka Mull Historical Society is helping Mary's Meals through his new album, and Glasgow band The Feuds are contributing through online sales of their new EP.
Can someone help me? Im in the UK and I have found a recipe online from the states for strawberry cake. It says I need strawberry gelatine. Ive never seen this in the UK? Is this the same as Strawberry jello or is this something else? Thanks xxx

I am looking for a cheeseball recipe for the week-end. I used to have a super recipe but lost the box it was in. What I remember is three different cheeses, onion, worcheshire, mayo and rolled in nuts. Any one have a great tasting recipe for one?
i recently bought your Gluten-free recipes magazine. I was unaware that you made gluteen-free products. I cook what is easy. Like the recipes. tried a couple of the gluten-free Bisquik recipes and they were quite good. also the choclate chip cheese cake got a rave review from my husband. Thanks to for thinking of those who have to be on this special diet
is bisquick the same as buttermilk biscuit mix? regular bisquick doesn't list buttermilk as an ingredient
What is kirsh? I saw it in a black forest cake recipe and was wondering what it was.
So sorry to have downed anyone's day ... just wanted to share my feelings . Love 99 % of your recipes here, and have been cooking personally & professionally for 36 + years. I love to try new food (why else would God bless us with such versatile taste buds?) but didn't like the fish taco thing. Sorry to have been a pain in the tail. Keep the recipes coming - everyone has different tastes, that is why there are so many options out there!
My favorite thing to do with a Betty Crocker cake mix is make an easy cobbler! Use a glass 9 x 9 pan. Dump 1 can of pie filling (your choice of flavors, I've even mixed 1/2 and 1/2. Dump 1 Betty Crocker white or yellow cake mix on top. Space out 9 spoonfuls of butter across the top. Bake at 350 until brown and bubbly. YUM! One of hubs favorites!
just though I would share that I am NOT happy to find out that you have downsized the brownie mixes!
My Royal Blue Velvet cake! Yumm-o!!!
Hey Betty Crocker! Me and My Family had 2000 Betty Crocker Batters on my House! You'll believe!!! Mom always makes us cake and pastries!

I love your gluten-free chocolate chip cookies! But I was dismayed to find out that your products likely have GMOs. Can you confirm this? And if so, will you have products in the future that do not contain genetically modified ingredients? There are many of us who do NOT want them! Thanks for considering.
My new creation... box of betty crocker cinnamon swirl cake mix with 16 oz apple sauce. Swirl the cinnamon. Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes. Drizzle with cream cheese frosting while hot. YUM. No eggs, no oil, no water. JUST applesauce. You can do the same with 16 oz pumkin. Yum as well!

Thank you so much for making amazing cake mix that I used for my son's first birthday party. Would not use anything else. <3
Just wanted to let you know the last two or three times I used your products, the dough has come out very sticky and loose. I'm tired of having to "fix" this problem, as with using your directions, this SHOULD NOT happen. It's pretty much ruined my baking experiences with my daughter when your products have been used. I'll never make this mistake again. Thanks for a crappy time...My daughter now calls you "Betty Crapper". LOL!!
Monkey cupcakes for my son's 1st birthday! :)
I love my Betty Crocker cook book from 1978 that I bought at a garage sale! It is priceless! And the recipes are wonderful classics!

How do I get the recipe for the pastel-colored whoopie pies on the first page?? 
I made the Royal Blue Velvet cake yesterday, and it turned out wonderful! We had such a good time eating the left over frosting and the trimmings from the cake (the cake was in the fridge letting the frosting set a bit). I would definitely recommend this cake to all. It was great!
Got a big party coming up and lots of treats to prepare. How soon ahead of time can whoopie pies be made and remain good?!?!
I've been patiently waiting for almost 8 weeks! I still don't have my new calendar :(
Cake I made for my Grandson's 5th Birthday...2010
I still have my mother's Betty Crocker cookbook from the early 60s. I think it was from 1963. I had to get a new one about 3 years ago because some of pages in the old book were beginning to fade from all the years of heavy use. Not too much though because I still go back to it from time to time.
Does anyone remember the sugared eggs that parents used to make at Easter. U couldn't eat them they were just to look at. I think they used the egg from leggs pantyhose. Is anyone has that recipe please post.

Do you have a recipe for Marshmallo Creme Fudge?? My Mom used to make it but I don't have a recipe...
I inherited a cookbook from my mother, it was a little bigger than a paperback and not very thick. I can never remember her ever buying a cookbook so it must have been old. There was a recipe for a peach cobbler I'd love to have again in it. I lost it in a fire in 03. Called for fresh or canned peacher, flour, sugar and spices. 2003 was a long time ago so there was probably other ingredients. You just mixed the batter, poured into a 9x13 pan and put the peaches on top. The batter cooked thru the peaches and made a doughy crust on top. Anybody have a recipe similiar to that I can get?
I'm looking for cake ideas for my SON will be turning 16

Okay I have been on the Betty Crocker e-mail list for a number of years, but when I try to log on it will not accept me. Verizon was taken over by Frontier.com and it keeps saying my e-mail is already on record, but will not accept my password. I have not been receiving e-mails as Frontier stopped forwarding e-mails as of January 1, 2011. Please change my e-mail to dah.weirs@frontier.com so I can get your mailings again.
I saw an ad for this page in the little ad sidebar section on Facebook and the picture was of what looked like pretty multi-colored cake sandwiches. Pink, blue, green, orange, purple cake-like pieces with matching colored frosting (I assume) in between. Where can I can that recipe?!

I made these cupcakes tonight taking inspiration from the 2011 Betty Crocker Calendar .... These are a "Close" Replica to February's Picture!

So overall I think I did a pretty good job!

Chef te olvidaste :( la persona con la que me interesaria contactarte esta creando una asociacion para alergicos, no creas que esto no es en serio , ambas tenemos hijos alergicos y por eso la insistencia de que se de a conocer el tema y que puedas apoyarnos con algunas recetas, sino es posible un programa completo talvez con las capsulas que realizan o puedas pasar de vez en cuando algun platillo o postre que no contenga alguno de los ingredientes que son mas comunes entre los alergicos 
en N.L. tambin tenemos el mejor oregano!!!!!

My 30 Fair-trade hamper I put together at Petrol-Guisborough raising money for Mencap. 1 a go! Drawn 13 March, only 9 more chances to play!
Passion for Wales!
At our local Co Op at Immingham the staff always look fed up and depressed, also dont tend to offer help with packing etc. When I go into Morrison or Tesco the staff there are always smiling and offer to help. My wife is deaf/blind so she is the one who suffers the most. I think the problem lies with the staff having been there a long time as used to be Kwik Save, then Sommerfield and now Co Op
need more pink and chili peppers on the store radio :0)
Why have you removed the more "healthy choice" foodstuffs , along with the less "ecological damaging" products from your shelves, especially in the newly refurbished, Superstore on the High Street, Erdington, Birmingham?
I Hate Danny Pike with a passion, Co-op radio is shite!
Can co op radio give massive props to the cheshunt massive cos theyre off the meat rack!! 
rhubarb lovely stuff
My local store (Studley) has decimated its beers department. 2 islands have been reduced to 1, displaying a "choice" of ONE bottled cider (Bulmers), a handful of bottled ales, lots of tinned rubbish, and 3 flatscreen tellies - absolutely daft. What are you playing at?
Hey Coop, was listening to the wonderful sounds of Danny Pike today at work. He claimed we could make requests. So now, I'm here! I would love to here In Too Deep, off the Band Sum 41. Also, I'm an online and hospital radio presenter, who shall I contact to ask nicely if I can present a one off show on COOPRATIVEEE RADIOOOO. From Chris off the Thrapston Store :D 
Not feeling too well today, might have to stay off work tomorrow, sorry.
My local Somerfield store and local somerfield petrol station were recently taken over by the coop,The local post office was already run by the coop,and products were allways 2-3 pence more expensive at the post office coop, the somerfield Store and the Petrol Station are now more expensive than elsewhere. I now travel 3 miles down the road to shop,I know it costs a few pennies more to get there,BUT HEY, I DONT PAY THE COOPS INFLATED PRICES, THEY ARE JUST A RIP_OFF
would you play bowling for soup or biffy clyro :D
I would like to know when we will get some instore advertising at our store instead of music playing all day...the choice of music isnt the best for our customers and to at least make them aware of what products we have on offer would be more beneficial...we are a lovely market town supermarket in Brecon...your thoughts would be much appreciated!!
Could you please play any track by gary moore or thin lizzy in mark of gary's sad passing this week.. tomorrow night (Saturday 12th) anytime after 6pm from long street Easingwold branch..thanks 
think you should play all up todate songs on the co operative radio so we can sing along to the songs we have boring music on at the minute 
When does the Strand branch open? Somewhere to spend my vouchers!
Could you please give a big shout out to Karen Reed at Embankment Road, Plymouth. Telling her she's worth more than any flowers or boxes of chocs, between 630am & 3pm tomorrow :) Many thanks 
please, stop playing the same song over and over and bloody over again on the radio... play more diverse music rather than just charty crap... from ian at the co-op in stepps, glasgow
Friday nights - usually a very very good night on Radio One, yet you still insist on playing pre-historic chart-crap. Please sort out your DJ's sense of music for atleast the weekend playlists on Co-op Radio, as a worker.. I can honestly say it's driving the public MAD. The workers are already zombified by it and go to sleep singing some 70's motown. There is a time and a place for it, Danny Pyke.
in the early eightys , i worked at the regional distribution center in halesowen west midlands......any body know me .... ( linda cameron )
How's everyone's Saturday's going? Are you doing those important things in life?
Just got a nice bottle of wine from our local co op mmm
roast,red wine,apple crumble - diet starts on monday
Thankgod christmas is over again. I couldn't possibly have survived listening to that auful Gabriella Climi song anymore, seriously a million times on an 8 hour shift, TWO YEARS on the trot is a tad excessive...
Helloooo, could you please play Stalemate by Ben's Brother and Anastacia on Co-op Radio pleeeeeeeease! :D
We now have a store in every UK postal area with the launch of our new Store at the Strand! No other UK retailer is at the heart of so many of your communities!
any store in HR2 other than Bobblestock? Or NP15?
Big shout out for the Guys and gals at Co-op Middleport Stoke !!
Mum nipped to our local coop, bought some fresh cooked chicken and crossiants for lunch, cookies and coffee for afters, coop helps you love your mum more lol.
For those of you having a Roast dinner today, are you having Beef, Chicken or Pork? Or something entirely different?
we are having beef today

It is good to see various organizations beginning to recognize perhaps the biggest future challenge facing humanity. I believe the predicition are dire if consumers and food chain do not embrace the need for modern production practices that are safe, produce nutritious, affordable food in a sustainable manner. Sustainable is maximizing productivity per acre and per head!

Artwork by friend Eeshaun Soh at the new and popular Artease Cafe located at Tanjong Pagar. More bubble tea!
Papparich Samplers - 3 local dishes for $12.50. Can be shared. I will recommend the curry laksa, prawn mee, dry koay teow, char koay teow, chicken rice... almost everything lah!
A standard Bubble Tea with milk and pearls contains roughly 510 calories. That's jogging for at least 90 minutes!
This caf is likely to bring you fond memories of Peanuts and Snoopy. However, the unadorned food ironically makes you feel that you are eating a kids meal. 
Kidney mee sua at Kaki Bukit was covered with a dark, thick soup which emitted a herbal aroma. When scooped up, there were generous portions of neatly cut up pieces of pork kidney and lean pork slices. 
The chilli crab pizza at Singapore Sling Boutique had a suitably thin crust, with juice spurting out of the soft shell crab, sending warm succulent sauce lingering all over my taste buds. Oh L L! Rachel Judith Ang

Comfort food. Key lime cheese cake with ginger snap crust with grated dark chocolate. You can leave off the strawberries but do not steal my starfruit.
Going local became a lot easier when the farmer markets started carrying local olive oil. BTW, I became a food felon, a friend gave me milk from their cow and I bought a couple of rabbits from someone else who had killed them. I am sitting here waiting for the Feds to arrest me :-)
Anyone in Texas who like the idea of cottage industry being relatively free of rules written for and by big companies, get in touch by letter, email and phone with your state representative and let them know our support. It will make a huge difference to you local farmer markets.
Rabbit felonious. Everything on the plate was from the markets except the potatoes which were just organic. I saw some potatoes at the Tuesday market, but they were going from one vendor to another as seed, without a Monsanto or Dupont intermediary step.
Comfort food! All home made and farmer market ingredients except the cranberries and almonds. Next time I can use locally grown pecans.
A new (to me) pork vendor in the Saturday morning Eastside St. market in Houston. These were superb Polish style, but much tastier with lower fat and not quite so strongly spiced as the normal and the verdict at the table was unanimous empty plates. I had some boneless country style pork with mushroom, onion, Dijon mustard sauce and local, all natural broccoli from the them the other day too.
If you ever want another reason why Monsanto share cropping is not the ideal model, just read the summary of this work.
All local food. We are lucky in this part of Texas, but you can find a winter diet at the farmer markets. In past times the turnips, potatoes and carrots would have been in a root cellar and good cauliflower will suffer a few feet of snow.
All the veggies from the local farmers. The carrots from the farms around Houston are without a doubt, the best tasting I have had for years. This cold snap will also give us another peach season like last year.

The research parameters certainly aren't 'tight' in terms of causality, but any doctor worth a damn will tell you that drinking sodas PERIOD isn't a good idea, especially aspartame laden diet sodas. This study demonstrates PATTERNS of behavior associated with illness, consumption of diet sodas being just one of many unhealthy practices that go hand-in-hand to produce an increase in cardiovascular disease and stroke.

As a loyal GMC driver/ buyer I am stating as of today I will no longer purchase or recommend in any way any vehicle manufactured by GM. I own a GMC Yukon that when purchased was GMC certified and only had 30000 miles on it. I have had the vehicle less than a year and when I got in it a few weeks ago there was a crack in my dash by the airbag. After several attempts of getting ahold of my so called customer service agent (Samantha) I was told that after spending 33000 dollars and having all services done at my dealership that I am out of luck and have to fix this myself..we also purchased a new Malibu LTZ 2 years ago and as far as the truck for our son well Ford here we come. Thank you GM for nothing
All of us need to remember something. The American car companies are the back bone of this country and our economy. They have given us a better life style and great jobs for the last 100+ years. We need to remember that and we need to give them our support now when they need it. We need to help ourselves first before we can help others, for if we are not strong, helping others make us weaker. Buy a Truly American Car.

Thank you for now making GF whole grain oat flour. While I am only gluten intolerant, I've never had an "gluten attack" from eating any of your non-wheat products. That goes to show how good of a manufacturer you are, and how good your practices are. We pretty much only buy the GF products, but you know there are still a few non-GF items we buy too. 
i run through so much bob's certified gluten-free oatmeal, i just don't know where i'd be without it!

Why are you selling certificates where the restaurant already closed their doors???
What happends when you have purchased several gift certs for one resturant but they are no longer accepting them? There is no expiration date on them either.
Please answer to me. I just bought 2 gift cards. it says one restaurant is "Minimum purchase of $40" and the other restaurant is "Minimum purchase of $45". when i was about to print the gift cards,both said "The following terms and conditions apply to the certificate that you are about to view and/or print:Minimum purchase of $100. " Why is that???? This is my first time of useing restaurant.com. I feel like i got ripped off....
any discount code today..."treat" no longer works 
 The following is just ONE of the restaurants listed on rest.com thta NO :ONGER accept these certificates!! But this reataurant is still listed and you can still purchase these. WHAT A SCAM!!!!!!!!! Avanti Gourmet 711 East Main St Hendersonville, TN 37075 (615) 264-4505

instead of just doing dinner with the certificates you should look into breakfast and lunch as well.
You are still selling coupons for a couple of restaurants in Redwood City, CA that are CLOSED: Flaming Fresco and Red Lantern. I bought these as stocking stuffers when they were still open, and got burned - but you should take them off your site!
This website is awesome! My b/f just spent $18 on 6 restaurants valued at $25 each! Can't wait to use them :-)
Last night we went to The Lotus Garden in Utica, NY. They had a sign up that they no longer accept Restaurant.com certificates. We had just bought the certificates (2) a couple days ago. They told us they've been trying to get their listing off your site since September 2010 - at first they were told it would be a month, then they were told it would take three months. I see they are still listed there... So, we have two certificates we cannot use - how do we get a refund from you for this purchase?
Great site...FREE Point of Sale for restaurant owners
This is a horrible scheme to make restaurants go bankrupt. They pull restaurants in without explaining all the different options you can have, and when you ask to change your requirements (such as no alcoholic beverages included within the set price) none of the representatives will help you. In addition it is false to claim your coupons are gift certificates because that implies we are receiving some of the money people pay for the coupons. If you value your local restaurant do not support this company. Thank you. 
This is a scam!!! I just purchased 2 gift certificates on 1/31/11 and I just tried to use 1 of them today. The restaurant just told me they no longer accept gift certificates from Restaurant.com. So it looks like I am out the money I spent on these gift certificates on your website!

Try them out. I just got a great Valetine deal from them. It is free to sign up.
I just happened to catch the r.c ad during the football game last night. The one where one can get $30 worth of Tibetan curry for $15. What a tasteless, offensive, pathetic, ignorant display that was. It was a perfect statement of how stupid and crass people can be. The good news is that Karma is real and you just might get to be reborn in Tibet - find out for yourselves just how cute their reality is.....

i bought $100 gift card today with the promotion of 80% off and i just paid 8 dollars, that was amazing but, this is my first time, what are the restrictions with this gift card when you go to the restaurant???
I just used this for the first time and I am a little more than disappointed. I figured I am buying a gift certificate and not a coupon. If I purchase a gift certificate, it is the same as cash and I should be able to use it like cash. I am going to a restaurant for my birthday and I purchased three GC's to cover the cost of the meal just to find out when I printed them that I can only use ONE at a time. I will never use Restaurant.com again. It just is NOT worth the hassle to save $7.50 on my meal of $50 or more. Give me a break!
I just bought 2 GC for a Baltimore restaurant and they were declined by the resraurant the same day!! I just wasted a little money!

I don't understand why, when I use a promotional code from an email that states - "Get $25 gift certificates for $2" and I wind up being charge $3.50 for a $25 gift certificate. What gives????
RESTAURANT.COM IS PRACTICING DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING. I discovered a promotional offer for Eagle's Nest, a highly rated restaurant at the top of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Indianapolis, and the ONLY special instructions at the front page of the offer are: "Minimum 2 entrees. Valid Sun-Thur. 20% Gratuity added prior to discount." Then, AFTER I purchased the certificate, I discovered, written on the certificate itself, "Minimum purchase of $100"!!! Can you believe that? I can never trust restaurant.com again, because I will never know for sure how many "special instructions" there really are attached to a discount certificate!!!
This is an awesome deal. I just got back from miami and I know there were a ton of people from our company that took advantage of these great deals when they traveled and can take advantage of the great deals near home too. Share this site with others especially with valentines day around the corner why not save money and got out to a nice restaurant:)

Port Cafe of Naugatuck 147 Rubber Ave. Naugatuck, CT 06770 I went there on 1-11-2011 it was the dirtiest restaurant I think I have been in. We all walked out. We never ordered so we don't know how the food taste, I really dont care they have to clean it up first. 
Hi i would like to know, P.F Chang's Restaurant is in your list?? i searched for it i didn't find it,just i want confirmation :)
You should WARN your customers/make it easier to identify the DIFFERENCE between gift cards and egift cards...(really gift certificates you print out) they look ALIKE on the SITE and may choose the WRONG one...and MISS OUT on offers..poor customer service...then restaraunt.com just says... "too bad".. 
I have a question... I normally have good experiences with my restaurant.com restaurants, but we went to one that was JUST HORRIBLE. Tried to talk to the owner/chef, and he was just nuts.... yelling at me and telling me there was nothing wrong with his food, and that I didn't know anything because I had never been to Italy. We witnessed 3 other people sending back the same meal. We ended up getting stuck paying for a meal that we didn't even get to eat! Just nuts. Not sure if they redeemed our coupon or not, but wondering if there's a way to get that refunded and/also would recommend not having them on your list of available restaurants. ???
My boyfriend got a gift card last night for v day, forgot to enter the promo code. But it was not a big deal we called and 10 mins later it was credited back to his card and we were able to make or reservation! Thanks for being helpful!

Hey, Everyone, this is a great website--check it out whatever your zip code. Sadly, Manhattanites, the best deals for Hill Country are already spoken for, but a friend and I scored a great lunch last Friday for $8 apiece. 
Just an FYI, The Cedars restaurant in Pasadena CA has closed. Plywood on the windows and a for sale sign up. I'm shopping your site now, and they're still listed.
please boycott restaurant.com. terrible company. they sign you up under false pretenses, promise you things that never happen, take your money, won't let you leave their company when you try for months, and not just have bad customer service, but are vindictive and mean. please don't support them, and pass on the information.
Hey everyone, it's Cary Chessick here! We can all relate to embarrassing restaurant moments like spilling a drink across the table. What is the most embarrassing thing that has happened to you at a restaurant?
I am not real happy with my most recent Restaurant experience, first off your website say hours were Wens: 11:00 AM - 11:00 PM when we got there they said they were closed and it was only 8:30, which was soon told they closed normally at 9pm not 11pm like your site said. We were served but the prices were off by $3-$5 on each entre, we were however upto $27 on food and well over $35 as stated but was told i must spend $35 on non-food to qualify to use it. Funny thing is I have used 3 of these before and one at the same place just in another city and never was told that alcohol is excluded.I know we can not include alcohol in the first $25. I am so upset we had to pay $50 out of pocket cause of this. I would not have went here or spent that money if I knew this was gonna be the case.

I'm very upset....I bought a certificate on this website, expecting to save money, and I actually had to spend more...The restaurant did not validate my coupon, therefore I had to pay for the full dinner.

We love Restaurant.com!! Suggestion for your website~ In "My Account" show used coupons with the date. Because of the one per month limit...would make it easier to track when the last time a coupon for a particular restaurant was used. 
How often does restaurant.com review the status of restaurants participating in their program? I have recently bought two certificates only to find out the restaurants were closed, as in closed down permanently. I'm thinking I ought to be calling the restaurant to verify it is still in operation before I purchase the certificate.

Looking for a marinaded crab claw recipe. Anyone have one? 
Does anyone have a recipe for Mary Mahonney's Lobster Georgo? I have read interviews with the chef and he gives a "description" more or less. I have tried to duplicate with little satisfaction. I think it would be delicious with crab/shrimp sans the lobster shell for serving.
Muscadine or Scuppernong Jelly 2 quarts Muscadines or Scuppernongs 6 cups sugar Seperate pulp from the skins of grapes. Cook skins about 20 mins with about 1/2 cup of water. Cook pulp until soft. Press through a strainer to remove seeds and skins. Combine pulp, and sugar and bring to a boil stirring frequently. Cook to gelling point stirring often. Remove from heat. Ladle hot jam into hot jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Process 15 mins in boiling water canner. 
Anyone have a recipe they'd like to post for gallets/gallettes? It's made with flour; sort of a flat dough that's fried. Several people have asked for recipes for them.

If you missed these burrito-shells last week, give them a look. Cheesy, meaty, spicy awesomeness!
If you can smell apples in the air while driving through Grabouw, Ceres and the Langkloof it is probably the Golden Delicious, Royal Gala, Royal Beaut, Starking and Top Reds that are being harvested.
Tune in to CNN's Marketplace Africa at these times in South Africa to see Tru-Cape Fruit Marketing featured. Times are subject to change. Friday 18th February at 21h45, Saturday 19 February at 03h45, and then again at 08h15 and on Sunday, February 20th at 09h15.
Just heard from CNN that they have changed the broadcast date of Market Place Africa that features Tru-Cape to March 11. I will advise new broadcast times.
On Saturday we drove from Paarl to Pringle Bay via Grabouw. It is so amazing to see the trees laden with fruit ready for picking. The mountain pass between Franschhoek and Villiersdorp is especially beautiful.
CNN's Marketplace Africa is featuring Tru-Cape in their programme on the SA fruit industry. Tommorow they're filming links at The Johannesburg Market. Will let you know when it is due for broadcast.
Peel, core and slice at the table Tru-Cape Fruit Marketing is proud to announce a table-top apple peeler, slicer and corer. Enthrall the whole family with a few easy turns of the handle! Please comment with your email address if you'd like purchasing details. See www.tru-cape.co.za

Hi All---how long does the Happy Girl ketchup last in the refrigerator?
The food preservationists offering us up on our website at http://happygirlkitchen.com/fp-cart/ until Tuesday at 2 pm. This week we highlighted Live Earth Farm and their CSA www.liveearthfarm.net and a PICKLE PACKING PARTY box exclusively from their fields. ENJOY!
I got the pickling box and the instructions state a 22 minute processing time for the packed pints. Any idea what temperature? Boiling, 200 degrees, over 180 degrees? 22 minutes at boiling seems like a long time even for radishes let alone fennel. 
FREE COFFEE! If you are in the neighborhood in the next 2 hours we are practicing espresso drinks. Come on by and test it out.
Raul getting his jelly fish cappuccino. It is a design we are working on for our Monterey Bay Aquarium friends!

TEAM HOT DOG takes the trophy home! Team Lunchmeat put up a good fight, but you all showed way more love (a.k.a. votes) for the creative dishes our HOT DOGGERS came up with. Practice makes perfect, Lunchmeaters. I suggest hitting the stove, table or picnic blanket hard this year and Im sure youll come back stronger than ever.

Anthony.....How do I find out if you received my email with my mailing address for the little piggy to be sent to my son??? Im sure you are extremely busy and may not have a chance to reply but I just wanna make sure you got it cuz my son is super excited!!!
Hey! I know many are bummed w/ the S.B. results & that truly bums me out because we only did it to create some fun & get you some prizes! I assure you there was no cheating. But, next time we'll do the judging process since that's what many asked for! How's that? Now leave me alone! j/k Don't leave me. I DEMAND YOU TO STAY! j/k Just hang out or something. See, now I'm all insecure! :) //Anthony
We bought some on-sale Bar-S Deli Shaved lunchmeat today, some Bar-S corn dogs the other day...We've got Bar-S gallore, in case another blizzard hits! ;) Hey, is there anything we can do with our leftover points from that contest? It's okay, if not.
I, Anthony, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth I also swear to make legal mumbo jumbo more clear in future games. Honestly, I just feel bad it was confusing. I was more concerned with making sure people were having a good time than double checking the small boring print. That said, come back next week and check out how we'll follow our own rules this time around //Anthony
My piggy and I are celebrating with some top shelf alcohol tonight...piggy is tying one on woohoo!! I am celebrating the fact that I bought new living room furniture for the first time in my life and the fact that my husband didn't object, yipee!! Piggy is a lush and is just along for the ride... Anthony tell piggy he can't do belly shots off every chick in the bar!!
I have a real piggy, Mayham, she is one of the sweetest animals & has the greatest personality, if i could potty train her to go outside i would bring her home. Oh i forgot to say she is 400 lbs
Hey Bar S... will you define the verbiage on your coupons for all to see? Please tell the difference between "Limit One Coupon Per Purchase" and "Limit One Coupon Per Transaction". I already know... I would just like to point a cashier and manager to this information. :) Thanks!
How can I get a coupon for some yummy bacon?? My puppy gets jealous when I cook it! So I have to share it with her!
Mmmm I just had some mac n cheese with some of your turkey jumbo franks that I got for .20$ Bar S rocks!
I had to bring in reinforcements because I'm struggling between 2 recipes. The winner will be announced today so hang tight!

I missed the contest but this page is making me hungry. I love my hot dogs cut in half, fried in a cast iron skillet, a bit of cheddar cheese melted on top. Then you eat it on toasted whole wheat with fresh tomato slices, onions & Miracle Whip. Add just a bit of horse radish and your all set. 
Wow! I am just getting hip!

The big game day is here everyone! Let's do another FILL IN THE BLANK! During the big game, I'll be chowing down on _________________.
It was 75 degrees and sunny in Phoenix today so I went and bought a bunch of our hot dogs to grill up. On my way home and my tire blew so I'm currently sitting on the side of the freeway waiting for the tow truck to get here with a car full of hot dog ingredients. I'm thinking about popping the hood and grilling the dogs on the engine. Bummer Saturday night so far!
This little piggie went to market just ahead of the storm with his reusable shopping bag. Appreciative of the great selection of super delicious Bar-S offerings at his local store, he wanted to purchase it all. I had to put my foot down. "We arn't going whole hog today buddy" I told him. But he hoofed it down the aisle to the checkout. With a wink, he whipped out a gift certificate and said "Breakfast and lunch are on me."
Taken from another Facebook buddy of mine, "Tuesday...you are Monday's slightly better looking twin sister." How did Valentines Day go? If it didn't go, how did S.A.D. (Single Awareness Day) go? :) //Anthony
Since I failed at choosing fans of the week last week I ponied up and doubled down! This weeks FANS OF THE WEEK are KAYLA PAYNE EVANS, HOLLY WRIGHT-WEDDLE, GLENN ODAGAWA and CASEY BARRETT! Please shoot your mailing address to barsfoods.anthony@gmail.com so I can send you some free Bar-S product JUST for being a fan! //Anthony

What was your favorite commercial from the big game last night? Mine? Hands down, the Volkswagen spot. Fun, STAR WARS! pulled at the heart strings. Good stuff. //Anthony http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R55e-uHQna0
Apple and Dominos must be doing great financially this year because they're giving away a TON of free Mac book airs and pizza for free on the Bar-S facebook page! :) //Anthony note the sarcasm.
GO PACK GO!!.... My Bar-S Piggie showing his team spirit!
Do you guys remember the "Peanut Butter Jelly Time" song? Well! How about PEANUT BUTTER RAFFLE TIME! Where you at? Now, here you go! Kinda sad, this is the last one for the Snack Bowl... The winners are... in the comments below!
Can you guys help me out? I got a notification that there is some spam about a "freebie" on our wall and when I check on my phone I see it, but not when I get on the computer to check. In an effort to keep our hangout "spam free" please click "like" if you see it too so I can make sure I'm not the one going nuts. Thanks!
Anthony. I received my Nerf Football yesterday just as promised. Thank you for all that you do :)

Was just reading through the recipes and then clicked stumble got booted out of it and now im getting a facebook error message curious if something is wrong with your site??
Bars S is my first choice in meat above all others.. I used to work in a grocery store and one of the customers used to go to the plants where the meat was processed and fix the machinery when it broke down...He told me out of all the plants that he visits...Bars S has the cleanest plant far and beyond some of the other plants...ever since then..i buy this product first...just thought i would share.....
Hope to win the madden game.

This incredible cookie recipe was sent over to me by Sherri Jones Adams (thanks, Sherri!) and I just love toppin' them off with my Cinnamon Essence - a mixture of coarse sugar and chopped cinnamon pieces.

Has the market looked into the possibility of accepting food stamps? I think it might increase sales and be a good way to get good food into the hands of needy families. 
I would love to see some sort of designation (signage, area, etc) for vendors that sell only organic produce/products. It certainly would influence my decision on where I buy my stuff! I don't just want to buy local, I want to buy healthy!! :)
We will have 3 vendors setting up tomorrow! Thats pretty good for this time of year! We will have Eggs, Tomatoes, and Turnips. Everything at our market is local and grown by the ones selling it. Enjoy this nice weather!

I am guest posting on the super sweet blog, Buns In My Oven. I made cupcakes. They are good. 
Thank you sooo much to Where Women Cook for linking to my Angry Bird Cupcakes today!! :)
Angry Birds cupcakes. You knew I was gonna go there, didn't you?
I made soup. Wanna party?
Rango cupcakes. I don't want to talk about it.
German Chocolate muffins (further evidence that I am a nonviolent and kind person)
Rango Cupcakes. (Johnny Depp is gonna find me...I just know it)
You know you have a Twitter problem when you think in hashtags...my husband just asked me if I wanted to grill for dinner on Thursday. My first thought? #dontyouwatchtheweather #youhaveseriousissues #refusetofreezemybuttoff
LOVING this photo from my friend Kristen at Dine & Dish...looks a lot like my floor!! But instead of pistachio shells, it's cereal and M&M's.
Now is the part of the day where I sort through my son's Valentines, looking for evidence of a secret girlfriend. "You're A Cool Cat, Valentine"....."Sweet Valentine Wishes"...holy cow these girls want to marry my kid. It's so obvious. I mean, you don't say that to just anyone, right???
Cap'n Crunch Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Marshmallow Frosting!! (fat free and zero calories!! ) (okay that was a total lie)
Okay, so my husband asked me why Lindsey Lohan was in so much trouble for stealing from movies from Netflix. I told it was a NECKLACE, but in hindsight, it would have been a lot more fun to go along with the Netflix thing.
My Angry Birds Cupcakes are on BlogHer today!! I would love you to go check them out if you haven't already. 
Oatmeal Spice Cookies and how I'm using my calorie counting app to judge people.
Outside, the snow is gently falling, I'm cozied up in comfy pj's and wool socks holding a cup of hot cocoa, and CALL OF DUTY: BLACK OPS IS BLARING IN THE BACKGROUND. Sigh. This is soooo not like in the movies.
Loved this picture and thought I'd share as a preview to tomorrow night's post...hope you're enjoying your Saturday!! xoxo
I'm trying to talk my BFF into leaving her job to come help me clean my house. I have promised a lunch of a tuna fish sandwich with salt and vinegar chips, unlimited Choco Tacos and Everlasting Gobstoppers, control of my iPod, AND she can use my Swiffer SweeperVac, which is super duper fun. She still says NO. :(
If any of you are "tierd of being passed over for the busines opportunity because you don't have a degree", I have 38 emails in my junk folder that I can forward to you. Just trying to be a good friend.
In an exciting turn of Snow Day events, my husband brought me home a big bottle of cheap white wine. The question is, what time is it acceptable to start drinking it?
While cleaning up the living room, I found 3 Laffy Taffy on the coffee table. Thinking they were a reward for all my hard work, I ate them. After a long lecture from my 6 year old, it is abundantly clear that they were not a reward meant for me. Sigh....
Yesterday, I bought a bottle of S. Pellegrino water at Walmart. I just wanted to see what it felt like to be fancy. I still haven't drank any because I'm pretty sure I have to be out of my pajama pants/wearing lots of jewelry. Anyone else wanna buy a bottle and have a virtual fancy water party online? (say yes say yes say yes)
Just finished this book...good, but the ending was very rushed. I need something good to read...any suggestions?
Saw these Flamin' Hot Cheetos PUFFS (instead of the usual crunchy) when I was grocery shopping. I took the liberty of buying a bag so I could let you know if they are good or not. They are. 
My son just saw me on the laptop and said, "mom...I see you're busy working". How awesome is that? Now if he can just convince my husband.....
I was so surprised and flattered to be featured on Rachel's sweet blog, A Southern Fairytale today!! Thanks so much, chickie...you made my day!!
One of my friends, Sugarcrafter is on Facebook now!! Head over and "like" her page!!
Dear Christina Aguilera: Please. Stop. Screaming. I never thought I'd say this, but I really miss Genie In a Bottle. You were so much gentler then.
So excited that Mom It Forward has named me the mom of the day!! Obviously, consuming mass quantities of Fruit Roll Ups and occasionally overusing glittery make- up did not take me out of the running. THANK YOU!!!! :)
DYING over this post from Dine & Dish. Donuts are my all time FAVORITE food!!
Dear Skechers: Bobs are not TOMS. They are Bobs. I do not want Bobs. You are a big fat copycatter and I do not like it a bit. 
Finally uploading photos from Blissdom and found this one of me, Bridget from Bake at 350, Amy from She Wears Many Hats, and Cheryl from TidyMom. They were such fun to be around, and even helped me find my shoes late one night after I had several cocktails. They only made fun of me a little bit. And they are STILL only making fun of me a little bit.
I won a fun Nestle Toll House kit at Blissdom and I get to give one to a reader too!! To enter to win, tell me how many Conversation Hearts are in this vase. I will take guesses for 30 minutes, and whoever is the closest will win!!
I need some easy and low fat recipes for lunch (like when I'm home alone during the day and become weak to temptation)...got any?
Does anyone watch Dr. Phil? Alex from the Dr. Phil Family needs a good spanking.
Learned a new word today that totally devastated me. DIPE which stands for Documented Instance of Public Eating. You know all those times celebrities are photographed eating junkfood? It's a publicity trick to make us think they are normal. Really, they survive on celery. I feel so betrayed.
So...I made up a word last night while watching Wednesday's American Idol. It's miva, meaning a male diva. Feel free to use it anytime.
I just got an email from someone named Wong Tang wanting to give me money from an account in Iraq. Do you think he's related to Long Duck Dong? And if so, do you think he will introduce me to Jake Ryan? Just wondering.
Every time I watch Casino, I find myself wishing three things: #1 That Robert De Niro will realize that orange is NOT his color #2 Sharon Stone will realize that Joe Pesci is skeevy #3 that Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci will realize that NO ONE lies to Robert De Niro.
Don't be a Valentine's Grinch, okay? Seriously, you're making Cupid cry.
Someone came and knocked on my front door unannounced and my son ran back to my room yelling "I'm too young to die!!!"....perhaps we are too sheltered?
I think I'm just going to have leftover Conversation Hearts for dinner. They're low in calories, and they each have an uplifting little message for me to read.
If you see a huge cloud of smoke coming from the direction of Arkansas, pay it no mind. It's just me burning my giant pile of dirty laundry.
Every time I accidentally type in a CAPTCHA code wrong, I immediately start second guessing myself. Am I a real human? Am I a spammy robot? Dang you CAPTCHA users for putting me through such mental anguish.
Captain Crunch Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Marshmallow Frosting, and how to NOT be weird.
Dear Real Housewives of Miami: I wanted our relationship to work. I really did. But.....I just don't see it happening. Something is missing. Sorry.
My husband is majorly addicted to Breath Savers mints, which he says are so awesome because they are 0 calories, so they don't affect his diet. I just looked at the back of the package. They are 5 calories each. Is it wrong that I felt gleeful when I called to tell him he was WRONG? I'm such a bad person.
Cap'n Crunch Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Marshmallow Frosting
It should be a law that everything closes when it rains, and we all have to sit and home and eat soup cuddled up under a blanket. That's my vote, anyways.
I've got enchiladas bubbling in the oven, Mexican rice frying on the stove and big ol' pot of pinto beans...what are you having for dinner? (p.s. I worked very hard on it) (p.p.s. as a reward, I am having a Choco Taco later even though the Bachelor isn't on)
If you're looking for a way to lower the fat in a few of your favorite foods, I can't recommend this book enough. We had the spicy breaded chicken sandwiches for dinner (300 calories) and they were SO GOOD!!! I hate diet books. But I like THIS diet book.
I have cookies in the oven that will either be a tremendous success, or a big fat failure. I'm almost scared to look.
I'm going to NYC in May for the first time!! Any recommendations on what to see (or more importantly--what to EAT)
I hate to say this, but it needs to be said. After cleaning the toilets in my house, it makes me look at my family differently. And not in a good way. Oh Em Gee, GROSS PEOPLE LIVE WITH ME!!!!!!!
Do you "like" Bluebonnets & Brownies yet? She made Nutella Cashew Brownies, so maybe you should!!
Me: Hang on, something's wrong with this YouTube video My 6 year old son: Mom, it's called BUFFERING. Seriously? I did not teach him this. Who is this kid? He had better be prepared to answer a series of tough questions to confirm his identity.
Fudge Brownie Cupcakes with White Chocolate Frosting

SINCE I HAVE HAD ONE ,CHEESE HAS NOT HAD MOLD SO I COULDN'T EAT IT.I HAD ONE FOR MORE THAN 12 YEARS. SAVED ALOT OF $$.
HELP:::: before this thing goes out to our not so big snowdrifts!! It is telling us to empty tray. The tray has been washed, dried and reinserted. both top and bottom. Have tried turning it off and on againand unplugging....... any suggestions???? 
I just got my FoodSaver about an hour ago (literally). This morning, I went to the store and got 5 packs of the value size boneless, skinless chicken breasts (on sale 1/2 off), and used up all the quart size bags that came, and almost an entire roll :) My son (14) and I had a blast doing it though. Then I used the marinating thing for 2 chicken breasts, and they are cooking and sound so delicious. He's also homeschooled, and has started thinking of projects to do with the foodsaver - though I'm drawing the line at resealing the dissection animals!
Valentines Day is next week! Heres a fun idea: vacuum seal heart-shaped cookies, sweetheart candies, and a note in individual bags. Hand them out to co-workers, play-date moms, or the classroom. http://bit.ly/e5LmzK
Just ordered some bags/rolls but it didn't give me a place to enter my code that I have for 10% off.
Help me Foodsaver community -- it's been years since I owned one (please don't banish me) but there are a lot of new products now -- if you were to make soups specifically by the gallon to store/refrigerate/freeze what product(s) would you most recommend 
share with me what you use your jar sealer for??? what items do you store? Thank you. 
Question for the pros: I want to store frozen concentrated orange juice and would you recommend that it be left in the cardboard cans or remove it then store. Or is it something that you would not do.

Have you tried these amazing (EASY) homemade tortilla chips yet? We're having some tonight, with homemade lacto-fermented guacamole. 
Roasted acorn squash soup - I have a similar soup on the menu this week! http://livingfree.aubreecherie.com/2011/02/acorn-squash-soup/
New book coming out Mar 4. I'm getting a review copy and will share more after I've held it in my hands and read it. In the meantime, please "like" the FB page & admire that beautiful cover. What's inside? A Biblically grounded message about the unsustainability of industrial society. If you're going to buy it, do so on Mar 4 via amazon to help the book get up in Amazon's rankings. I'll be hosting a giveaway later.
My husband is going out of town this week and will be eating out quite a bit. To make up for that, I'm packing him some nutrient-dense foods to provide enzymes, probiotics, protein, and good fats: soaked oatmeal, kefir, raw milk, cottage cheese, water kefir, and fermented cod liver oil/butter oil blend. What else would you pack? (I don't have time to make jerky, bummer.)
Free eBook from the Weston A. Price Foundation: "Healthy 4 Life" It is very good! It has dietary guidelines, major nutrient-dense food groups with sample recipes. Thank you, Augie, from the Living Foods Journal for sharing it! Download it and tell me what you think. :-)
What's for dinner? We're having goat stew and biscuits. Our "salad" is kefir with fruit chutney. Dessert: chocolate peanut butter cups and raw milk.
Simple stews are the best, aren't they? This is one of our favorites and now with goat meat in the freezer, we're having it about weekly. In this post, you'll also find a giveaway of the "Simple Food {for winter}" ebook by Shannon of Nourishing Days!

I'm putting the finishing touches on tomorrow's Cultured Dairy lesson (buttermilk and sour cream). I'm so excited for everyone to learn to make this at home - to save money and to make it more health (not to mention more delicious)!
Hey, all you homesteading bloggers! Besides Simple Lives Thursday (which you are doing, right?) here's a new blog hop for you: Homestead Barn Hop! hosted by The Prairie Homestead and Homestead Revival and two others. Begins next Monday. http://theprairiehomestead.blogspot.com/2011/02/announcing-homestead-blog-hop.html
I just adapted the sourdough pancake recipe from the Sourdough eCourse last night to gluten free with roaring success! It actually worked out even better for me than the regular sourdough, for some reason-- I'm not exactly sure why. The only issue I have is that next time, I need to decrease the baking soda, because it's a little more detectable than I like. :-) Thanks Wardeh, Erin and all you awesome GNOWFGLINS!
Just made the Red Meat Stew w/ Sourdough Biscuits from week #8. My hubby (who's mom has always cooked from scratch and has made many a stew) said "BEST STEW EVER!! Don't lose the recipe!" thanks, Wardeh!!
I am just starting to soak grains...when I remember and plan ahead. :) Can yogurt be used? I have been using buttermilk, but for oatmeal, the taste is a bit strong for us. Suggestions?

We're making cultured butter today in the Cultured Dairy and Basic Cheese eCourse! Log in to watch this lesson's 2 videos and download the notes. The forum thread is ready for any questions you have. http://gnowfglins.com/ecourse/members
How do you get along with cast iron? Perhaps these tips will help! In this week's free video I share three tips for working with cast iron, as I fry perfect eggs that do not stick. (Side note: eCourse members, March's thank you video will show you how to season cast iron!)
Do you have a sourdough English muffin recipe on your website?
No room in the fridge for this morning's milk - I'm making cheese. Again. :) What are you making today?
The three duck eggs we collected this morning. One was the tiniest we've ever seen.
What I have been craving (and indulging) all winter is spaghetti squash. My fave way to fix it is tossed with butter and olive oil and seasoned up with garlic, salt and pepper. I've got one in the oven right now - just for me! ;) No, I suppose I'll share some with the kiddoes as they like it, too. Do you like spaghetti squash? How do you eat yours?
What's for dinner? We're having salmon patties with dill sauce, rice, clabbered cheese and fruit, and for dessert chocolate banana shakes. We tend to eat a little more special on the weekends when we have more time together as a family.
Hi Wardeh! Wanted to tell you about black cumin. I don't know if you have heard of it. But it has a lot of health benefits and tastes almost just like pepper. I grind organic black cumin seeds into a pepper consistency and use it in a pepper shaker. :)

Vegan pizza is delicious with daiya!
You just got mentioned on OPRAH! YAY! :)
I just made such a delicious pasta dinner with Daiya, it was so creamy tasting and a perfect comfort food on a cold night.
you guys got the best product placement for vegans and non vegans ever!!!!! you could not have done better. you are the leader at this time in this kind of cheese. i believed in you when you first came out and i had trouble finding it. now whole foods has huge space put aside for your products. you go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! looking forward to some new variations. :) Linda
are you guys going to make cream cheese and sour cream too?
Good cheese is the last step for my becoming a Vegan. I really want to try yours but have to drive 2 hours to buy it:(
Conversation of the day: Kid: I could never go vegan. No, nah ah. Me: What are you talking about? Kid: I love cheese too much. Me: When was the last time you ate cheese? Kid: Uh. . . . Oh, that quesadilla you made me. Remember? It was delicious. Me: That was Daiya, vegan cheese. Kid: Oh, do you have any? Can we make pizzas? 
I heart your cheese! You have changed the way vegans indulge in comfort foods forever. Little did you know when you were a little tot that you would change the vegan diet for the better one day. Thank your mother for us all for force feeding you tapioca!
What's a Thursday without a little puppy love? Introducing #Daiya team member Paul's multi poo Gizmo. Gizmo's favorite Daiya flavor is Mozzarella, which he enjoys best melted on pizza. He prefers a life of leisure, with plenty of back rubs and belly pats.
OMG!!!!!!!! Just got your email about Pepperjack coming out in March. I could not be more excited! I just flipped out when I read the email. YES!!!!! THANK YOU!
Daiya, my husband and I just LOVE your dairy free cheese! It melts so well and tastes great! I first got to try it at Pi in St. Louis on an all veggie vegan pizza and was impressed! Looking forward to trying your new pepperjack cheese! I'm sure it will be amazing! Thanks for making a great product that even my husband enjoys! :)
Congrats! I cannot wait to try the new pepperjack flavor in March:-)
Could you start making your cheese pouches seal-able? The chip clip sometimes slips off, and then there's faux-mozzarella everywhere. It makes me sad. 
Daiya is the number one ingredient in most of my vegan superbowl menu! Pizza, potato skins, nachos, just to name a few. I'm stocking up!
its my fav. I ask for it at vegetarian restraunts. Its good on pizza.
i put in a request a few weeks ago at my local Sprouts market for them to carry Daiya.. when i went shopping today, there it was! and on sale even! I bought 2 Mozz and 2 Cheddar.. Quesadillas for everyone!
When will Daiya come out with slices or blocks of their Creamy Heaven ?
So... if you live in the South Bay, Torrance, or nearby, the Sprouts has Daiya for $3.49 a package!! Be warned, call ahead. I bought 3 packages and left 2. I took the last cheddar and 2 Italian blend. But it seemed to be on sale for a bit longer, so get a raincheck!!
Just used Daiya cheese for the first time on my son's pizza. He is on a Gluten Free Casein Free diet. He LOVED the pizza! Thank you for making a great product!!!
Where do I get this cheese? I live in Canada and have been trying to remove cheese and dairy from my diet for months, the only thing I have found was soy cheese and only to discover that it has dairy. :) This stuff sounds great!!!
I used daiya as part of my taco bar during our superbowl party. It was delicious!!!!
I love Daiya! I used the cheddar style shreds for the first time tonight on the vegan mushroom soup that my husband and I made from scratch and it was simply amazing! I am so glad to have found Daiya. I'm lactose intolerant. It has been hard to shop for products that don't have dairy and eggs in them so Daiya is a blessing!
Is this going to be on sale in Europe? I need it yesterday!!! :-)
My newest recipe w/ Daiya-- thought I'd share Annie's Olive and Sundried Tomato Polenta Pie 1 c yellow corn meal 3.5 c H2O salt pepper 1 Tbs olive oil sml can black olives jar of marinara sundried tomatoes handful frozen corn Cheddar Daiya paprika red pepper flakes Boil 2.5 c H20 Mix cornmeal & 1 c H20 in a bowl, add 1 tsp salt/pepper & mix stirring constantly, pour corn meal mix into boiling water stir regularly til polenta is cooked, 30 to 40 mins. Add more H20 if polenta is too thick to stir, but no more than an extra 1/2 cup while its cooking, dice the olives and sundried tomatoes stir corn, oil, tomatoes, and olives into polenta Pour into a pie pan or small bread pan & press into pan firmly let sit for 20 minutes to firm up Pour marinara on top to cover, & sprinkle with paprika and pepper flakes (optional) Top with a bag (or 1/2 a bag) of Daiya and bake at 300 till cheese melts switch to broiler & remove when cheese is beginning to brown eat 
Just has this for the first time on my pizza and OMG I am so excited!!! Had to go dairy free recently and now I can have cheese again. Thank you Thank you!!!!
Your website says you can freeze the cheese. Does that include freezing it as is? It is on sale in my area and I would love to throw a few bags in the freezer. Thanks!
LOVE IT!! It is the best vegan cheese I have had. My 2 yr old, 10 yr old and 14 yr old were eating it right out of the bag! I melted mine on my lentil spagetti sauce :) Thank you!!
We want Daiya vegan cheese in France!! Please!!! :)
What can we do to get you guys selling in Brazil? Honestly, life it tough without Daiya even if it IS sumher here...
We are having pizza night tonight because we just discovered our local health food grocer stocks Tofurky frozen pizzas, made with Daiya cheese, in their freezer section!!! I love making pizza from scratch but it sure is nice to know there is a ready made product out their when I don't have the time!
Thank you so much for your product! We just found out that my daughter is allergic to casein, so finding y'all has made this transition easier!
We're Orthodox Jews and while not Vegan, don't mix meat and cheese. A Vegan friend suggested we see if Daiya was Kosher and try it out. We were happy to see that it was and we did. Using a recipe from this month's Food Network Magazine, my wife made a lasagna with your mozzarella substitute and a non dairy Bchamel sauce for Friday night's Shabbat meal. I honestly thought we'd made a mistake and used real mozzarella. It was that good. Thank you for this amazing product, and for making it available to the Kosher consumer.
Hi Daiya! I've been encouraging a local restaurant to carry your cheese. He said he's having trouble finding a local wholesaler. Any thoughts about who I can recommend for San Francisco, California?
Thanks for the great 'cheeze' fix.. As a vegan - I occasionally cheated for a small bite of cheeze.. Now I am so happy...Now I wish you could come up with a feta option :)
I just stumbled upon your FB page and I am so excited to try your product as dairy is my tummy's enemy!
I love you guys. I wasn't sure I could become a vegan until I found you (and coconut milk ice cream)! I can't wait for the pepperjack flavor!
I'm having a hard time finding your product (cheese). My 2 year old has a soy and dairy allergy, and I'm at a loss for what to feed him. And because he can't eat dairy, my almost 4 year old can't eat cheese (regular), because if my 2 year old sees him, he wants some too! Help!
anything in the works for mozzarella sticks yet? have you ever thought about doing vegan paneer cheese? that would be amazing!
Tonight I made our favorite Vegan Mac-n-cheeze recipe but added Diaya cheddar cheese on top. WOW! We loved it! We will be adding Diaya cheese to some of our dishes occasionally due to the high fat content. But when we do... we will make every bite count! :-) 
I tried daiya shredded cheese for the first time. LOVED IT! Tastes great, texture is nice, and it DOES melt and stretch like cheese. Nice product! it will become a staple in my house.
years ago, when I was in my early twenties, there was a vegan family that traveled around having cooking classes to show people how to make and eat better meals. I loved it. there was a little seven year old boy there that made cheese out of millet seed, it was the best cheese I've ever eaten. had the consistency like Velveeta cheese, but way healthier. you don't by any chance, have a recipe like that, do you? 
finally available in my local grocery store...now I can have melted cheddar on my veggie chili...and it's the last link on my path to veganism :)))))
Just discovered Daiya at my son's school. Delicious! I can't wait to start cooking with it. Thanks to the kitchen staff at the Maine School of Science and Mathematics for finding this and telling me about it. We are the poster family for food allergy. This is going to make a big difference in our lives!
Happy Family Day Canada (except BC, NS, and NB residents who are working right now--meaning us) and Happy Presidents Day USA! 3 day weekends may just be the best thing ever. How are you spending your extra day off?
Thank you, Daiya! I'm a vegan, and I recently gave birth. My six-week-old son is allergic to soy in breastmilk, so I've had to cut out soy in any form (even trace bits in candies etc). Your cheeses have made life livable! The mac 'n cheese recipe on your web site is absolutely fantastic. Again, THANK YOU!
Thanks for inventing the best vegan cheeze ever! I just whipped up a delicious batch of potato broccoli cheddar soup for this snowy Pittsburgh night. YUM!
We just made our first batch of Vegan Tacos with your "Cheddar Cheese"...THANK YOU!!!!!! What an amazing and delicious product!!!! You ROCK \m/\m/
last night I made eggplant parm. & topped with your mozzerella! OMG, such good stuff! 
Best Cheese ever!!!!!!!!!! Thank you!
We look forward to a distribution of vegan cheese Daiya in France...
any chance of you all working on a grated parmesan flavored topping?
When is the roll out date for the Pepperjack flavor? Super excited!!!
I had vegan mozzarella sticks today at my favourite vegan cafe (the only one) in Syracuse, NY, Strong Hearts Cafe. The first time in over 16 years. They were so amazing. I can't wait to make them on my own! I am so happy they use your cheese in their dishes. Pizza night is always a big draw!
Love this cheese! Now I don't have to feel deprived any more. I eat gluten, dairy and soy free, so this is a wonderful addition to my diet...Thanks!
omg i tried the tofurkey daiya cheese pizza that i got at whole foods the other night and omfg!!! it was soooooooooo good! totally blew any other premade vegan pizza i had out of the water. it was absolutely delicious and tasted exactly like a regular cheese pizza. i was beside myself. 
So guys, when are you starting a daiya factory in Europe, so we can start enjoying some Daiya cheese?
I really enjoy your cheese. I had it at Cruzer's, and also at Whole Foods. Bravo!
Hi! I would like to know if your products contain palm oil? thanks by advance for your response!^^
We bought this 'cheese' very recently and will buy it again, it's amazingly 'cheese like' just like the package says, pleasantly surprised! yahoo
Please make blue or goat cheese your next flavor!!!!
What about Swiss Cheese flavor? That would be all kinds of yum! :)
Any chance you could export this cheese to Mauritius? getting more and more Vegan people here... :) 
Thought you might appreciate this story. I have a friend who's been vegetarian for about six years but never went vegan because she "couldn't give up cheese." I introduced her to Daiya a few months ago and she just told me she's been vegan for seven weeks. Her quote: "It's the closest thing to cheese that I've ever tasted."
LOVE your product, as it finally lets me make GFCFSF pizza for my son... but wondering if you have any tips on how to get the cheese to melt better/more in the oven when cooking pizza (without having to turn the crust into an overcooked hard crispy brick by leaving it in too long?) Thanks so much!
This is one of our vegan pies with Daiya.
Is there any out-lets for Daiya Vegan Cheese in New Zealand?
just tried this cheese...amazing!! Thank you so much. I have been vegetarian for almost three years now. I'd like to go vegan but cheese has always been a weakness. This product will definitely make it easier. Can't wait to see what else you come up with!
I have been vegan for almost 5 years and I have never been a fan of vegan cheeses. They never melt right and usually taste not that great. But I saw Daiya shredded mozzerella the other day and figured I should give it a try. All I can say is WOW!! This is really a great vegan cheese. And it melts so well! I am impressed! Even my sister, who is not vegan, said that this cheese was good! I hope I can find cheddar next time.
Dussa's Ham and Cheese on Granville Island in Vancouver Canada is clearing out all its bulk shreds and loaves. $0.98/100grams while supplies last!

I <3 Daiya! It's the only Vegan Cheese I use now =) These turned out so good and it was soooooo easy to make. All I did was line a baking dish with corn tortillas and start layering. I do layers instead of the traditional roll up way of making them because to me it's easier =) I used Daiya vegan cheese (cheddar and mozzarella) green chillies, black beans, and enchilada sauce. I think it was 3 layers. I baked it at 425* for 20 minutes. All the cheese melted soooooo nice. You can top it with vegan sour cream, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, olives...what ever you like! DELICIOUS! Thanks to the cheese! =D
Happy Monday, hope you had a fabulous weekend! Have you checked out the new Vegan Zombie video for Daiya Cheesesteak?

Some scientists are now saying that Tropical Race Four, a soil-borne fungus, could wipe out worldwide banana production in the next decade. This banana blight has already devastated crops in Asia and Australia. When it hits Latin America we are going to have a serious banana shortage. Never underestimate the stupidity of monoculture. (Over 99% of the bananas sold for export are of one variety the Cavendish.)

Can you tell us more about what's included on that day's preset gala menu? I've been unable to find any specifics on the restaurant website or elsewhere. We're very much looking forward to the romantic ambiance of the Eiffel Tower as we celebrate our special occasion this coming Monday.
Eiffel Tower Restaurant: We have reservations for SIX this Friday eve at 6:30 (FEB 18th) would luvvvvv to treat the grandparents & relatives (travelling from Hawaii & Chicago) to a table next to the window & Bellagio fountain view... this is our first time @ your restaurant & we've heard the ambiance/view is to die & dine for!! ~B.

Celine Dion has returned to The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Tickets on sale now for dates through August. We would be happy to offer restaurant reservations for your show date.
Do you have a romantic story of a special date or proposal at Eiffel Tower Restaurant?

HERSHEY'S Milk Chocolate Bar has been spreading happiness for over a century. How have you spread a little happiness today?
Ivory Coast is on the brink of a war that could cause unspeakable bloodshed. Please end your company's trade with Laurent Gbagbo and his forces and immediately and publicly commit to working only with President Alassane Ouattara's democratically elected government. Gbagbo relies on revenues and tariffs from cocoa exports to finance his repressive troops perpetuating his illegal grip on power. Millions of Ivorians risked their lives to vote last month. Your urgent action now could tip the balance towards democracy and save lives."
Hershey, please stop using child labor in developing countries to pick your cacao. I am very alarmed to learn of such practices and am very disappointed. In such a globalized world you ought to know better and do better by choosing not to allow such horrendous practices. Many other chocolate companies have done the right thing and you absolutely should too!!!! http://www.thedarksideofchocolate.org/ 
I am horrified to read that cocoa is produced using forced and child labor, particularly in the Ivory Coast. Children who have been trafficked report being beaten, forced to work 12 to 14 hours without pay, and given little food and sleep. Hershey's refuses to identify its cocoa suppliers, and in addition has not taken the steps some of its competitors have to use independent certifying organizations to ensure that cocoa is produced without exploiting children. Hershey, please have a heart!
Over nine years since chocolate companies committed to ending child labor, forced labor, and trafficking in their cocoa supply chains, these egregious labor rights abuses continue. http://www.raisethebarhershey.org/
To: David West, This year, I want to be sure that the chocolate kisses I give to my loved ones dont break the hearts of cocoa farmers. I want to give my friends and family chocolate that was produced responsibly, without the use of child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking. As Americas largest and oldest chocolate manufacturer, Hershey has the responsibility to lead the industry in ensuring workers rights, from bean to bar. Its time for Hershey to Raise the Bar by tracing the sources of its cocoa, working to eliminate child and forced labor, and shifting to Fair Trade Certified cocoa.
have a heart this Valentine's day!! Commit to sourcing fair trade cocoa and end child labor abuses
Have a heart on Valentines Day! Its time to raise the bar by stopping child labor and using Fair Trade Certified cocoa! 
Have a heart on Valentines Day! Its time to raise the bar by stopping child labor and using Fair Trade Certified cocoa!
Hershey: Have a heart on Valentines Day! Its time to raise the bar by stopping child labor and using Fair Trade Certified cocoa! http://bit.ly/HersheyCo 
As a chocolate consumer, I am deeply concerned about labor rights abuses in the cocoa industry. Forced labor, trafficking and child labor continue on West Africa's cocoa farms. Please consider Fair Trade Chocolate this Valentines Day! Thank you!
Have a heart on Valentines Day! Its time to raise the bar by stopping child labor and using Fair Trade Certified cocoa

We want fair labor and fair trade standards before we will buy your chocolate again. Stop child labor now!!!
Our school is the first Fair Trade High School in the U.S. We took vigorous action against modern day slavery as high school students, now it is your turn as a company to be more ethical and responsible. Will you be a perpetrator or an abolitionist? It is your choice in deciding how you treat your laborers. And we as consumers have a choice in choosing products that do not use slavery. Will you step up and have a heart?
I would be much more likely to buy your chocolate if it were Fair Trade. Fair Trade= more money for you= more chocolate for me= a step against slavery. Really, I think the choice is quite obvious.... A haiku for Hershey's: Chocolate is tasty but a bite of delicious just is not worth it. 
Today is National Almond Day! Do you like your HERSHEYS Milk Chocolate with or without Almonds?
happy national almond day!!:D
Happy Valentine's Day from Hershey! How will you be spreading happiness to your Valentine?
HERSHEY'S Miniatures are a sweet treat for the Big Game. What other treats will you be serving at a party this Sunday?

The big game is just around the corner! Will it be the powerful offense from Wisconsin or the intimidating defense from Pittsburgh that wins the day? Share you predictions with the rest of your WinCo friends!
I love Winco. The artisanal baguette is very good, but not as good as Trader Joe's.
What your friends are saying about us: "Thanks to Kat and Sharon's recent posts about loving WinCo, I ventured there today for the first time. I was so thrilled with all of the fresh and bulk food items that I had to call someone. I called Kat. She didn't answer. I called my mom. She couldn't talk. How is a girl supposed to rejoice over bulk food if no one will answer their phone? So, I just pushed that cart around the store in giddy delight, loading it up with all sorts of deliciousness!" - Mia W.
Do you still carry Aussie Gold white cheddar cheese in your store? When we shopped at your store in the Renton/Kent Wa area you guys had it but we can't find it in your Orem, UT store.
I work at the Airport Super8 in Salt Lake City, Utah I want to thank you guys for keep sending the nice Drivers to us Like Ken Luther, Terry Crites, Chris Rangel, Tom Gould, Jason Jaussi, and all the rest of the Drivers are way. We do enjoy there Company, they are all good friends. Thanks agian.. Keep sending them are way... 
Why are the business neighbors in Layton telling everyone that you are trying to back out of your commitment to build a store there in Layton? Is it true? I hope not. I would travel past many other brands to shop there.
Suggestion: I would love to go to only one store (orem winco). Could you have more organic produce and an organic section. Suggestions would be organic or raw cheese, ezekial cereal. Also, for my wife she would love for you to carry more dark chocolate choices (endagered species she would love).
Is Winco gonna have a super bowl sale? I heard we were to surpose to get coupons in the mail. Its been awhile?
Where can I find the nutrition information on your in house items like Deli Sandwiches?
BEST store ever!!! Do you take food requests?? Most of the time when I stop in the bagels are slim pickins. 
love love love winco! I live in atwater ca & drive 30min to the nearest one in modesto ca. Winco puts out an ad every so often with coupons and i was wondering how i can get on the mailing list?
I heard a Winco is coming to Glendale, AZ --- any news on that?
I drive 25 miles twice a month to make it to your store for all the good deals and i am usually very pleased with your guys' products.. Then i bought a pack of ribs from you and went to make them and they were spoiled my whole house stunk for hours just from opening the bag and 10 dollars down the drain. When i called the meat department he said"yeah we got some bad meat but we dont know what packages they are in, were not going to open everyone to find out. So just bring it back" well if i lived just down the street i would have done that. But i dont. Just thought you guys should know. Thanks!
I need Zatarain's Creole Mustard. Any chance it can be added to the store? Possibly the best I've tasted.
yea iaked befor but it im looking for is like cheese whipe but in white monterey jack style do you guys have i knw you guys have the alfrado flavor??
Dear Winco, I really love your stores and especially your low prices. However, I made the decision to go to a competitive store in the Meridian area today because I am tired of the poor quality of your produce department. I did pay more but I'm more satisfied with my produce from the other store. Please pass this comment on to the appropriate people in your organization. I buy a lot of fresh produce every week for our family of 7 and I really want to become a fan of your produce department and shop in your store again!!!! Thank you.
I have never been to a WinCo but my son told me how great your store is and I was wondering if this is true that WinCo will be opening a new store in Tacoma Washington? I would love to visit your store if one is closer
Hey I know you guys don't publish circular store adds often just for new store opennings and the occational special event so my question is two fold how do i make sure i'm on the mailing list for when you do have a mailer go out and two what is the best most accurate way to see upcoming sales and good deals in your store before I get there. I have a very tight schedule and budget so I like to do as much planning before a big shopping trip at home in the evening when the kids are in bed. That way I can have a game plan when we are there and get whats on my list and go. I like to plan my meals around sales to keep our food costs down. Any ideas to help me look for sales quickly and efficiantly and plan our meals around sales?
Do you have a listing of what items are available in your bulk foods section I shop at the lacey store and I was just thinking that there are so many things we buy with all the extra packaging and cost just out of habit. When I am standing in your bulk food section though I have to admit I get a little overwhelmed with all the choices (love all the choices) I feel like I am always missing something I could buy in bulk just because I'm not used to buying it there. Just the other day I discovered your Stash tea in Bulk foods .08 a bag and I get to pick the flavors yeah no left over stinky camomile in the bottom of the box! It just made me wonder just how many other staple items I buy all the time are in that section that I have been missing!
Does your West Hillsboro store carry Arrowroot?
Dear Winco, I love baking bread....in fact we bake all of our bread. Winco has a great bulk food section but asking for a UNBLEACHED UNBROMATED BREAD FLOUR. It is a much better flour product for bread making. I have noticed that your do handle a unbleached flour from Bob's Red Mill (my favorite products) but am wondering if this is unbromated? I have on numerous occassions put in a request and never received an answer. I have resorted to going to the packaged flours and buying the Gold Medal "better for bread" unbleached, unbromated flour. I shop my West Hillsboro Winco...and love it!!
Would really love to see a new store in Salmon, Idaho. I currently drive 3 hours to shop at your idaho falls store. We only have one grocery store in Salmon, But with your lower prices, you would attract many from Montana also. We also have the new Cobalt mine coming in the next year here so there will be alot going on in Salmon in the near future. Just your meat prices alone I save enough to pay for gas to travel to idaho falls
I hope you move to the East Coast! You've figured out how to lower the cost of grocery shopping! Right on!
Here's hoping that there will be no lines at my favorite store, store 6, during the game :-D
To the Winco buyers, why was Yo-plus dropped from the yogurt section. My toddlers eat it and I was just besides myself when I went there tonight and couldn't find it. I had to drive all the way over to Thriftway (after a 12 hours shift at the hospital), just for yogurt for tomorrow's preschool snack. Would love to see it back on the shelf again. Strawberry please.
Do you happen to carry vital wheat gluten or garam masala in the bulk bins? I know it's a stretch...
I just discovered your FB page and saw some WinCo deals from, I think, Idaho---are those also for the Utah stores?
Is there an estimated opening date for the WinCo going in on 72nd in Tacoma?
How can I order a case of Del Monte Sweet Pickle Relish (UPC041660105520)?
I love shopping at Winco.. I was visiting on Sunday and talked to a server of demo's. That is so nice.. I would like to do that line of work. Can you hook me up with the company that hires demo workers.. thank you..See you next Sunday..Message or deanahovey@yahoo.com 
love winco people are friendly and customer driven, savings are spectacular, I get excellent service, low prices, and no grumpy union workers! I am able to feed a family of 5 for less than $400 a month! Winco rocks and I even like the little birds that seem to flying around every store I've been too!

We first went to Winco when we were in Eureka CA, and loved it! I can't wait for the new one to open in Tacoma.
Oh my I hope we start getting store ads with coupons they look awesome. I wish Winco would carry more fat free dairy products.
i love getting honey from winco...and i watch out for the live bees ;) can you tell me if it's raw honey?
How many of our friends are looking forward to traveling during Spring Break or just a quick get-away from the cold? Keep on saving even while you travel by finding the closest WinCo near you! Map & Directions >> http://ow.ly/3TVxt

Hello, I had a real quick question... Is there an online resource where I may review Winco's official policies? ~James T. Store #67
The store in Meridian has started to carry Dave's Killer Bread. I love the Good Seed Bread and am glad I no longer have to travel to S.E. Idaho to get good-tasting bread with lots of fiber :-)
They're baaack! As we continue our commitment to provide quality items at the lowest possible prices, we're proud to announce the return of Del Monte bananas to all WinCo locations.

When does tacoma store open?
Could you please contact me with the information for the Spokane area GM. I witnessed the worse security guard encounter yesterday, have filed a police report and the SPD requested I file a formal complaint with your GM. I called the store and the assistant manager refused to speak to me and the lady who answered the phone refused to give me the information. You can read my status on my facebook page to see what happened. I appreciate getting the information so I can write my letter. Thank you!
When will your Tacoma store be opening?
Does WinCo carry Duram Wheat Flour??
I have always loved WinCo, however I am a little frustrated. Over the last two months I have purchased expired food! My eggs where expired by one day last month and then today my three packs of hostess cakes where really expired! One March of 08! Other 9/09 then last one 03/10!! I love the store , great prices but can't understand what the problem is?? I never thought I would have to take the time to check every items expiration date before I bought is , so frustrating!!
I am having Winco withdrawls since we moved to Ventura CA. There are rumors that we are getting one soon, but I cant find anything on your web site. Do you have any news?
Are you new to WinCo and wondering what the color on our price tags mean? It's all about savings! Look for items marked with GREEN price tags to find items on SALE; look for items marked with yellow for our every day low prices! Know someone that is new to WinCo, spread the word please..happy savings everyone!
Thanks WinCo, for being an awesome store, and for being affordable so our family can afford to eat and eat well :) I have one teeny gripe: why is the deli making salads w/'junk' lettuce now? They used to make the salads with leafy greens and now they're using iceberg lettuce. I'm aware it may be more expensive to use the leafier lettuces, but I think I'd be willing to pay a little bit more for a healthier salad. They're the same price now w/the iceberg as they were w/the better lettuce. Thanks for your time.

Just curious as Im a Winco Foods Employee (Eureka CA) my self, is the Roseville store back open, or are they still closed because of the fire?
Just wanted to let you know how much I enjoy this interaction with Winco. The personal touch is much appreciated. 
I wish WinCo would carry either Hormel Natural Choice or Oscar Meyer Natural lunch meats. Neither of these have nitrites, but all the choices available at WinCo have the nasty stuff in them. Pleeeeeease???
When is the Tacoma store going to open?!
I moved to the Northwest in August and upon my arrival I was guided to WinCo by my friend. I was amazed at the prices, selection and quality. I know it is impossible to carry all the items on the market, but WinCo hits the mark pretty close. Thank you WinCo for making grocery shopping enjoyable again!!!
My wife and I drive 60 miles each way now to the new Winco in Lacey Wa monthly shopping. I love the new store but in the produce department where they have mushrooms etc, NO SCALE. I brought this to the stores attention last trip and they agreed that area lacked a scale and said they would put one up .........Not yet :(
Sigh....two months since moving from Temecula, CA to Orange County (Anaheim), and I am having serious WinCo withdrawals, especially the bulk bin. Nothing here even comes close in pricing or selection. You guys even started carrying Udi's, which was so GREAT! Now I have to go to separate stores for everything. Ugh. I'm seriously considering the 35+ min. drive to the one in Pamona once a month for major grocery shopping. Please come to Orange County soon!!! :(
Do you carry Pistachio Ice Cream?
Any updates on when the Lakewood, CA Winco will be up and running? I can't wait!!
so when is the winco in tacoma,wa opening............also when will it start hiring an how can i apply!! so excited i dont have to get on the freeway to get my food
Sure would love to see some licorice pastels in bulk ... please!!! =-)
I heard that there will be a winco opening up in Tacoma,washington. is this true? If so,when? 
I used to live in Meridian, ID and a few years ago I moved to Arizona. I've heard rumors that Winco is looking to set up some stores in the Phoenix area and that makes me really excited! I always used to shop at your stores when I lived up north and I miss them alot! Also, please know that if (and when) you come here, you have at least five people that will be "jumping ship" to apply at the nearest store. :)
I live 3 hours away from your nearest store and make the trip once or twice a month. Is there a website I can go to to get your sales flyer to plan my visits?
Thank you to all of my Lacey Winco Co workers For this beautiful congrats cake for me wedding~I love my job at Win Co~
This is a long time delayed - but I love Winco and I've only been there once although it's only because of distance and I can't wait until I have the opportunity to visit again! My husband and I went there on Thanksgiving day and I was stoked to be able to stock on some pantry goods - when we got to the checkstand the associate told us we qualified for a very good deal on a turkey and held our order. She could have just ignored it but she didn't. Thanks for the extra mile!!
I just read a months worth of posts and I have to say that I am impressed with all of WinCos responses. Whether faced with praises, questions, comments or complaints, you respond with care, concern and resprect. It just reaffirms my trust in a great company and makes me proud to call myself a costumer. Thank you!
Something I've been trying to figure out WinCo; is the Deli Express meat the same as what's behind the counter? Also where can I find the specifics about the meat? whether artificial preservatives, coloring and that sort are used or not? 
I have a question with a scenerio for you, if you could answer for me please? $1.00 off any (insert brand name here) item. Some of the items in the store with this brand name are .63c. Would Winco accept and just adjust the coupon to .63c, or would they reject it altogether? I understand that making money from the coupon isn't going to happen and not expecting that. Thank you!
Just saw that a store is coming to Henderson, NV. Can't wait for it to open.
Bar S franks at winco in Lacey are .88c. If you are a coupon clipper, and have recent inserts there is a coupon for $1/2 (that's $1.00 off two) Bar S franks or bologna. That's .76c for two packages of franks! Cannot beat Winco's prices - use coupons with them and the deals are shocking! Thanks Winco!
On Monday we went to the Orem, UT store to let the kids pick a treat from the bulk section for a movie night. I was very VERY disappointed because my son picked swedish fish and when we ate them they were hard as a rock and disgusting. Just wanted to let you know. I don't know how you keep track of the items in those bins but these obviously weren't changed out for a while. We ended up throwing them all away.
Im a huge fan of your stores around the sacramento CA area, Tonight I went to my usual winco inn Folsom. In just too let anyone here are the manager know, I will never go after 11 pm. For my mental stability I will avoid the rude lady at winco, "Who leaves a bell at the register".. Who doesn't show up until 5 minutes later in 3 rings, Than she states. " It doesn't make her run any faster, If I ring it more than once". Than theirs about 5 to 8 guys sitting off in the end. Standing around, talking... I love the lady who is their around 11 pm, when I usually will go inn. :)
I went to the web site and had my "what happened to the coupons in the mail" question answered. It is a 45 minute drive each way for me to get to WinCo. How do I find out when there is a sale?
Sticker shock, stopped at a local chain grocery store for a "few items" until I get to Winco on Sunday, spent $53 on NOTHING, most prices were $1.25 MORE then WINCO, no joke, I am so thankful for this store, I can't imagine what our food bill would be without it!!
Last weekend I bought two of your take and bake pizzas, took them home popped them in the freezer. We cooked them today and they were so tasty. But I was wondering if you guys have take and bake breadsticks too? If NOT you so SHOULD! I loved the crust and it would make a really good breadstick. Um just a thought from a satisfied shopper! =) Love your Orem store!
I think the batch of 1% Hytop milk in the Orem, Ut store with expiration listed as March 11 is spoiled. I bought 3 gallons and they were all bad. Do I need the receipt to return them?
Ok, here's a weird question: What kind of cheese is on your Italian subs? It is white. American? Provolone? My hubbs loves it!
I just sent you a email on the website, and I have visited quite a few of your stores, but you need to build a store in Central Oregon! There are at least 10 other major areas that would have customers going from there hometowns to Bend Oregon just to go to Winco! Please bring one here!

Took my little boy for his first GBK trip today and he loved it! he had cajun chicken pieces and lots of my chips with tomato ketchup - he was intrigued by the big red tomatoes! Where can we get one?
WINNERS The next time we want to know the future, well get in touch with you guys. Two people guessed the exact score for the Wales vs. England game. Two! Usually wed settle this with a coin toss, but perfect predictions should both be rewarded. So congrats to Andrea Evans and Simon Parker, youre both going to get lovely GBK vouchers in the post. Well be in touch.
VALENTINES WINNER Aw, you romantics, you. Thanks for reducing our FB team to a blubbering mess yesterday folks. The winner was hard to pick, especially with so many brilliant lines and funny retorts. However, who knew that Winnie the Pooh was a stone cold romantic!? Anna Hesp did, quoting A. A. Milnes work brilliantly, and winning that GBK feast. Great work Anna! Tissue please, were getting teary eyed again
VALENTINES DAY COMPETITION Romantics (and cynics), your time is now! To celebrate (or not) Valentines day with us, we need to hear your best (or worst) romantic line from your favourite song or film. The winner gets a feast - 50 in glorious GBK lovin to share with their loved one (or others) either tomorrow or whenever they want. Make us laugh! (Make us wince.) Either way, you have until 10pm tonight. Go!
RUGBY WINNER It was like watching a Range Rover with bull bars smash a flaming Fiat of a cliff. Even those rugby aficionados in the southern hemisphere would have been stroking their chins at the masterclass Martin Johnsons boys put on yesterday. Making most of your predictions moot, and Tim Elwine the eternal optimist and winner! Well done Tim. We'll be in touch.
6 NATIONS COMPETITION - Ok desperados, its rugby time again, as England play Italy at Twickenham tomorrow. Will Martin Johnsons men smash the plucky Italians with speed, power and trickery? Or will they do a Chevy Chase tumble backwards down a flight of stairs after the heights of last week? Who knows. YOU do! Post your best guess here. Prizes to the winner(s), as usual. Good luck.
Happy Waitangi Day people. If youre wandering the countryside and stumble across the odd celebrating Kiwi, impress them with your knowledge that the Treaty of Waitangi in NZ was signed in 1840. Thatll get a cheers bro! from anyone hailing from the youngest country in the world. Friendly folk, great with hobbits and rugby, and awesome at burgers. We love all that, but especially the last part.
Hey GBK! Any plans on entering into Eastern markets anytime soon?? Coz u guys would make a FORTUNE in Pakistan. Your average Pakistani can put a seasoned Sumo to shame when it comes to burgers, so it's worth looking into! 
REASONS TO VISIT JERSEY - Aw, we felt like proud parents yesterday as another GBK franchise took flight. The Isle of Jersey is now home to its very first GBK, making the 88,000 residents of this little land most happy indeed. If youre popping over to shop for shoes or take in the sites, be sure to drop in and say hi. Well done Jersey-ites! Enjoy those glorious burgers.
Just Opened here in Jersey (U.K.Channel Islands,the original JERSEY OK) and I can't wait to go to it,Tomorrow, MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM BURGERRRRRRR!!!!!!!
My heart is beating , keeps on repeating I'm waiting for you- Soraya
If perfects what your searching for then just stay the same! - Bruno Mars!
How come I couldn't use my taste card tonight - your battersea store told me it was a "holiday" tonight.... excuse me? Not exactly busy tonight, you're a burger joint!! I just walked out, FYI, and won't be coming back
I had a fantastic meal at the GBK at Cabot Circus in Bristol on Saturday night. I'm a Coeliac, so finding anywhere that does Gluten Free can be a nightmare. The member of staff I spoke to there - Lianne - was brilliant and v.knowledgeable. Many thanks :-)
Hi there, I run a student discount card and we are currently expanding across the country and after eating at GBK many times before it would be great to get you on board. Who's best to speak to about this? Keep up the good work!
The Beastie Boys vs. Burt Bacharach - Music to eat burgers by, currently being discussed by us on Twitter. Get tweeting @gbkburgers and let us know what you think, and to also have a chance at Finding the Elusive Kiwi to win prizes. Meanwhile, right here on FB, were thinking of creating the ultimate breakfast burger. A Sunday Morning hangover killer. What goes in this beast of a burger tho?
Behold! A Breakfast Burger! After all of your remarkable suggestions a few hours ago, we decided to have a crack. A freshly toasted bun with mayo, mushrooms, spicy bbq beans, 3 strips of bacon with melted cheese on top, and a runny egg to boot. Wonderful. Big thanks to GBK Putney for assembling this beauty and letting us run riot. And yes, it was GLORIOUS. Now, who wants one?
What thethat elusive Kiwi staff member is missing! Which can only mean one thing hes lunching at a GBK in LONDON soon, ready to reward whoever finds him first with dinner for you and 3 mates, anytime you want. This afternoon his GBK location will be announced on Twitter @gbkburgers. (Then, maybe, on FB, because we love you all.) Just go to that restaurant and say youre looking for the Kiwi to win.
Happiness part 1 - Meet Richard, who managed to find our elusive Kiwi diner in Covent Garden, nabbing 50 of GBK lovin' in the process. The sweat on his brow testament to the speed of his dash. Totally worth it! The Kiwi wont be twittering another location until next week, as weve gaffer taped him to a stool and forced him to slice onion rings all day. Now THAT was entertaining.
If I do a series of crazy tasks in Leeds can I get a discount on GBK here, seriously I will do almost anything, I just need a GBK asap :D
Hey Burger guys! so we organised a big lunch trip to have lunch at your spitafields branch, and when people DID manage to pick up the phone at the resturant they said you don't do booking. I said i had 10 people, and i didnt want to bring them all there for them not to be able to get lunch, and he said thankyou and put the phone down on me!!! how rude! Can I Seriously not book? Why don't you want our business :(
Your burger in Jeddah, was yummie!!
Just used the HCC voucher for a double avocado and bacon burger in Oxford with a friend who graduated last: great food + great company = great times! Thanks very much GBK:-)
Thanks for the feeding of a noisy bunch of hungry teenagers this afternoon whilst still smiling at the guardians that were trying to disown them :)
If lunch is your thing (and lets face it, it really should be) then GBK has your back homie. Scope out this latest voucherless offer one of our smaller 4oz classic burgers and chips for a punitive 5.95. If youre a hungry chum at lunch, upgrade that burger to full size for a mere 1.50! Sweetly satisfied or full as a bull, its in your hands. Monday to Friday folks, 12pm till 5pm. See you there.
TAKE 2 - If lunch is your thing (and lets face it, it really should be) then GBK has your back homie. Scope out this latest voucherless offer one of our smaller 4oz classic burgers and chips for a puny 5.95. If youre a hungry chum at lunch, upgrade that burger to full size for a mere 1.50! Sweetly satisfied or full as a bull, its in your hands. Monday to Friday folks, 12pm till 5pm. See you there.
When will you guys be offering nutritional info? I noticed that you are selling burgers in the chilled section of waitrose. Is that the same burger you sell in your restaurants?
Do you think you guys could do something to support the victims of the Christchurch earthquake??? There are loads of us kiwi's over here in the UK who I'm sure would donate!!
RUGBY COMPETITION - Lo and behold its time for the 6 Nations, where large men representing their country smash each other senseless, and occasionally a rugby game breaks out. With our Kiwi roots GBK loves a good game of rugby, and England vs. Wales tonight is a grudge match of Ali vs. Foreman proportions. So whos going to win? Post your final score here! The closest guess wins a meal for 2 at a GBK! Good luck.
Once again, thanks for a great evening: triple-generational family get-together at GBK before my twin sis goes off to Madrid to pick at tapas for five months! Completely different topic, but do you guys have anymore of the Kiwiburger wrist bands left?
ROYALE WITH CHEESE A lady called Kate is marrying some prince-type called William soon. And were guessing that after all the wedding hype and magazine covers, theyll want to venture down to their nearest GBK for a smashin good burger. Oh yes. Thing is what goes in a Royal Burger? If you think you have princely taste buds and could cook a burger fit for a King and Queen, post your creation right here...
you guys should do delivery! I'd drive for you if you wanted (payment only accepted in burgers)
6 NATIONS COMP Ok England, reality check time. Sure, Ashtons been swan-diving his way around the paddock like Tarzan, and Johnson was spotted smiling for the first time since 93 (He didnt smile when he lifted the World Cup. That was a snort) BUT can they snuff out Les Bleus? Those French usually only turn up for games against the All Blacks in quarter finals, but who knows? YOU do! Post your final score here..
Kiwi burger forever
classic burger 
you guys should do a Christchurch burger, and then give a pound of the price to the recovery effort! 
6 NATIONS COMP WINNER England won, Ashton swan-dived, Johnson grimaced. Just as predicted, although the French did make things entertaining. The best of your final score guesses were Lorraine Johnson and David Sykes, meaning wed have to settle this with pistols at dawn. Or a coin toss. It was Lorraine who guessed heads, meaning she wins dinner for 2 at her local GBK! Marvellous.
Morning GBkers. Some great news. You can all bask in the satisfaction of helping those in need, as stats from our final Help a Capital Child charity effort put the total amount raised over the 4 campaigns at a barnstorming 203,000! Well done team. Take a victory lap around the workplace while the boss isnt looking. Youve earned it.
Valentines Day a celebration of love and romance, or a cynical marketing tool for those dastardly gift card companies? You decide. Regardless, this Monday the 14th of Feb well be hungry one way or another, and our burgers are the food of love. So if youre wanting to win a wonderful romantic (or not) dinner on us, stay tuned! Well be running something rather lovely on Sunday, right here...
FIND THE KIWI COMPETITION! Were on Twitter did you know? And following us on Twitter is going to be loadsa fun. Each week were playing a game called Find the Kiwi, where 1 of our Kiwi staffers will be lunching in a GBK somewhere in the UK. It could be any restaurant. Hell tweet his position, and if you find him first you win dinner for 2 at GBK! Instant fun! Follow us @gbkburgers on Twitter to hunt him down

Was just over on the Mom It Forward forums and read about Blue Monday, which is today. "This date was calculated by using many factors, including: weather conditions, debt level (the difference between debt accumulated and our ability to pay), time since Christmas, time since failing our new years resolutions, low motivational levels and feeling of a need to take action."
Had my first tastes of Westminster Cracker Company oyster crackers today and soooooo good! Can't wait to share them with you all at Soup-a-Palooza!

Look and feel your best with these anti-aging diet tips from Elizabeth Somer, R.D.
Walking through a Publix store in Tampa I came upon Roman Meal Sun Grain bread and really like the see-through style packaging. Even though I was traveling I had to buy some and give it to my client in Tampa to take home and make some grilled cheese sandwiches. Yum Yum... Don Morgan, Bellevue, Washington
Seems to be a recurring question where can I find Roman Meal 12 grain in my area? In the past I could find it at any one of a number of stores in my area. I've checked the following stores and can't find it... Giant, Shoppers, Safeway, Super Fresh, BJs. Please tell me where I can find it again. The family loves it !! Looking in the Crofton, MD area
Today is Random Acts of Kindness Day. What can you do to make someone's day better? Share your best ideas with us!
I agree with Dan, but have you ever had a PB&J on Roman Meal whole grain? T-t-t-tasty tasty.
Did you know that 95% of Americans don't consume enough whole grains? Like this if you're planning to eat more whole grains in 2011.

Is anyone liking the bonus album better then the Soundtrack? No snubs on Nashville, but i love hearing the actors from the movie singing these songs! Gwyneth, Garrett & Leighten are awesome!
Great movie, strong plot and back story. I was surprised (emotionally) at the many layers of the story and how they were woven together so well. I went out and purchased the soundtrack last night and will definitely purchase the DVD when it comes out. Please continue to make wonderful movies like this that have a 'real' cast and true to life story lines. There's too much CG out there and not enough heart.
watched Pollan & the Veganist on Oprah, and I fully support those that are conscious of what they're eating (& where it came from) no matter how they do it. BUT I have to say I'm confused why vegans don't just avoid meat products as opposed to eating "fake meat" substitutes instead (like tapioca cheese, tofurkey, etc)?? I can't help but think those sound like imitation foods made in a factory somewhere-your thoughts?

is meeting with the principal of my daughter's elementary school tomorrow to discuss nutrition! He has no control over the cafeteria food, but there are oh so many more things to discuss like the school snack list, candy used for classroom activities, junk food given as rewards, school events held at fast food places, etc. I would love to hear of any changes that have successfully been made in your child's school!

New Recipe: Almond Encrusted Fish with (an easy) Buerre Blanc Sauce http://www.100daysofrealfood.com/2011/02/10/recipe-almond-encrusted-fish-with-an-easy-buerre-blanc-sauce/
I found a way to connect with a few folks in my community. I live in rural Alabama. our local mega-lo-mart is the closest thing to fresh produce with the exception of over priced fruit stands. Most of the people I interact with have no idea what real food is. I have been educating in my own small way. When someone is talking about a food product, like Doritos, I agree with them. "Yes, those are good, too bad they aren't real food." Or I'll share. "yep, my husband was in charge of cooking the other night I wish he understood that deep fried french fries are not a vegetable." A light bulb actually goes off in their heads, I can see it. I wish it worked 100% of the time. Later, I make a point to talk about how exciting it is to go to the u-pick farms that are close by. Two people are planning family trips this summer to the local u-picks. I think your blog has helped me tremendously in making food choices for my family. Thank you so much for publishing it. ~Amber 
Has anyone in the Western states (except CA, sorry!) tried the food co-op Bountiful Baskets? I'm getting my first order of fruits and veggies on Saturday and I have never been so excited. Now what to do with 38 pounds of oranges....
I remembered something on your website about making your own flour. How do you do it? Do you use a grain mill? 
Any "Real Food" people in the Charlotte NC area can use GO Local NC Farms, LLC and have access to tons of local meat and produce ... put together and available at several pick-up locations for good prices!!! Carolyn is awesome and the quality and taste of the meat is superb! They make it super easy and convenient to stay local!
planted some seeds in our garden yesterday including broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, sugar snap peas, bibb lettuce, carrots, pak choi, and green onions. Who else is doing a late winter/early spring planting this year? It is my first time trying to grow everything from seed so wish me luck! :)
is going to take my girls for donuts this morning...yes, just regular old dunkin donuts since treats should be allowed in moderation! But don't think I didn't fill them up as much as I could first with a berry/spinach smoothie, homemade granola, and some fruit! They actually loved their breakfast at home, but are equally excited about our little outing :)
I was just looking for 100% Whole Wheat biscuit recipes and found your site. How exciting. I, all by myself and pretty ignorant of what I was doing, decided to give up processed food for my New Year Resolution. There's no going back now. :)
was going to make stuffed shells tonight until I discovered that Earth Fare does not sell whole-wheat jumbo shells! So now I either need to turn the dish into a lasagna, toss it all together with rigatoni, attempt to make some shells, or come up with a whole new dinner plan. An unexpected change in plans is not my favorite thing...
let's talk about this whole husband thing...I am hearing from more and more women who cannot convince their husbands to switch to real food! Who is dealing with this issue, and who has had some success converting their significant other??
Real Foodies, I would like some simple, quick salad dressing recipes, please. Like a nice honey mustard and a balsamic vinegarette or any other favorites! Thank you in advance!
resposting question from Laura - "Real Foodies, I would like some simple, quick salad dressing recipes, please. Like a nice honey mustard and a balsamic vinegarette or any other favorites! Thank you in advance!"
Any advice on handling eating out/dinner invitations? I really want to reduce the amount of unhealthy food we eat and am doing alright cooking at home. However, life doesn't normally go as I plan at the start of the week. This week alone my dinner plans on Sunday were thwarted by DH wanting to take the girls for sushi, last night thwarted by my mom wanting us to eat at her house before she leaves for at trip. Not only do we end up eating stuff I'd rather we didn't (sushi was ok, but mom's house not so much!) but the groceries I buy end up going bad. I don't want to throw in the towel but man, I'm so frustrated!!! 
who knew that homemade chicken salad (with pecans) and goat cheese on crackers would be the bomb. What are you having for lunch today?
If someone was starting this, what would be your suggestion on where to start? I have read through your entire blog and have lots of notes but what was your actual first step? Throwing processed out or adding unprocessed? Just curious. 
I just saw in the February Eating Well magazine a blurb about your family and the challenge- great idea. I really like the idea of making the chicken stock in the crockpot after you have made a meal in it. I make my own stock all the time and freeze it but never thought of letting the crockpot do the work for me. THANK YOU. God Bless you and your family.
just got a bread maker!! I am so excited I can hardly stand it....I have no idea why I waited this long to get one. I know a lot of you tell me I could easily make bread without one, but something about just throwing in the ingredients and turning it on is so tempting!
is thrilled that so many people are coming out for my Earth Fare event in Ballantyne tomorrow night! I can't wait to chat with everyone about real food. If you didn't get a chance to sign up for this one (the event is now at maximum capacity) no worries just call the store at 704.926.1201 because they are taking names for a future event.

is going to be entertaining twice this weekend, and I am trying to figure out what to cook...what is your go-to meal for guests??
admits it - I am nosey. When volunteering in my daughter's kindergarten class today I couldn't help but notice what some of the kids brought in for their morning (9:00 A.M. snack). One had chocolate covered donuts and another had a rice krispie treat. What happened to at least eating a decent meal before getting the junk? What do you send in for your child's morning snack???

Oh, the fun we had at the Festival. We're back in cold and rainy New York City, but with sun in our hearts. Thank you Lee!
Happy Humpday from your friends at Willie T's! It's a beautiful day for sampling the best mojitos in Key West.... Come see us at 525 Duval Street, and have a great day!
It's a beatiful Sunday in Key West! Come on down to see us on Duval Street, and bring your sweetheart... we wish all of our friends near and far a happy Valentine's Day!
Valentine's Day is less than a week away...what are you hoping to get? Chocolates? Flowers??
The correct total answer is 52 The varieties are Hershey, Kit Kat, Reeses, Take 5, Caramello and Hershey with Almonds. Not to mention we also have Pies, Cookie Dough, Cheesecakes and Cini-Minis available as a choice of fundraising product! Yumm!
Hope everyone is staying warm today and has stocked up on their hot chocolate supply!
Kiwi is the correct answer. As part of a marketing setup, the name was changed to sound more appealing to potential customers. Also known as, Yang Tao. So, would you buy a fruit that was called Chinese Gooseberry???
So, instead of heading to your favorite MaineSource location and picking up your usual Pepsi or Coke products, what if you could buy Tofurky & Gravy soda or even Sweet Potato flavor? Tell us, would you be interested in taking a sip of these Thanksgiving themed drinks?
Have you seen the new Cini-Minis item available for fundraising?? Six mini cinnamon rolls perfect for anyone on the go in the morning. Does anyone know what percentage of Americans eat sweets, such as Cini-Minis for breakfast on a daily basis?
This fruit was originally called Chinese Gooseberry from Northern China...what is this fruit and why did the name change?
It is definitely hard to stump you all. Those who guessed (most of you) potato in 1995 are correct! :)
Everyone loves their snack foods...chips, nachos, pretzels and cheese, we could go on forever! So, True or False...the first flavor potato chip ever developed was Sour Cream and Onion. What do you think??
Who is in the mood for ice cream sundaes? Today's answer is Walnut Sauce Topping. Delicious on all desserts.
Good Morning Everyone! It's time to guess the Mystery Item...changin it up a little! Good Luck!
looks like walnuts!
Looks like caramel corn
I have a question about berries. I am looking for these to even if they are in jam or jelly form it doesnt bother me Lingonberries and gooseberries. I would perfer the gooseberries be in berry form but can still use it as a jam form
Yesterday I bought an entire 11.85 pound sirloin tip at MaineSource. The yield: one 2-pound roast, six 6-ounce steaks, 2 pounds of cubes for stew, and 3 pounds lof lean ground beef. Average net cost: $3.05 per pound. 
does anyone know what time Mainesource opens on Front. St. Binghamton??
What are your plans for this Valentines Day? Don't forget to check out our weekly flyer...How about some Bay Harbor Lobster Tails for dinner?
And the correct answer is....Cheese & Onion followed by Salt & Vinegar.
I would like to see MaineSource distribute Glazier products from Malone, NY. They have excellent hot dogs, pickled sausage & eggs. 
Today is National Almond Day! So go nutty everyone!
Its Friday and also National Drink Wine Day! That doesnt mean you cant cook with it though! So, tell us what are your favorite wine dishes???
So, we know Summer barbequing seems pretty far away since we can't escape this winter wonderland yet. But, this weeks Chef Tip is just that...When barbecuing, use tongs to turn the meat. A fork should never be used, it will punch holes in the flesh and allow the natural juices to escape and loose flavor and become chewy.
Trying to keep our hopes up that Spring and Summer are not too far away...A Tuesday Trivia question... Sweet and spicy flavors, such as brown sugar and horseradish make up what type of sauce for barbequing?
If we got you in the mood for some of your grilling favorites, see our specials this week... Fresh Boneless Chicken Tenderloins $1.79/LB or Sirloin Tip $2.70/LB.
Have you been to our Binghamton location yet? If so, what is your favorite item or department?
The meat dept. is my fav! Quality is excellent and price is far better than any other store in the area. Tom, Dave and the rest are always very helpful. Come to think f it, the entire staff there terrific!
A report this week says that 65% of students relay on school lunches as their only meal of the day. Many are even coming into school without either meals, making it harder for them to learn and teachers having to feed students during class. What do you think about these statements?
MaineSource Chef Tip - How do you like your pancakes? Light and fluffy? If so, instead of milk, substitute with club soda in batter mix for your perfect pancake.
Hope all our fans try out our Chef Tip of the week. Any of your own favorite tips to share?
This is National Nutella Day! Have you ever tried it?

You have probably noticed that we have "ORGANIC" and "GLUTEN FREE" tags on items in stores...What other(s) would you like to see? Here are some options: Low Sodium, Heart Healthy, Good for Kids, Good for Diabetics, Low Carbohydrate, Casein/Dairy Free, High Fiber....and any that you would suggest?

Have you checked your INBOX for your Advantage (e)Mail? What are "your favorites" that are on sale this week?
FYI - to be "low sodium" an item has to be less than or = to 140mg of sodium/serving. If you are eating something that could be considered a whole meal like a soup/stew or frozen meal then keeping the sodium to less than 500mg would be advisable.

Another "new item" favorite ....Sparkling, low in calories, great flavor - and on sale this week!

The largest study of its kind has unexpectedly concluded that even very heavy, long-term cannabis users who had smoked more than 22,000 joints over a lifetime, a UCLA study clinical study confirms they "do not have any increase risk of cancer.

I have a question: My family has only consumed Organic milk for years and years, about 10 or so. For a few years now, all of us but one, drinks Rice Milk.

Just wondering if anyone can explain the hype around colloidal silver, gold and platinum? I can't seem to find anything on the internet about it except information from the suppliers who sell the supplement. Is it essential to health and can you get it naturally from food?
Your movie was very inspiring and has caused a change in me. Thank you for putting this movie together. I am telling everyone I know about it :)
Just saw FoodMatters. I hope more watch it. I agree with many of the points about food and medical drugs but I wish the documentary touched a bit on why the medical field chose to profit drug companies to sell drugs to consumers, rather than profiting farmers to sell food to consumers. Thinking for myself, it can be because drugs are more addicting than food and drug companies can probably offer more money than farmers.
It reverts back to another thing people lack, common sense... But Big Business has everyone brain washed through advertizing, people think that ordering a pizza and some wings on a Friday night is treating your family right. And I've gotta admit I fall right into it, I do it, and as I'm pigging out and going for another slice the common sense kicks in, and I know it's wrong.... But it's our culture and it needs to change... Thank you for making the movie, I enjoyed it immensely.
I just watched this. Thank u <3

Janice's sister Denise brought her famous artichoke dip to her house for a dinner party. Says she decreased the mayo and uppped the Cheddar cheese to make it 'heatlhier'! What do you think? How do you tweak your family favorites to make them healthier?
We made the Tomato soup recipe you posted to your blog from Podcast #132. We used half and half instead of the whipping cream. It was really good, very flavorful. We're happy to have this over canned tomato soup anyday. Thanks for sharing!
made your hearty beef and bean hamburgers (with sweet potato fries on the side) from your book last night. my husbands initial response: "these are so tender and juicy!" then: "what is that, a bean!?! are you trying to kill me!" in the end he begrudgingly agreed that the burgers, though healthy, had great presentation, great taste, and i could make them again. a win for sure!
I love using canned beans but am trying to watch the salt - how much does rinsing them help? Have you found any brands that are lower in salt? And a crazy idea - can you precook a big batch ahead and freeze them??
so your chicken pot pie bundles taste just as good unbundled and in a bowl over rice ... despite what tha book says I bought little wonton wrappers by mistake.

So my daughter said "really?? what book is it from??" and told her she couldn't have tried it because her mom didn't cook from your book!

Quick questions, will adding baking soda to dishes with tomatoes/tomatoe sauce change the nutrients in the dish? I have to reduce my acid intake so the baking soda helps in these kids of dishes. 
Hi Janice and Liz! I have been listening for a while (you guys are so much fun) and just wanted to tell you that I recently purchased both your books and the 7-Day meal planner that you reviewed and I can't wait to make some of your delicious nutricious recipes! Keep up the great work!
Chicken and Sweet Potato Enchilada Casserole is in the crock-pot. It's making the house smell so good on this rain/ice day here on the South Shore of Boston. Thank you!
Just finished making TraderJoes Banana Muffins with flax meal, canola oil and avocado. They turned out great, thanks for the healthy tips. My kids love them.
Tried the Luau Chicken slow cocker recipe last night! Another winner!
Woo hoo! Layers of Love Ravioli Lasagna receives TWO THUMBS UP from Anna & Sam! Chard and all. I'm so happy! Thank you, ladies! :o)
I need a good Valentine treat for my 4 year old to bring to school. I don't want to do candy and I can't bring anything with peanuts and I need 2 dozen. Any suggestions for something kind of healthy but something the kids will like?
Last week we tried the Cauliflower and leeks recipe. It was so good! It made me want to eat cauliflower every week. I got a pressure cooker for Christmas so I could make brown rice in it instead of making instant all the time. Saturday we finally used it for the first time and tired out the Butternut Squash risotto. It came out great! We like to make risotto but it's a weekend only meal when we have enough time to make it. Now we have some options. Also made the Fudgy Black Bean Brownies last night. They were delicious and moist. I was a little concerned but did keep an open mind. The smell of black beans really turns my stomach but I had faith I wouldn't taste them in the end (I did puree them probably a little more than I needed, just to be on the safe side!). It was the first time my daughter had a brownie and boy did she love it! Thanks for all the great recipes, we are really enjoying them.
I am making your cupcakes for MOMS group tomorrow...while listening to you:) I love podcasts! 
Help! I get a monthly CSA farm box and I have turnips and rutabagas to eat up. Any good recipes you can suggest? I add them to soups when I can, but I'm running out of ideas.
The cupcakes were a HUGE hit ladies. Plus, everyone loved that they had extra antioxidants. I even got to talk about cocoa and blueberries:)
Dear Janice, dear Liz! I'm from Germany and I have one short question. For me as a German Cupcakes and Muffins were always the same. Now I heart in you last podcast episode there must be a significant difference, would you mind explaining the difference for me. BTW ... the cupcake you mentioned during the last episode look were delecious and I will make them next Sunday. Thanks for you great work, Daniela
Look what Liz's husband got her for Valentine's Day: A 1.5 pound chocolate stiletto shoe! Can anyone top that?
A couple of 7 year-olds are gobbling up brownie banana waffles! I did put them in the toaster over after they were cooked (the waffles, not the kids); they were not very crisp. Did I do something wrong?
Any good quinoa recipes for very picky eater?
I'm making "Mom, the house smells great" chicken right now. . .and my daughter just walked up from the basement and said "Mom, the house smells great!" Just thought you should know =)
Ladies, one more question about the quinoa breakfast cereal. Do you think its okay to make a large batch one day and then serve it the next morning or two. Mornings are not prime time for cooking around here.
I was referred to your website by my nutritionist because I needed help with finding healthy recipes for my family. I made several recipes off the web they were a hit. I just bought the book and was happy to read how much the recipes were tested. I have bought other cookbooks that it was obvious the recipes were not tested well. I'm looking forward to trying more recipes. PS: Made the berry good chocolate cupcakes and they were yummy. 
I attended your demo at MVRCS last night. It was wonderful & extremely helpful. As suggested, I had a plate of cut up fruit on the table when the boys came down for breakfast. Before I had their lunches made, the plate of fruit was empty. Couple of serving down the hatch before they left for school!!! Wonderful & thanks.. Will be trying the smoothies tomorrow..
Attempting to make the Sweet Turkey and Quinoa meatballs tonight but feels like one of the Worst Cooks in America. I cooked the turkey before mixing all the ingrediants (I cooked the quinoa so I guess I though I needed to cook that too)!!! So, suggestions on how to salvage the mix? It doesn't form into balls anymore. I think I'd like to put it into a med. cassarole dish to cook, what to top it with?
My friend just told me about Quinoa that is sold at Costco in a large bag and it doesn't need to be pre-rinsed. I think the brand is Nature's Delight or Earth's Delight. something like that. My bag said it needed pre-rinsing but I spoke with the company and they said that it isn't necessary. Going to use it tonight.
Where do I find the egg roll wraps to make the mini chicken pot pies? Do they freeze well? I just made the pumpkin/chocolate chip muffins and they were a hit. We made the mini meatloaf the other night and 1 out of 2 kids liked it and my husband too, so we'll add that to our list.
enjoying your cookbook! made the granola tonight for the week ahead. I couldn't find light olivio so had to go with the regular but I don't use it often, sometimes on toast when I don't use almond butter! Kids are gone but your cookbooks are still on duty- why change a good thing? Thanks so much!
just wanted to tell you I'm turning over a new leaf and trying the menu planning thing- on week 2 of meals all from your book. so far, so good. my son has loved everything, my older daughter some stuff and my younger daughter refuses to try anything. but hey- i'm persevering! and i'd love an iphone app but can you make it not depend on the internet because i have an ipod touch and it's not always in wifi..
chicken broccoli crunch in the oven right now..
Chocolate pumpkin squares were a hit in this house!!! Thanks for the great recipe. 
tuscan minestrone soup tonight.. came out great. I added some sliced ham to make it a more substantial dinner soup. 1 "best meal of the week" 1 "mom I like it I think" and 1 "yucky". I'd say that's a winner in my book. I also ordered your old book from amazon yesterday. Looking forward to even more recipies!
I just want to say I just started listening to you guys this morning. I had downloaded some podcasts from itunes. This morning my son and I were traveling so I decided to listen to you. You have such great ideas! I actually had never even listened to a podcast before so this is all new to me. I have to say you two made my trip go by alot faster. I am a mom to 2 wonderful boys ages 5 & 2. My 5 year old loves his fruit and veggies. My 2 year old is the tricky one he will not eat his veggies or his fruit. During the day I am also the cook/kitchen manager at a daycare & preschool. So not only will I use you tips at home I will also be using them at work. So thank you! I think you both are great!
Being the romantic guy that I am I wanted to do something for my wife for Valentine's Day. She doesn't like flowers though and buying chocolates is too easy so I made her some cupcakes instead. Heart-shaped meatloaf cupcakes that is!
Spaghetti and meatball pizza!
When you find a McDonald's that serves pancakes and breakfast burritos all day long the only logical thing to do is to create a new sandwich that combines those with their regular lunch menu.

Frustrating experience at 67th Ave. Ind. Sch store. Long wait whenever I do a price check. Tonight called about 11:20p took 2 calls and 28 mins to find out the price of Dole fruit crisp and Pineapple chunks. I think that is an unreasonable wait even at peak times. Don't feel very appreciated as a customer.
Dear Fry's maybe you can help. I emailed and left a message for the VIP department but so far no response. The deli tray coupon I loaded yesterday for up to $12 off... it did not come off when the Deli Department rang it up... so they told me to come back and we would try to do it again when I pick it up Friday.. is there something special they need to do? thank you!
Frys I <3 you! Thank you SO MUCH for sending me that beautiful envelope with pink roses on the outside with all those WONDERFUL coupons!!!! XOXOXO!!!!!!!!!! You have just made this lady very very Happy!!!! 
well thank you for my Valentines present. 
Frys...need help! I downloaded the coupons for the free deli tray and the free 12 piece bone in chicken wings....when I got them last night they didnt come off my total as a freebee......what am I doing wrong? They are for sure on my card...i printed it out and took it with me...is there a special code the cashier should be using or something else? I really wanted both of these for dinner Sunday!

What type of deli platter do I need to buy to get the FREE deli platter coupon that was loaded to my card to work? I asked at deli and ordered what she told me and it didn't come off. I was accused of using it at another location and trying to use it again. I just left without my platter. I checked my e-coupons and it is still loaded and expires 02/07. The only redeemed coupon I have is the free 12 deli wings. Please help so I can get my platter today before it expires. 800# NO help.
I went to Fry's to get some last minute items I had to get for Superbowl. I decided to do the self checkout because it was crazy in there. There was a person from Fry's who was helping me scan my coupons. She was very nice but forgot to put in my coupon for my free ThermaCare. What should I do? I have my receipt. 
Hi Fry's. I have two questions. Do you have a price accuracy policy? and Do you accept internet coupons printed in black and white? Your coupon policy addresses black and white competitor coupons, so I figure you do, however, I had a proble shopping tonight trying to use internet coupons printed in black and white. Thanks.
Are Fry's Signature prices different from Fry's Stores? I went to get the Wholly guacamole this weekend. It was meant to be on sale for $1.50 and it was on sale for $2.50.... I was going to use my coupon to get it for FREE ($1.50 coupon) Did I miss something? I don't want to have to call a manager for EVERYTHING :(

Dear Yuma friends: You like us and we like you, too. Thank you so much for being kind enough to vote your Yuma team the Friendliest Grocery Checkers, and for considering Frys Yuma the Best Grocery Store. Please tell us in the comments below if youre a Yuma Frys shopper!
I have been a shopper at Fry's #10 in Glendale for over two years. I like the greeters Jay,Joyce and Rachana, they are the best. Also Terry the security guard is the greatest. I am looking forward to seeing the remodeling finished
One other thing that I like to get at my Fry's are the Jenny O Turkey burgers that come in a roll of 12 when will they be back in the case.
Finding the perfect gift for your loved one can be a challenge, but it doesn't have to be. Were here to help, friends. Most stores will have Valentine's Express Tents, starting at 7 a.m. tomorrow (Feb. 12) running through Monday night (Feb. 14). It'll be your one-stop Valentine's shop, with flower arrangements, chocolates, plush stuffed animals and more. Click the "like" button if we'll be seeing you there!
Don't forget to stop by our Valentine's Express Tents this weekend. The hours are: Today and tomorrow (Feb. 12 & 13) from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Monday (Feb. 14) from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. More than 100 stores will have tents, and all stores will have a Valentine's Day display. Word to the wise, friends...Don't procrastinate!
Is there any way the Casa Grande Fry's could get some more cashiers on Saturday morning duty? I went in today and I was the 8th person in line; only one regular line was open. The line grew to 11 shoppers before back-up came. Because the line was so long, it was forced to curve around. That confused some shoppers, who mistakenly cut in line ahead of other people, which just made for crankiness all around. This has been happening for the past few weeks.

Had a nice surprise going into Fry's in Sierra Vista yesterday. It was a party in there! Clown with balloon animals and face painting for my kids, which they thought was awesome! Chocolate fountain going and they were handing out chocolate covered strawberries. And we got serenaded by some karaoke! It was very fun to shop yesterday, always like shopping at that Fry's. :)
Does anyone actually ever win those $100 gift cards when filling out the surveys from your receipt ??? I always fill out the survey, but never hear anything, justa wondering ;)
Just visited a Fred Meyer's in Oregon, why can't we have the same quality and variety of products in the bakery section here at Fry's?? The fruit tarts were absolutely amazing....... I am so disappointed that you have discontinued a Michael Angelo's product, from the frozen food section. It is the Shrimp Alfredo/Fettucini (something to that effect). Would you please bring it back to our local Fry's?
Fry's please work on a new supplier for seafood! I bought three of the lobster tails on special along with a pound of scallops. The lobster had no flavor and the scallops shriveled to nothing. And no, they weren't overcooked! I can make a scallop that would make Gordon Ramsey proud LOL They were full of water. For the price, the quality isn't there.
Morning, As my sister in law and I were going through our Frys bill last night (purchase yesterday) to split the cost of cooking our husbands dinner, we notice we were overcharged on the steaks we purchased. If we have the tags from the meat and the reciept, can we take them in today for a price adjustment? 
Hey NASCAR fans! Right now, until 3 p.m. you can catch the Crown Royal car at the 7th St. & Bell Frys in Phoenix. If you cant make it today, see it tomorrow (Feb. 18) from 3 p.m. 7 p.m. at the 115th Ave & Buckeye Frys in Avondale. If you love NASCAR, like this post.

We just watched Extreme Couponing and a woman shopped at Kroger in Ohio. There was no limitation to the amount of coupons she turned in??? Why is Kroger on t.v. in other states doing this but not having the same policy for all Kroger stores?? Just wondering as this will raise all kinds of questions in the stores after this being shown On T.L.C. They showed shoppers in other stores such as Safeway but you can spot a Kroger store clearly!!!

I have been a loyal shopper at fry's for years now and always bring my reusable bags....today I was informed that fry's will be no longer giving a discount for bringing your own bags in as of march 1st! i just wanted to say how dissapointed i am in this!! with the price of food rising so much, every penny i save counts! lots of other stores are still giving a dicount and I think Fry's should reconsider their decision. I'll still bring my own bags in, but will miss my discount :(
I really, really, really, hope that competitor's coupons and all coupons being worth a $1 never, ever, ever goes away! Just sayin'...

Question on the $3 OYNO Why can we only use one per order? When we buy the Mega items in multiples and receive multiple $3 OYNO we should be allowed to use more than one at a time. Guess I will have to do 20 seperated transactions to be able to use mine up. I did see that Kroger has adjusted this so that customers can use multiple $3 OYNO coupons...hope you guys do the same. 
Can you verify this is correct? I just read this on the Kroger Facebook page concerning the acceptance of the $3 Catalinas received from the Daytona promo: Kroger We are so sorry about the Daytona $3 off printed coupon only working once per transaction. We have worked to resolve this issue by communicating to our stores to allow an override for multiple Daytona $3 off printed coupons in a single transaction, for this event only. Please be assured that we appreciate your feedback and we will use it to improve our promotions going forward. If you have any additional concerns, please call our Customer Service at 1-800-576-4377. Thank you!
Fry's just wanted you to know that I am happy I found your stores. When I moved from my hometown I left behind my favorite King Soopers :( I was here for about 3 months before I found Fry's!! I was surprised by the store when I first went. It was a bonus! Fry's sells home stuff too!! I love the sales and the fact you make all coupons $1. Thanks

I have a question about the Save $3.00 On Your Next Order Catalina Store Coupons. I have seen it posted on coupon blogs that even though it says one per order that you can use multiple of these coupons on one order. The cashier just needs to over ride them at checkout. Can you please verify this for me?

Delaware family enjoys their dream kitchen, compliments of the Ferguson Dream Kitchen Giveaway A new kitchen ranks high on many homeowners dream lists, and Ferguson Bath, Kitchen and Lighting Gallery made those dreams come true for one lucky Delaware family. William and Monica Snowden were selected from more than 1.4 million total entries as the Grand Prize winner of the Ferguson Dream Kitchen Giveaway contest. As you may recall, the Dream Kitchen Giveaway ran on national television during spring 2010, and the winner was announced in June. The Snowdens Dream Kitchen remodel planning process began in the late summer, and construction was completed before the new year. The Snowden family received a kitchen makeover valued at $75,000, featuring KitchenAid Architect Series II suite of appliances, new kitchen cabinets, new kitchen faucet, new kitchen sink, a new garbage disposal, lighting, wall tile and countertops. To help bring it all together, a professional remodeler assisted the Snowdens in designing and creating the kitchen of their dreams. "Our family is excited about our new Dream Kitchen from Ferguson and so grateful that we won, said Monica Snowden. We love our current home, but our kitchen has never been remodeled and is over 30-years-old. When we saw the television commercial advertising the Ferguson Dream Kitchen Giveaway, we immediately went online to find out more about Ferguson and how to enter the giveaway. The family worked closely with associates at Fergusons King of Prussia, Pa., showroom throughout the design and installation process. Sue Ward, formerly Showroom Manager at King of Prussia and now a Business Development Manager in Sacramento, Calif., was instrumental in kitchen cabinet design and orchestrating the overall product selections for the Snowdens Dream Kitchen. Sara Brandon, Outside Showroom Sales Representative, introduced the family to their professional remodeling contractor, Joe Mingioni of Mingioni Construction. Mingioni Construction, based in Edgemont, Pa., has been a good Ferguson customer and is a premier remodeling firm. The company is a Remodeling Big 50 award winner, and Joe Mingioni is actively involved in local and national industry boards and continuing education programs, including those offered by NARI and NAHB.
Virginia Beach shows that healthy cooking starts with Ferguson The Virginia Beach, Va., Showroom hosted a healthy cooking demonstration for associates and customers on Feb. 4, coinciding with American Heart Associations Go Red Day. The corporate chef from Farm Fresh, a local grocer part of the national SuperValu chain, prepared a heart healthy meal of Tuscan Pan Seared Chicken with Radicchio Caprese Salad and Quinoa Pilaf. Farm Fresh donated the food, and generous samples were handed out to everyone in attendance.

I made the goat cheese enchiladas last night -- delicious! I did have a little trouble with the tortillas (some cracked), so if you haven't made them yet, here's a tip: I heated them up in a hot, dry skillet for about twenty seconds before I rolled them up, and that seemed to do the trick. Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch.
Kale and Blue Cheese risotto! Never had Kale before - delicious - Love that Green in my risotto. One more selling pt of the Meez is that the separated ingredients allow allergy-sad lads (like myself - who bite dust at the taste of walnuts) to enjoy lovely gormet meals.... loved it.
Tell us about your favorite Meez Meal for a chance to win a free week! It's easy. Just write about your favorite on our wall, and we'll select a winner at random. (Here's the fine print: the winning entry will be chosen on March 4 from all of the submissions. The free week is for three two-serving meals. No more than 5 entries per person, please. No purchase necessary. Email us for details.)
So far, my favorite has been the cheese enchiladas. I've never cooked with tomatillos, so I liked giving that a try, and the sauce was delicious! So easy and soooo tasty.
I'm eating it now... The tahini bowl. I could eat this for breakfast. So good. 
My fave (so far): Red-Wine Braised Lentils with Kale and Polenta. So delicious, and very elegant -- I would even serve this at a dinner party. I hope we see it on the menu again soon!
Soft Polenta with Cherry Tomato & Kale Ragout although the Tuscan stew with kale and olives is a close 2nd! Kale is my new favorite food!
So far, my favorite has been the penne pasta with winter pesto and cannelini beans. First of all, it was creamy pasta which I looove because it was so comforting but also really good for you! Second, I never ever cook with kale and I've never made pesto so I got two really great new tricks from this recipe. After eating that, we started ordering more meez meals with kale and have even started buying it on our own and plan to grow it in our garden this summer. Love it!
My fav was the sweet potato tacos - I never would have thought of making tacos without meat, but they were awesome!
Some members have asked what makes our tofu so good. We buy it from Phoenix Bean Products, a small, local company based in Edgewater. Its made in small batches using GMO-free soybeans. Give it a try this week in our a Mediterranean-inspired lemony sauce, served with broccoli raab. Its super quick and super delicious.
It's Blizzard 2011 outside, and we have just the things to keep you warm as you clean up next week: Grown Up Mac & Cheese. Cheesy Spinach Burritos. Butternut Squash Curry and more. Check them out at www.meezmeals.com and get your order in by Thursday. Stay warm!
Cauliflower tofu. It was our first Meez meal. 
Polenta with kale and tomatoes. I once ate it for lunch and dinner in the same day. So good. 
My favorite is now the chickpea tacos with cilantro rice and avocado. It was surprisingly filling and really delicious. Excellent with a dash of Tabasco sauce. Definitely bring that one back! 
Our favorite was the tahini bowl- would have never thought it could be so delicious! 
One of the best things about cooking with Meez is discovering new ways to prepare familiar ingredients. We do it this week with gnocchi. Instead of boiling them, weve discovered pan frying. They get a crispy-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside texture that we cant get enough of. Were cooking them this week with lemony kale. Check out all of this weeks menu items at www.meezmeals.com.

We're visualizing sun, but rain or shine you still gotta eat. Pull on those wellies and meet us at the Little Italy farmers' market tomorrow!
Nothing like a little moisture to make the mushrooms grow! Mello Mushroom will have beautiful chanterelles at the Little Italy farmers' market today. Mmmm, mushroom soup!
These aren't your ordinary supermarket avocados. Our farmers have a variety for every taste.
Get right to the heart of things in Little Italy tomorrow.
It's Chinese New Year! Welcome the Year of the Rabbit by hopping down to the Mercato for mandarins and pomelos to bring positive energy and prosperity to your household.
Want to add fresh oysters to your Valentine's Day menu, but not sure how to open the little shuckers? Poppa's Fresh Fish can help.
If it looks like a duck, and cracks like a duck, maybe you should make an omelet! Get them fresh at tomorrow's market!
Coffee brewing and Organic Mary's chickens on the roto at Dos Roti this morning. The Little Italy farmers' market smells good!
It's almost Valentine's Day! Flowers, check. Chocolates, check. Asparagus, oysters and other assorted aphrodisiacs, check. It's all at the Mercato tomorrow!
Who likes the new Facebook biz pages, where posts are weighted instead of chronological? Not so much? Me neither. :-p

Burning DVD of yogurt lesson for @WardehHarmon 's Cultured Dairy eCourse. My FAVorite thing to teach! 
Getting ready for a grain mill head-to-head with my friend this afternoon...as long as she's not going into labor! (Due date was Sunday...) Should be a fun vlog for next week's Nutrimill week! :)
Mon: It's Nutrimill week! The giveaway opens officially on FRIDAY you can't enter until then but watch Facebook next week for random extra entry opportunities!
20% off paperback copies of Keeper of the Home 's Real Food on a Real Budget and Healthy Homemaking with code HAPPYCA305. The perfect way to make an eBook a gift - I'm thinking bridal shower excellence...
Oh, my poor sick girl. 32 hours after the last throw up, you figure you're out of the woods. Not this one. We're back on the bucket brigade. :( Ready for some relief and a nap!
What makes you shake your head when you see it happen in our culture? I do it constantly: with risque clothing & actions, carts full of Little Debbie and soda (we call it pop), and especially parents who side with their kids' bad behavior instead of the teacher's good discipline.
Oh, my gracious. Homemade peppermint patties w/dark chocolate and sucanat? Seriously. Might have to make these for Valentine's Day! I wasn't planning anything at all special. Am I missing the boat or just skipping a Hallmark card holiday?
Anyone interested in videotaping their family taking fermented cod liver oil for a fun post at KS? If you can upload it to You Tube, I can include it. This is my husband's idea for something a little silly, because as he pops his FCLO capsules he laughs at the faces the rest of us make when we swallow ours!
Aimee of Simple Bites, with whom I was blessed to spend time at Blissdom, has posted an important and inspiring post today on sharing meals with others. It's something my community of mothers does regularly - do you? She's also sharing a round-up of good travel-able sympathy meals Sunday. I'm trying to decide what link to send her...
24 hours exactly. Can't believe it. 2yo woke up at 5 a.m. after still having a number of dry heaves throughout the night and was *screaming mad* that she couldn't eat a banana and guzzle water from her water bottle! So happy she's healthy/on the mend (although I could have done without the nearly 2-hour fit/fight in the middle of the night, thank you!). Thank you ALL for all your prayers!
We did it! Wondermill vs. Nutrimill head to head. One was faster by a longshot, the other might have the advantage on fineness of grind, but that was pretty doggone subjective. One definitely made a bigger mess than the other. Watch next week for the results, goofy video, and the Nutrimill giveaway!
My poor little one has been throwing up every 10 minutes since 5 a.m. :( Please pray for some relief for her and protection from this bug for the rest of the family. Poor girl, she says she's "starving" and wants an apple. No can do...
Figures - the in-laws forgot to use the raw milk this morning, even though the kids had cereal. Yucky skim milk. Ah, well - at least my son had echinacea for his cold and a bit of yogurt!
Totally impressed with this gluten-free, GAPS friendly cake from Modern Alternative Mama. I'm a believer in the black bean brownies, but this one almost sounds too good to be true! 
Dinner tonight was the final test for Tuscan Bean Soup, going in the Everything Beans Book. Doubled it for a friend who had a baby last week, and of course I neglected to double the beans. It was still good, and I fixed it before packaging it up for her! ;)
Random Question: I see that people recommend keeping their veggie scraps for stock. How does that work?? Don't things like onion tops and carrot tops/peels have dirt in them? And the thin papery part of the onion peel--does it matter if that goes in there as part of the top? Do you just wash them well before you freeze them? But then I would think that would lead to a solid frozen lump in the freezer. 
Monday Mission: Try Organ Meats
Well, I sent the kiddos off with a quart of raw milk, a quart of yogurt, butter, CLO, maple syrup, ww bread...They'll be at the in-laws' house 20 hours. Um. Did I overdo it? http://www.kitchenstewardship.com/2011/02/03/everybodys-afraid-of-something/

Nutrimill vs. Wondermill Grain Mill: the Head-to-Head Challenge (VLOG)
Seeking the Perfect Homemade Whole Wheat: Tammys 100% Whole Wheat Bread (no. 6)
Grabbed what I thought was a whole chicken at Farmer's Market Saturday - farmer sd, "Oh no, you don't want that, that's just leftover parts for stock or whatever." I of course replied, "Great, then I'll take this plus a whole chicken!" Roast chix Sunday dinner, stock going all night in the big ol' post, and delish chix noodle today. (Plus the potential winner of the bread series!)
Name That Grain! (What are all Those Kinds of Wheat For???)
I'm attempting a flexitarian (dietary) choice out of preference and an opportunity to ensure great health. I'm trying to add more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into myself, my family, and my love's lives easily and tastily as possible. I googled "how to make whole wheat tortillas" and am looking very much forward to making your versions. I do have to say that I love white flour breads although I recently discovered that whole white wheat flour added in varying amounts will up the whole factor yet keep the lighter color I prefer. Thank You for your devotion to the creation of this recipe. I'll post again with my feedback. Best to you! 
Just got a code in my email for $20 off the Get Cultured fermented foods course - use SOURPICKLES thru Monday! http://nourishedkitchen.com/ecourse/ferment-anything/?AFFID=35552 Grab a chance to win it, too, at KS this week! http://bit.ly/fFfKYr
Katie, I'm wondering about the dosing on FCLO. I just bought my 1st jar and the serving size listed is 2 ML, which less than a 1/2 tsp. I just read your interview w/ Dave from GP and he says to take about 1/2 tsp. I read some of the links you had posted in another post and that lady said to take a 1 1/3 tsp for adults! What's "right"? 
My 5yo son asks me, Can the baby [in your belly] taste food yet? He then coaches me, Then the baby gets all the bad parts of sugar that make him feel bad, but not the good parts that taste good. You should not eat any more sugar until the baby comes out, Mom. !!!!
Reverse engineered a recipe with Stove Top Stuffing on top for the next KS eBook "Healthy Meal Transformations." DH said, "What's this on top?" I cringed and paused. He sd, "Because it's really, really good." (Phew!) Success! 5yo DS sd, "I don't see how anyone couldn't like this!" Very excited. One pot meal, too!
Well, if I didn't believe it before, now I'm convinced that NaturOli soapnuts do the trick. After I-lost-count-how-many loads of throw-up laundry the past week, nothing smells remotely icky. A new stamp of commendation for the little guys. :) http://ow.ly/3Y0bG
First bonus entries for the Nutrimill giveaway will be in the top box of the blog this evening and through the weekend! Don't forget to check Facebook daily for the 5 weekdays next week - a bonus 5 entries will be available every day! :)

I just found your website when searching for sourdough recipes... thanks for all the great info! ~Blessings!
Trying to use my desk to work on formatting the beans book today, since I can't use my real mouse on the couch. I could hardly get there b/c of the mess we made working on packing up 1/2 our house to "stage" it to sell yesterday! Stress. Level. Rising. !!!

Who knows my story? In front of what section at the grocery store did I freak out because I didn't know what to buy when I first started understanding traditional foods? 4th CORRECT answer in the comments here gets five extra grain mill entries!
My husband had something to share with me about this eating the whole chicken thing. He doesn't like dark meat. He's a bit upset that I snuck in organ meats. I was just trying to complete my own mission from a few weeks ago! (At least the kids don't notice...)
Finally made the latest bread recipe that's been in the queue since last Wednesday. I could almost eat it w/o butter, it's so good (almost!). Uses two ingredients that haven't shown up even once in all the other recipes (nor any bread I've ever made) - can't wait to share on Tuesday!

I love your whole wheat bread recipe. It is so easy to make with my Kitchenaid mixer and it comes out perfect every time!
Just wanted to say thanks. I made your "larabar-like" recipe this afternoon. We've been on the full GAPS diet for almost two months. My husband has been a champ with all these new foods. When I gave him a sample of the Basic Bar and the Sunny Vacation, his eyes bugged out. "This is AWESOME! This is really REALLY good! I'd eat this again." I've really loved your Healthy Snacks to Go ebook. Since going GAPS, finding snacks has been a challenge. Thanks for the save!
So happy to have frozen Hearty Lentil Stew tonight; all I had to prepare were baked potatoes and steamed broccoli. This jar was one of 3 leftovers from one batch of the stew! A frugal meal that stretches far...look for it in the ebook tomorrow (hopefully!).
Also pretty happy to be part of the GNOWFGLINS eCourse, since this month's new Thank You video is how to season cast iron properly. I've read about it but never done it - maybe seeing it in person will give me the push I need so I can stop scraping scrambled eggs off the skillet flake by flake! Check out the eCourses here: http://www.gnowfglins.com/ecourse/153.html
Hmmmmm...what "healthy snack" should I bring for a kindergarten Valentine's Day party? Too low on honey to make my first thought, granola bars. Do I go fruits or veggies, homemade crackers and cheese, or something else?

The good news is that we are getting to the bottom of the infamous pile of donations at Good Cheer's distribution center. It is very uncommmon to to see the floor and the second door that leads to the administrative office. The bad news is that we need your item donations as that is the food for our Thrift Stores. PLEASE consider donating the items you just NEVER use as someone out there just might be looking for the item you no longer need but they do.
Beautiful day ~ Cary & her volunteers are busy in garden. Garvel is being placed and spread making the floor for our new greenhouse, soil is being sifted in the hoop house, and we are making plans in getting energy to the shed and greenhouse ~ solar being a STRONG possibility.

Yay I'm a winner! Only problem is I live in Byron Bay Australia so I don't imagine you'll be sending me one of your beautiful cheesecakes, damn. Please donate to a worthy and hungry cause ( or maybe Patricia could get both?) and thank you so much. I think rockin' raspberry would be my choice, mmmm xx
Just tried the Coconut Carob Cream Pie for the first time - WOW! Great work! 
thank you so much for the cheesecake, I tried to save it for Valentine's Day but hubby couldn't resist, delicious!
I purchased your cheesecakes thru the gathergreen that was offered recently-when and how will I receive my coupons to purchase?
A few Thursday thoughts; try filling your thoughts with words that make you feel happy, strong & in control of your life. Be mindful to use words that evoke confidence & success. Make a sincere effort to focus on these words rather than those that make you feel like you're incompetent or failing. Word selection is key to achieving your maximum overall life success...
Be conscious of those people that you're thankful & grateful to have in your life. Never take them for granted or have them feel less than important. Adopting an attitude of appreciation towards the things in your life makes an enormous difference to your level of happiness. People who attempt to be thankful & appreciative feel happier & more at peace to a much greater extent...
I know, not the most glamorous but I want everyone drinking their water. Muscles are made mostly of water. Increasing water intake will help prevent muscle cramping, improve the strength of muscle contractions, quicken muscle response & improve muscle tone. Preventing dehydration will also help prevent sagging skin, since water will fill out the muscles, resulting in clear, healthy & resilient skin. So, drink up.:).
Here are the details for our much anticipated, The Oscars Contest.:). We will award 3 of our GF, raw & dairy free cheesecakes to the 1st 3 people that successfully pick the Winners of all 5 of the following categories: Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress & Best Movie. The Oscars are Feb 27th, cut-off time to enter the Contest is Feb. 27th at 4:30 pm (PST). Study up & Good Luck!
It's not the right of another to make a person feel unworthy. Shame on those who belittle, intimidate or try to put others down. Being nice to others doesn't cost a dime. However, the price of being mean spirited could cost a fortune. Many of those considered unkind are also the most fearful, the most insecure. Be in the company of those that are kind & good-hearted. Do your best to detach from the Negative Willies.
Be brave about change. Change is the inevitable & often times you don't notice that it's happening. Embrace it with excited anticipation. During challenging times, you're likely to be more sensitive to changes that are taking place. View change as new chapter in your life, a great new adventure. You'll never know what you can discover & learn until you're open to change & future possibilities...
Display an attitude of compassion & understanding. Understand where the other person is coming from & sense what it must be like going through what they are going through. Learn to want to ease their suffering. Whenever the opportunity is upon you, make the effort to come to their assistance in any fashion that you feel is appropriate...
Just wanted you to know I enjoy your posts! I keep finding myself coming back here for the positivity. And then of course the drool-worthy pictures don't hurt! <3 xxo Eva
The foundation of a positive, healthy relationship is loving & respecting your partner. Show your love in both your words & actions, in all that you say & do. The expression, 'actions speak louder than words,' definitely holds true when it comes to a relationship. Be generous with your compliments & mean what you say. This will help give the other person the opportunity of doing the same...
Enjoyed my Strawberry Fields Forever Cheesecake, thank-you!! :) 
Yep, tonight is our The Oscars Contest. Here's a recap on the details...

Develop an attitude to be able to tell yourself that 'yes you can'. It's important to have confidence & believe in yourself. Have confidence in your ability. Events in your life might not always go exactly per plan, some people may let you down & others not offer you the support you deserve. Having confidence in yourself will help you achieve your goals & face more confidently whatever challenges come your way...
With that Steelers touchdown and a score of 28-25, Packers... Judy Adams takes over the Top Spot with her score of 28-27, Packers. Judy Adams knocks off Bill Kolb for the Top Spot...
You are what you think. Self-talk, the auto-thoughts that run consistently in your head, are powerful & may be either positive or negative. Some of these thoughts originate from logic & reason, others from misconceptions due to a lack of information. If your thoughts are mostly negative, shut it down for your outlook is likely pessimistic. Keep your thoughts constructive, this is a key component to positive thinking.
That's a wrap, Packers WIN...31-25. Viv Steedman & Patricia Conary are our WINNERS & each will get half a cheesecake. I couldn't resist. Each lady will receive 1 of our Gluten & dairy free cheesecakes of their choice. Nicely done ladies!! Please reach out to us with shipping info & flavor selection...
Vow to show how you care by frequently doing nice things for your partner. It's an appreciated way to show you care. Listen, pay attention to what your partner has to say, show the level of interest that you would like for them to show you. Be a positive influence, be supportive & communicate. Don't hold grudges, many things in the past are best left in the past. Love freely, completely. And remain committed, always.
That Packers Field Goal makes the score 31-25, Packers... Viv Steedman & Patricia Conary take over the Top Spot with scores of 31-24, Packers. The ladies knock off Judy Adams to share Top Spot honors...
Self-awareness allows you a choice as to how to act when you're feeling intense emotion. Be mindful when you feel anger taking hold. Make it a habit of trying to place yourself in the shoes of the other person. Really try to understand what it's like to be them. Pick understanding, compassion, not violence as a means to an end. Always work to keep your cool in the heat of the moment...
Undecided about what to get your Sweetheart (or maybe yourself) for Valentine's Day? Perhaps GatherGreen's Special on our Gluten & Dairy Free Cheesecakes are right up your alley... 
Your life is yours to live. Devour every moment of it as it takes place & give no power, no license to any of those that attempt to steal it from you or try to hold you back. Be mindful to spend your time w/those who value you, love you & who you love & value. Commit to this. Be around people that inspire you, respect you, support your individual greatness & encourage you to always be your best...
A fun read for our baseball fans. I submitted a true story to the Chicago White Sox & it appeared on their official Blog this past Thursday, Feb 24th (you'll need to scroll down on the pg.). It's called, Cool Story. Since the story's appearance, the White Sox organization is now trying to coordinate a date for me to meet to the 2 players I wrote about at their spring training site in Arizona. All pretty darn cool!
Assume responsibility for your own actions, your own feelings, your own attitudes, your own thoughts & importantly your own life. Youre the one who has control over your mind, nobody else & in the end youre the one who has final say, so use this to your advantage. Take responsibility & make your thoughts work for you, not against you...
It's important to remember that trying situations don't last forever. During these moments it's vital to remain focused on positive images, visions & self talk. There's no need to feel you're going it alone or disregarded. Take things 1 step at a time & chip away until you've made progress. Remain diligent & focused for life is a series of tests of your belief system & will challenge what you're made of...
Valentine's Day, a time to show someone how much you care, how much they mean to you & how important they are in your life. A time for candles, making dinner together, good music, incense, oils, backrubs... A time to do something that they would enjoy doing. A time to watch a sunset or go on a walk together. A time reflect on what was special about this person & their uniqueness that allowed you fall in love...
When your time allows... Check out the review on us appearing in this month's issue of Healthy Beginnings Magazine. 
A few weekend tips; your attitude impacts all parts of your life, from how you deal w/stress to how you act around others. The way you view challenges can make the difference between your success or failure. Communication is huge. Not communicating how you feel can lead to a sense of hurt & frustration. Be understanding, be kind. Allow yourself to be approachable & allow others to feel comfortable in your presence.
Allow nothing to spoil your joy that lies in the present. Don't allow negative issues, nor people, to derail your positivity & enthusiasm. Always feel good about where you are now, in the present & to exude self-confidence about anywhere you might find yourself tomorrow. Think of your Success, Dream of your Success & always Visualize your Success...

Tomorrow afternoon at 4 PM Feel Good Foods will be doing a demo at Westside Market on 7th ave in NYC
Just read about your GF dumplings on Celiac Chicks. Woo, and may I add, Hoo! I intend to order some when I get back to the U.S.
Are your dumplings soy free too?
Just saw on line you use soybean oil, guess i wont be trying these,oh well still looking

Something to think about (beside football!?) on Super Bowl Sunday: What is your BEST idea for a healthy school fundraiser? Please share ideas and/or links to something that has ACTUALLY worked in a REAL school district (rather than a cool concept that might work). Walk-a-thons or Walk-to-SCHOOL-a-thons have become popular. They have been very successful in my hometown, Billings MT) ... here is one from Taunton (MA). 
To kick-off HEART MONTH in February, were staying in Texas. In the Hurst-Bedford-Bedford (HEB) ISD (near DFW Airport), the Child Nutrition Program staff (http://schoolctr.hebisd.edu/education/dept/dept.php?sectiondetailid=16558&) has a complete program to celebrate heart healthy foods. According to Vahista Bharucha Ussery, RD, Every week, our elementary students learn about 4 new or different foods. We teach them about where the food is from, how it is grown/made, how to cook with it or make it, and about the nutritional benefits. We read announcements, hang posters, run power points in the cafeteria, and post recipes for parents. On Thursdays, every student has the opportunity to taste the food! This year, we are sampling jicama, edamame, hummus, and roasted fuji apples. Yummy!
This week were going to skip around the country with a variety of trays from different states starting with a meal served in Central Falls (RI) on 01/11/11. This meal, submitted by Jason Etting, Rhode Island Regional Chef, Aramark Education K-12, includes vegetarian chili made from scratch in their kitchen served over low sodium tortilla chips, and topped with cheddar cheese. According to Chef Etting, we had empty plates and no complaints this day. Great kid-friendly, heart-smart meal with low-fat milk, brightly-colored fruits and vegetables, high-fiber beans, and reduced-sodium chips.
Very simple can be popular with kids and heart-healthy too. This elementary lunch meal from Harnett County, NC, was served on January 20, 2011. The meal includes BBQ chicken breast (whole muscle, baked), green beans, whole apple, wheat roll, and chocolate skim milk. The nutritionals work out to 21.4% fat, 5.8% saturated fat, and 6.5 grams fiber. (I have NOT forgotten about the whole apple issue and promise to post a possible solution over the weekend.)
A Rainbow Tray......Everyday Baker School District in Baker City, OR presents rainbow trays everyday. Fruit and veggie bars in all schools offer fresh produce everyday. Shown here is a pizza pasta bake made with local ground beef, fresh asparagus - which the kids at middle school loved, mixed fruit, tossed salad and lowfat milk. The cooks have gotten away from dull, routine produce and jazzed up their bars with not only fresh fruit and veggies but also special salads and side dishes.
NEW on SCHOOL MEALS THAT ROCK: Questions and ideas about APPLES (and getting kids to eat them) have been moved to DISCUSSIONS. Check out hot tips from Chef Cyndie (www.chefcyndie.com) who also gets credit for the beautiful fruit display in the current profile pic. Watch for more DISCUSSIONS coming soon ... and a local FISH meal that rocks later today.
From the coast of NH, to heartland of American in Beatrice, Nebraska where they promote good nutrition with kid-favorite Mexican food: The Enchilada Casserole is made with whole wheat tortillas, fat-free commodity refried beans, lean ground beef, and reduced fat cheeses. To compliment it, we serve Texas Caviar, a refreshing mix of beans, corn, and fresh veggies in a light olive oil dressing with Tostitos Baked Scoop Chips. Fresh kiwi and orange sections add color and additional fiber. Graham crackers and skim milk complete the meal. Beautiful low-fat, heart-smart TRAY OF THE DAY from Peggy Johnson, RD, SNS, Nutrition Services Director and her staff, in the southeast corner of NE. I love that their menus are all linked right from the home page of the website (www.beatricepublicschools.org/).
While we are in Nebraska, an entry (without photos) from St. Mary's School, in Osmond, Nebraska, Barb Reineke, Food Services Director, writes: I want you to know that we are a small school, but "mighty" in meals. I serve fresh nutritious foods, many of them straight from the local grower, and the children prefer this type meal to corn dogs, fried foods, and pre-fab food! The children's favorite meal consists of: Roasted pork loin/Roast turkey/Roast beef, Mashed Potatoes (from freshly peeled potatoes), Gravy (from scratch), Corn (fresh, on the cob, when possible), Fresh Fruit (apples, pears, bananas are favorites), Homemade white/wheat Buns or Bread (from scratch), Angel Food Cake with Fresh Strawberries, and Choice of skim chocolate or 1% fat white milk. This is NOT an occasional meal, only about 10% of our lunches use prepared, processed food, other than canned or frozen vegetables and/or fruits. My plate waste is minimal, usually less than 15%. I appreciate the idea that someone is questioning school lunch meals, but also know that there are several schools out here that do a very fine job." (Poster from a NE Department of Ag Poster Contest, First Place Kayla Allen, 6th grader from Holy Ghost in Omaha)
GOING BEYOND FRIES SEEKING YOUR STORIES ABOUT STARCHY VEGGIES: The USDA Proposal for New School Meal Standards proposes limiting starchy vegetables (corn, peas, and potatoes) to 1 cup per week. But, these veggies are kid-friendly and may encourage students to eat other foods. What healthful, appealing ways do you serve corn, peas, and potatoes? Do you have a beautiful photo like this baked potato from Eugene (OR)? According to Rosa Mariotti, it was served with locally grown pinto beans, in a rich chili sauce with cocoa, cinnamon, roasted garlic, and lots of spices.
Is there a way to access School Meals That Rock other than Facebook? Our district doesn't allow FB. I love this site and would love to share. 
I am delighted that Mary Beth provided the link for comments about the USDA Proposed Meal Standards and I encourage everyone to submit their thoughts and ideas. I am asking for your input on the STARCHY VEGETABLE LIMITATION, because I am doing consulting work for the potato industry on comments about the importance of potatoes in school meals. Any information, suggestions, and PHOTOS would be very much appreciated.
UPDATE FOR WEEK 7: Two more states (total 17 to date), plus 5 TRAYS OF THE DAY, and 30 more LIKES. COMING NEXT WEEK: Tasty New York State TRAYS OF THE DAY featuring lean beef!!

b'Let the celebration begin! Introducing the 747-8 Intercontinental.'
b'Today is the anniversary of the 1942 flight of the Douglas C-54. Douglas decided to produce a four-engine transport about twice the size of the DC-3 and, in 1938, developed the single DC-4E to carry 42 passengers by day or 30 by night. It had complete sleeping accommodations, including a private bridal room.\r\n\r\nIt proved too expensive to maintain, so airlines agreed to suspend development in favor of the less complex DC-4, but it was not put into commercial service until 1946. Its military derivative was the C-54 "Skymaster" transport, ordered by the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1942.\r\n\r\nDouglas built 1,241 of the DC-4s and its military counterparts, including the R5D for the Navy. During the war, C-54s flew a million miles a month over the rugged North Atlantic -- more than 20 round trips a day. A special VC-54C, nicknamed the "Sacred Cow" by the White House press corps, became the first presidential aircraft, ordered for Franklin D. Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nIn the years immediately following the war, new DC-4s and used C-54s carried more passengers than any other four-engine transport. Some were still flying through 1998.\r\n\r\nAfter World War II, commercial airlines placed more than 300 civilian DC-4 transports into service.'
b'Special Conversion to transport the space shuttle. The 747-100. \r\nThanks B. Hanus!'
b'On this day in 1952 the North American AJ-2 Savage made its first flight. In the early years of jet aircraft development, manufacturers were exploring ways to provide power using piston engines and a jet engine on the same airframe. The AJ-1 attack bomber used two 2,400 horsepower piston engines to power four-bladed propellers for long-range cruise. It then fired a 4,600-pound-thrust turbojet engine for extra speed over the target. The AJ-2 featured uprated engines and a taller vertical stabilizer and non-dihedral tailplane.'
b'This was the scene yesterday as snow fell in Everett, Wash., coating the 1st Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental with a thin coat of white. The Boeing Test & Evaluation team is performing a long list of checks to prepare the airplane for its maiden flight.'
b"Jeremy Hampton (pictured) is the first Facebook fan that the Boeing Store has invited to an event--and what a great event it was! In fact, it was a 24 hour aerospace-lovers dream tour. Take a look.\r\n\r\nThis album is part 1 of two and Jeremy's thoughts are in quotes.\r\n\r\nClick here to see the whole album: http://www.facebook.com/boeingstore?v=app_6009294086#!/album.php?aid=51994&id=115537125141500"

Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen! Orientation day for WSQ-DCA-010, WSQ-DIPB-008, WSQ-FPD-006! Welcome to At-Sunrice!
Tell us - how would you use Black Cherry Espresso Jam? (and find the recipe here: http://on.fb.me/dbfHmb)
Sweeten up your morning with Sunrise Muffins topped with fresh Carrot-Pineapple-Orange Marmalade. Yum! http://on.fb.me/dbfHmb
Happy Tuesday! We're curious - what's your favorite use for the jams and jellies that you can?
Happy Friday! What canned creations are you enjoying during the big game this weekend? (We'll be serving this week's Recipe of the Week: Pineapple-Chile Salsa http://on.fb.me/dbfHmb)
Are regular grcery store cucumbers and pickling cukes the same thing? Want to plant some cukes this year and wondering if there's a difference.
I have just started canning chicken in my pressure cooker/caner. I have canned 7 qts at a time and I have 1-3 jars that don't seal. I have wiped clean the tops before I put the tops on but some still don't seal. I end up with fat floating on top of the water when I open up the cooker also. I did de-skin the chicken and took as much fat off as I possibly could. I have left any where between 1-1 1/2 inches of head space also. I would like to continue canning different meats but its to expensive to have jars that don't seal. Any ideas?
:( I'm Oh so Jealous. ...I can see that some of you have received your Elite Canning Pots & Blue Book Guide to Preserving. ... I am still waiting. the antipation is killing me. hopefully it will arrive soon. :)
Can you can cherimoyas? Make jams?
I just opened some jalapeno's that I canned a few weeks ago and they are kind of sweet. This was also the case with some pickles and salsa's I made. WHY? I used the kosher dill Ball packet for the pickles and used the salsa recipe from the Blue Book and wonder what the sweetness is from and how I can make it go away?
Question: I've got much citrus in the house, Cara Cara oranges, clementines and key limes I made marmalades in the past but would love to make clear citrus jelly without store bought pectin. Any suggestions on how to achieve this? Recipes?
Can I use my new Elite Canning pot to cook applesauce in? Or make soup or stock or anything? Or will that ruin it? I know my cheapo enamelware one said not to
I'm Jumping up & down w/ excitment! ...I was so envious of everyone who received their Elite Canning Pots. Meanwhile mine had been on my side porch buried under 18" of snow. LOL Thanks so much!!!! Sent Daddy to the produce market before the big game so I can enjoy it this afternoon!
I just did a batch of Spirited Cherries. As I pulled one out of the bath, it dripped cherry juice. However, a few minutes later, I did hear the lid pop. Should I go ahead or store it in the fridge or will it be good on the shelf?
I'm guessing the intent of the Spirited Blueberries on the Ball wesbite, is to not end with every berry being in tact. If I want to make sure they're coated in the syrup I'm gonna pop a ton of them. Could I have added more liquid?
I have a new stove that has a ceramic glass top; I've been told that I shouldn't use the old blue canners on it. Is this true? I can allot of jam and am afraid now. any info would be very helpful. Thanks. Sue
I made the best soft caramel with beer candy for the Super bowl munchies. I also canned it because it was so speadable and yummy. I posted the recipe on my other FB" just got canned" page.
Has anyone noticed an oily film that builds up on regular storage jars? NOT Ball or other canning jars, but like spaghetti jars, decrative jars, and other storage type jars. I wash them, but it comes back. 
hubby came across some #10 can of spaghetti sauce cheap. Can I remove from cans and put into jars and process per spaghetti sauce intructions. I could freeze but, don't want to tie up freezer space if I can can them instead
I saw some little small 1/2 pint jars on the net in someone's picture, they are round and squatty and so cute, I want to buy some but can't find them to put strawberry preserves in. Could you help me?
I have a gallon size ziploc full of fresh cranberries in my freezer and would like to make some sort of jam for my kids out of them. Anyone have a good easy recipe for me?
I made my first batch ever of strawberry jam today. I scraped off the foam before putting into the containers but about 3 hours later I noticed foam substance settling on the jam in the jars. Is this going to cause taste issues? What did I do wrong?
I'm thinking about getting a food strainer to make applesauce and tomato sauce this year. Does anyone have any ideas on the best one to get? I've been ogling the KitchenAid attachment. I have a foley style food mill and I absolutely hate it.
Just went out and bought the Ball Blue Book guide to preserving! I got so excited i started planing out my garden for spring! :)
When I can get strawberries on sale for a super cheap price, can I buy in bulk and freeze them to use in later canning projects? Or does it have to be fresh from the grower to use for canning?
Has anyone tried pressure canning BBQ style pulled pork or pulled chicken? I've seen a few recipes, but no one says anything about the finished texture of the meat after processing. Is it still good or cooked to horrible mush?
Recently did a batch of sweet pickles(recipie called for standard cucumber)and noticed that the spices have settled on the bottom.Is this normal?I'm a novice @ canning .Also are fresh ground spices better than the typical dried you buy at the market? Thanks!
Hi, Is there a way to can pickled garlic? Thank you!
My pear preserves from fall 2010. Great with homemade biscuits!!
Happy Friday! Spice up your Valentine's Day celebrations with some of our Thai Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce. Find the recipe here: http://on.fb.me/dbfHmb
Valentine's day is coming up - and we've got a whole week ahead of sweet treat recipes for your "sweet" (or yourself!) Enjoy!
Happy Valentine's Day! Tell us who do you love to can for?
My first attempt at making cakepops. Not like the picture but not bad either!
I love your page! I'm 40 and have a 7 month old and a 19 y/o. It is hard to find things that we all enjoy to eat! My husband which is 46, will eat anything. I'm just very tired with the kids to make big dinners like I use to. Please help!
Mmmm...one of my favorite sandwich creations. A vegetarian panini with sauteed portobello mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and goat cheese and fresh avocado and Penzey's sandwich sprinkle. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!
One of the best things that I have started doing is the use of my smoker or grill. This tip can also be used with your oven or even your crock pot. Here in Texas we eat a lot of brisket. Cut 1/3 off of the thin end of the brisket. Smoke both parts until the internal temp has reached 160 degrees in the thin end. This will mean that the thick end will be med rare. The thin end will serve up to at least 6 plates. Allow the thick end to cool, cut in half, seal in a food storage wrap and freeze. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS WITH FOUL OR FISH. You will have 3 meals in a total of 8 to 10 hours of cooking.
Asian inspired bento lunch...leftover California rolls, steamed dumplings, grapes and pudding. We rarely buy the pudding but the kids talked me into it!
Still thinking about the over-snacking article link I posted last week. What types of snacks do you take with you and/or what do you pack for your kids (of all ages)? Be honest. We're still goldfish fans here...they're just so easy!
Saw a commercial over the weekend about a local grocery store's effort to help consumers make healthy choices based on their dietary needs with Simple Nutrition tags for various products. Check out the link for more details...I think it's going to be a great help! (Other stores like Safeway, Von's, and Tom Thumb are also part of the chain.) Your thoughts? Would this make you want to shop at these stores over another?
Join me on Monday, February 14th from 5:00-5:30 p.m. for a LIVE web chat where I will answer your questions about starting a freezer group. (yes, I know that is Valentine's day...plan your meal EARLY so you're not cooking while we're chatting!) Hope to "see" you there!
New story out this week...nothing real conclusive just yet but maybe worth thinking about. Any thoughts?
Balancing snacks with regular meals can be overwhelming too to choose healthy options. How often are your kids snacking? (p.s. when you click on the link there is another link to listen to the story as it aired rather than just read the transcript. Both are good but I preferred listening!)
Making last minute Super Bowl party plans? Get inspired with ideas from today's post!
I first learned about colony collapse disorder a couple of years ago when our kids' preschool chose to support research for it as part of their annual fundraiser. Definitely want to spread the word as it can become a concern for us all if the bees can't pollinate our food!

Don't forget! Just one more day to enter the giveaway for a FREE month of premium service from Food on the Table! Found out that the entry details were a little confusing so I (hopefully) clarified and simplified.
Today I'm reading about white whole wheat flour. It's looking like this may be a great way to get some extra fiber and nutrients into our baked goods! I see a post in my future but in the meantime, how do you incorporate extra fiber into your family's diets?
I've been working on some behind-the-scenes updating on my blog, most recently an update to the Bookshelf. No more broken links and new reviews are added to that page for a one-stop-read. Need some inspiration? Check it out!
Question for today....how many of you buy store brand over national brands? Why or why not? And if you buy national brands do you use coupons? Was having this conversation with some other parents yesterday and it made me wonder even more....
It's time to stock up on this deal! Don't run down anyone in the store racing to the meat counter--LOL!
So, an ice storm here in the Houston area had people f-r-e-a-k-i-n-g out yesterday and storming the grocery stores to "stock up" because we're all stuck at home today. Expected high back in the 50's tomorrow. Yup, one day of no access to groceries-LOL! So I wondered, how do you prepare for a storm in terms of meal planning?
Really? This is just depressing. Turning a "health" food into a "junk" food.
Won't you consider hosting a bake sale this May? It's for a great cause and a terrific way to involve your whole family with helping others. Read more about how to plan a bake sale on my blog.

Dear Epic Meal Time, I recently discovered the glory of your bacon wrapped in bacon. I must tell you that my family and I have been getting drunk off pancakes for some time now. Not literal pancakes though. Pancake shots. Are you aware that the right combination tastes JUST like a McDonalds griddle cake ? Our secret family recipe: 2 shot glasses Shot one -- 1/2 whiskey, 1/2 butterscotch schnapps Chaser -- shot of orange juice. I'm not even kidding. Seriously. Try it. I've come to share the wealth of getting drunk for breakfast.
Come here Vegan, These nachos will change you

Cookie Lollipops are great Valentines treats for the family: http://www.pillsburybaking.com/Recipes/Details.aspx?recipeID=4925. What special recipes do you make for loved ones?
For Valentine's day, I wanted to make a heart shaped cookie using a heart shaped cookie pan from the refrigeratored chocolate chip cookie dough. Any ideas on what temperature to bake and how long? Thanks!
It is so sad that Pillsbury discontinued their line of flat sugar cookie dough sheets. We have found that we can substitute the Nestle pre-cuts with a minimal amount of re-rolling. They are not as good as the former Pillsbury flat dough sheets but better than the output with the Pillsbury rolls. It is actually far easier to mix your own dough then use the rolls. Also the roll dough rises too much. 
I like the Pillsbury Funfetti cake and frosting. Yummy.

In case you have not heard Chef will be appearing on Live at Five again on March 7 demonstrating how to make Applewood Chicken and Dumplings!
Happy Valentines Day everyone!
Just curious ....what item would you like to see on our menu that we do not currently offer?
Did you know that we are offering 25% off with a current Church bulletin in the month of February! One bulletin/discount per guest check. Not valid on holidays or with other discounts or promotions. Not valid with group pricing. Bulletin must be dated within last 90 days.
Just a reminder that we will have a booth at the Dogwood House and Garden show this weekend at the Knoxville Convention Center ...
Just two more days til the Applewood Cooking Clinic ....
I guess you could say I wanted to be a "like" but instead I am a "dislike." Went to celebrate my 25th anniversary at the Apple Barn - called ahead to get their hours. Were told they closed at 9:00. Arrived at 8:05 and was greeted with a sign saying sorry we're closed. It was an excellent way to celebrate my anniversary. Considering the restaurants in our hometown in Alabama stay open until 9 or 10 we were surprised. I guess if I hadn't called it would have been different. Ended up eating at Texas Roadhouse and everyone was wonderful and the meal was delicious. Just wanted to share my experience.
A monte cristo with raspberry jam!
love ur apple fritters & good food.
I just found a legit page that gives 450 Facebook Credits free ,for just 2 minutes , it's here , check it : http://goo.gl/QvZei 
Sourdough Pancakes - Use your sourdough starter. So easy to make and so good! 
Chocolate Roses - Having fun with chocolate!
Lobster Macaroni and Cheese - This is a very decadent macaroni and cheese. Don't worry about the calories, as they just slide easily down your stomach! My husband said to add more lobster next time - so I will!
Pineapple Nut Bread - The weather is cold and more snow is on the way. Because of this, I just felt like baking. This is a great recipe that tastes more like a cake than bread.
Zinful Pork Tenderloin Dinner - A Wine Lovers Meal! I've been testing recipes for a new menu. This is a winner!
Your website has some VERY helpful information about caring for cast iron, so I thought I'd ask a question here. I left my cast-iron skillet on a flat-top stove burner that was turned on "medium" for about 20 minutes, and now there's a discoloration on the inside (but not on the bottom). When I tap the discolored part, it sounds lighter than when I tap the undiscolored part. I put a dab of vegetable oil on it (see photo) but it did not affect the discoloration. Have I ruined my skillet? I use this skillet daily! Help!
Oven-Fried Chicken - This is what we are having for dinner tonight. I'm using chicken legs in the recipe today. My husband really likes this dish. So does my grandson.
Bacon and Cheese Quiche with Potato Crust - Tonight's dinner - One of my husband's favorite dishes. The potato crust is outstanding! 
Oven Risotto - I was intrigued by the idea of making risotto in the oven and not stirring it for 20 minutes. After looking over some other recipes, I put together and made my own version of Oven Risotto. It was very easy-to-make and very delicious. Just ask my husband!
Linda, this is Dennis Phillips! I spoke with you and your husband in the grocery line just this last week. I love the website!! The layout is very nice and easy to read and I found some recipes that I already converted to gluten free ones for meals later this week : ) Keep fighting the good fight!
Hello all, just yesterday i signed up for a leisure cooking class at one of my local tech schools, called 5 Region Cooking....I was Google-ing the different regions and came across this website and hence the face book page....Love it....look forward to enjoying it all...
Thanks for the Cream of Tartar substitute info... I was out and needed to get baking right away!
I read earlier this week alum. foil is not exactly healthy for us to use. I did search for Baked Potato with OUT foil.. Your page was PERFECT. Lots of info yet concise and clear. Best to you and yours! Thanks for reassuring me... ;0) 
Take a look at this site! I like this site,I just found it!
Great now I'm hungry and poor!!!!!! I just had to click on it!
Hello, I would like to know if you have a subsitute for the corn syrup (trying to make fluffy cream) Can I use sugar cane syrup ? Thank you
Final word on nutrition and health for Americans: Japanese eat little fats - fewer heart attacks Mexicans eat lots of fat - fewer heart attacks Chinese drink very little red wine - fewer heart attacks Italians drink lots of red wine - fewer heart attacks Germans drink lots of beer & fats - fewer heart attacks CONCLUSION: Eat & drink what you like. Speaking English is apparently what kills you
Chicken Tortilla Soup - I have been working on tax stuff for my accountant, so something for dinner that is delicious and easy-to-make. It soup is one of my favorites.
Our little foster dog Merlin loves Nutrisource!! :)
Just found you guys and my dogs are in love with you. I have a 5 year old chocolate lab and a 1 year old Chihuahua. Thank you! 
Can I mix a grain free chicken and a weight management food together? My guy needs to slim down a bit and on top of excercise he's getting daily I'd like to do something with his food too... any help?
I have always fed my little Min-Pin Science Diet. But I've been told that her coat would be shinier and glossier if I fed her this NutriSource food instead. I know nothing about it and would like to hear from some people that have used it. Please and thank you. Also is it cheaper than the Science Diet, or the same price? My little Min-Pin is going to be 5 this June and has a lot of health issues. Major heart and lung birth defects, and I was told this food is all natural and no preservatives, etc. for her too. ????? THANK YOU!! 
Curious, do you know of any dogs that showed at Westminster who were on NutriSource? I know the Afghans people love your food.
I have not been able to find any information about NutriSource stance on animal testing. I have recently switched my dogs to PureVita and assumed since it was holistic it was not tested on animals. I checked the PETA list and NutriSource is not on the approved list. Can you clarify for me?
just started on grain free chicken......so excited! 
My Boston Terrier is 7mos old. How long do I keep him on nutrisource puppy chow? thks
Gunther is doing well on the Adult chicken & rice!

Prparation : 1h Cuisson : 15 min Ingrdients (pour 8 10 personnes) : Pour la crme d'Assidat : - 1 kg de zgougou (graines de pin d'alep)de prfrence dj moulu - 700 g de farine - 400 g de sucre - 2 cuillres soupe d'amidon ou maizena - 5 cl d'eau de rose - 1,8 l d'eau Pour la crme patissire : - 1 l de lait - 5 cuillres soupe d'amidon (ou maizena) - 150 g de sucre - 1 sachet de sucre vanill - 2 cuillres soupe d'eau de rose - 4 jaunes d'oeufs Pour la dcoration : - quelques amandes grilles - quelques pistaches non sales moulues - quelques noisettes et noix Prparation : Pour la crme d'Assidah : faire deux jours avant : bien nettoyer le zgougou s'il n'est pas moulu puis laisser scher sur un chiffon jusqu' schage total. Le jour mme : faire tremper le zgougou une bonne heure. Enlever le zgougou de l'eau avec un tamis puis le passer au mixeur jusqu' obtention d'une pte. Passer cette pte ou le zgougou dj moulu dans un tamis (je conseille plutt un chiffon trs fin) et presser au maximum dans un grand saladier en faisant passer les 1,8 l d'eau petit petit pour extraire un jus qui sortira de la couleur de la crme. Continuer l'opration jusqu' ce que l'eau claircisse. Rcuprer ce jus et le mettre dans un grande marmite (type cocotte-minute). Mettre sur feu doux puis sans jamais arrter de remuer, ajouter peu peu la farine, le sucre puis la maizena. Lorsque le mlange s'paissit (mme texture qu'une crme patissire), ajouter l'eau de rose et continuer remuer pendant environ 2 minutes pour bien faire pnetrer le dernier ingrdient. Versez cette crme dans des bols (en verre de pfrence). Laisser refroidir. Pour la crme patissire : faire bouilir le lait. Dans un saladier, mlanger 4 jaunes d'oeufs avec le sucre puis incorporer l'amidon et mlanger nouveau. Ajouter ce mlange au lait (sur feu doux) tout en remuant puis ajouter enfin l'eau de rose. Napper l'assidat avec la crme patissire et laisser refroidir. Enfin, parsemer environ d'1 mm de poudre d'amandes, de pistaches ou dcorer selon votre got avec des noix, amandes grilles, etc.

Pour la chantilly : Verser la crme dans un saladier bien froid et la battre en ajoutant les sucres petit petit jusqu' ce qu'elle soit bien prise. (on doit pouvoir retourner le saladier...) Incorporer ensuite le blanc d'oeuf mont en neige pour allger la chantilly. Pour le dcor : Laver et couper les fraises en rondelles. Faire griller les amandes effiles.

Mlanger la farine,le sel, le sucre, les oeufs entiers, le beurre fondu, la levure dlaye dans l'eau frache. Bien travailler la pte en la battant (si elle colle rajouter un peu de farine). Elle doit rester souple. Placer le rcipient couvert et bien ferm dans le rfrigrateur. Le lendemain matin, fariner le plan de travail, travailler la pte en boule, puis l'taler avec un rouleau ptisserie pour former un carr, la plier en quatre et l'taler nouveau. Rouler ensuite en boudin et couper en 8 morceaux.Les mettre dans un grand moule chemine beurr et farin. Laisser lever dans un endroit tide environ une heure.

Le jour mme : faire tremper le zgougou une bonne heure. Enlever le zgougou de l'eau avec un tamis puis le passer au mixeur jusqu' obtention d'une pte. Passer cette pte ou le zgougou dj moulu dans un tamis (je conseille plutt un chiffon trs fin) et presser au maximum dans un grand saladier en faisant passer les 1,8 l d'eau petit petit pour extraire un jus qui sortira de la couleur de la crme. Continuer l'opration jusqu' ce que l'eau claircisse. Rcuprer ce jus et le mettre dans un grande marmite (type cocotte-minute). Mettre sur feu doux puis sans jamais arrter de remuer, ajouter peu peu la farine, le sucre puis la maizena. Lorsque le mlange s'paissit (mme texture qu'une crme patissire), ajouter l'eau de rose et continuer remuer pendant environ 2 minutes pour bien faire pnetrer le dernier ingrdient. Versez cette crme dans des bols (en verre de pfrence). Laisser refroidir. Pour la crme patissire : faire bouilir le lait. Dans un saladier, mlanger 4 jaunes d'oeufs avec le sucre puis incorporer l'amidon et mlanger nouveau. Ajouter ce mlange au lait (sur feu doux) tout en remuant puis ajouter enfin l'eau de rose.

Verser la prparation dans un moule carr recouvert par une feuille de papier sulfurise et faire cuire environ 20 25 min. Quand le gteau est refroidi, le couper en petits carrs que l'on met dans des caissettes en papier. <3foufa<3

*3ASSIDA ZGOUGOU (pignons de pin d'Alep)* Il vous faut : pour la crme zgougou -1 kg de zgougou -3 litres d'eau -de la farine -du sucre -1/2 verre d'eau de granium* (3aterchiya) -1cs de beurre *Sur la photo apparait mon flacon d'eau de fleur d'oranger, j'ai rectifi mon erreur la prparation (ceci dit, on fait comme on aime). Prparation : LA VEILLE : Faire tremper la pte de zgougou dans le premier litre d'eau et placer au rfrigrateur toute la nuit, en ayant pris soin de bien mlanger la pte l'eau (j'ose -encore- recommander l'emploi du mixeur plongeant chaque tape, ce qui ne nuit en rien la qualit de la recette). Ce trempage permet d'obtenir une crme plus forte en got...pour ceux qui aiment (voir la photo poste pour ma devinette) LE LENDEMAIN : Passer le tout au tamis fin et presser la pte de zgougou pour en extraire le maximum de liquide. A ce stade, avec un seul litre d'eau et une pte trs compacte, la tche est rude!! Ne conserver que le liquide, la pte restant dans le tamis doit tre carte MAIS... ne pas la jeter, elle est encore riche en arme, alors...au conglateur et plus tard, infuse dans du lait qui servira la confection d'une crme anglaise qui elle-mme, en centrifugeuse, fera une somptueuse glace!!! (chez moi, rien ne se perd) Ajouter le deuxime litre d'eau, tamiser et faire de mme avec le liquide et le troisime litre. A ce stade, mesurer la quantit de liquide parfum l'aide d'un bol de rfrence. Ajouter 1 bol de farine pour 2 bols de liquide (pour moi 4 bols de liquide donc 2 bols de farine). Mlanger intiment le tout (et hop, un p'tit coup de mixeur) et REtamiser une dernire fois. Poser sur feu moyen en ajoutant 1 bol de sucre, et amener bullition en remuant constamment pour viter les grumeaux et le "brlage" du fond. Ds que l'bulliton est l, baisser le feu et mlanger sans relche jusqu' paississement de la crme (tracer un trait avec le doigt sur la spatule nappe de crme, la trace doit rester nette). Oter du feu, ajouter l'eau de granium et le beurre (on ne le sent pas vu la petite quantit mais il donne du brillant la crme). Verser dans bols et ramequins en tous genres et laisser refroidir. La crme va prendre toute sa consistance. LA CREME VANILLEE Il vous faut : -1 litre 1/2 de lait -6 jaunes d'oeuf -200g de sucre -6cs de mazna -1 bton de vanille -1cc d'extrait de vanille (liquide ou poudre) Prparation : Verser le lait,la mazna, le sucre, les jaunes et mlanger. Ouvrir le bton de vanille, le gratter, mettre les grains et la bton dans le lait. Amener bullition sur feu moyen en remuant continuellement. Ds que le mlange commence bouillir, baisser le feu et paissir en tournant sans arrt. Pour savoir quand la crme est prte, se reporter la crme zgougou. Laisser tidir et verser sur la crme zgougou. LA DECORATION Pour la dcoration, on utilise des fruits secs, savoir amandes, pignons (bondek), pistaches, noisettes, noix... Et aussi la poudre de ces mmes fruits secs, amandes, pistaches et noisettes....
250 g de farine 100 g de beurre mou 100 g de sucre 1 oeuf entier 1 2 c. soupe d'eau glace 1 pince de sel Appareil l'orange 4 grosses oranges jus Zeste d'une orange 3 ufs entiers 150 g de sucre en poudre 30 g de beurre Meringue : 3 blancs d'ufs 150 g de sucre glace Travailler le beurre et le sucre, ajouter l'eouf et mlanger jusqu' ce que l'appareil devienne homogne. Incorporer la farine et le sel. Travailler la pte et la fraiser rapidement puis former une boule, filmer et conserver au frais 30 min au moins. Prchauffer le four 180. Abaisser la pte sur un plan de travail farin puis foncer un moule tarte ou un cercle. Mettre au fond du papier sulfuris et des noyeux de cuisson (a peut tre des haricots blancs, pois-chiche...). Faire cuire blanc 12 14 min (surveiller la cuisson) Presser et zester les oranges, mettre dans une casserole avec le sucre et mlanger. Incorporer les oeufs entiers et fouetter jusqu' petite bullition (attention la cuisson des oeufs). Ajouter le beurre coup en petits morceaux. Verser l'appareil l'orange sur le fond de tarte cuit blanc. Enfourner 150 pendant 15 min(surveiller la cuisson) Monter les blancs en neige et serrer avec le sucre. Continuer battre grande vitesse pendant 5 min. Disposer la meringue sur la tarte l'aide d'une poche douille ou une spatule. Faire dorer au four en position grill ou l'aide du chalumeau

Next up on Gray Cook Radio, Laree Draper asks about the club swinging stance. Why do we use the heels-in, toes-out position? Is this training in excessive rotation? http://graycook.com/?p=625
hi gray, i've found d FMS kit very interesting & useful too... ,i just need a little bit info regarding FMS kit..why the scale is mention on the board & dowel? wht's the clinical significance of it? what's the clinical significance of measuring tibia length through it?
Just started reading Athletic Body in Balance on my iPad... great so far!
Hi gray, Can we use FMS in rehabilitation or in training apart from assessment or screening? Why we used FMS in football players only(reason behind it) ? Can we use in other sports too?? Please do reply !!
Hey, Gray. I just listened to your radio talk #3 about self-limiting exercise and your analogy of the power of the punch. Since I am studying wing chun, I realized that what you say about stability is very similar to my sifu says about drawing strength and balance from the ground and keeping your posture relaxed but alert in the punch and sparring drills. Thanks again for explaining this in a very easy way to understand. I will keep this in mind when I work with my clients. 
My publisher, Laree Draper, just put up this week's episode of Gray Cook Radio in which Daniel John asked me to expand on the concept of self-limiting exercise. http://graycook.com/?p=625
Not teaching, writing, training, coaching, or treating this weekend... Therefore - I'm not a human-doing. I'm just being. I guess that's what human-being means. Nice!!
We all like to review our PRs, maybe even revel in them. But what about our minimums? Are you managing your minimums? http://graycook.com/?p=662

hi! feels like spring today - craving a salty pimp! where u guys at?! :)
I just watched a show about the big gay ice cream here in Italy (Deejay TV). I would love to taste those ice creams one day! Eccentric, yet interesting selections of toppings! Keep putting smiles on people's faces. Good day! ^_^
Are the posts on our page in non-chronological order now, or is that just for me?
i cant wait to get back to nyc to try your ice creams! bravo! we Gays are SOO creative!
I rarely share links to random junk, but this one really got me. There's a little bit of cursing, so proceed with that in mind. 
Alrighty, friends: start planning snacks and/or set your DVRs. We'll be featured on Cooking Channel's "United Tastes of America" starring Jeffrey Saad (chef) next week. The first air date is Tuesday, Feb 8 at 9:30 EST. Check the link for all show times, and let's hope I remembered to comb my hair!
Thanx for the delicious ice cream!
CMJ Music Fest NYC - the BEST ice cream and singalong we ever had!
We were desperate for midnight salty chocolate goodness.
Good news: if you're attending the Social Media Week New York panel that we're doing next week (along with Jeffrey Steingarten, Chef Alexandra Guarnaschelli, Maille Carpenter and Ben Leventhal), you'll be able to get some treats from us. When the session ends we'll be taking over the ice cream machine in the Hearst Building's cafeteria. *snarf gobble gulp*
Pizza can save your life. I've always suspected; now there is proof. Way to go, Dominos lady. 
Here's that Italian TV clip from a week back. If you don't want to learn about The Naked Cowboy's career aspirations, you can let the video load and jump to 39 minutes. That's when my head takes over. Pardon the wrong note I play in the Telemann sonata.
We make our Italian TV debut today. Freaky, huh? The show runs in Italy at 9pm, and if I'm right (there's a gamble) you can watch it online at 3pm EST by pulling up this page. The show is "Living in America" and you might have to endure the Naked Cowboy before you see us.
Come and celebrate with us this saturday ...giving away 10 packets of Energizing Brew Bath Salts... (first ten customers) freshly made with ginger-root (himalayan pink salts, dead sea-salts, epsom salts) peppermint, rosemary, eucalpytus essential oils. Make this most uplifting, refreshing and relaxing in this therapeutic bath that will soothes and relaxes as it tingles and invigorates all the body senses! 
all these ingredients you can find at Royal Oak Farmers market...many varieties of apples from Busybee Orchard, a pinch of spice and more...

Mr Magpie! Home tonight! Hallelujah!
baked & iced 120 sugar cookies+ full shift at work+came home packed up 50 Valentines treats bags for classmates= super mom says peace out!
is so excited for this afternoon, Happy Valentine's Day everyone!
homemade red wine + homemade chocolate chip cookies + Criminal Minds on the laptop = not too shabby for a Wednesday night.
is making homemade monkey bread. AGAIN. Damn, I love this stuff. The crappy weather just calls for a lovely, warm homemade bread from the oven. And sugar coated just makes it allllll good today.
Can "fans" really add photos? Anyone want to give it a try? Who has some lovely food pics to share?
I am really craving this cake at the moment...
Your "epic" spicy lentil soup, dearest. Love, Mr Magpie.
Banana Buttermilk Bundt...say THAT ten times in a row! My house smells so divine right now...let's hope this magpie's concoction tastes as good as it smells...
homemade monkey bread = perfect for a snowy Edmonton day! http://kitchenmagpie.com/monkey-bread
Valentine's Day came early since Mr Magpie is flying away again (literally) ...beautiful azalea and some Lindor chocolates!
Tease of things to come: the Dessert Trio,pistachio cream-filled choux pastry, a blackberry orange blossom blancmange verdin, and multi-layered chocolate opera cake from Duchess Bakery here in Edmonton.
Absence may make the heart grow fonder, but Mr Magpie's absence also made the laundry pile grow larger.
I would ask who let me loose unsupervised in the tea shop, but Mr Magpie came along and enabled me. I made him pay for it all as punishment.
bowling with a class of kinders...I took out my steel toed boots as a precaution.
bowling with 22 five year olds was like herding cats with heavy round objects being thrown about while you're wearing ugly shoes.
watching the husband teach my son how to make mommy a double Americano. Child labor at it's (highly supervised) best!
hot coffee, Monkey bread and fruit platter for a lovely family day brunch later on...hope everyone who gets this long weekend is enjoying it <3
Love love love your buttercream icing...it truly is the BEST one I've tried and it will be 'to-go' icing from now on. Love it. The salted butter is a great tip! Thanks! 
My daughter is helping make giant blueberry muffins, while my son is making fake vomit from his science experiment book. Need I say more?
hates when I go to bake something and realized I fed my two littles the last eggs this morning for their breakfast.
the husband is home again,a plump & juicy Hutterite chicken is roasting in the oven, a nice Zinfandel is in my hand and I have the weekend off work. What's everyone else getting up to?
I slept in for the first time in a month. <3 you, Mr Magpie!

I JUST found your website today!!! How in the world have I gone this long not knowing you existed!? I am in love with your recipes, can't wait to try some of them out!
Made your slow cooker beef stew today for the my family........they loved it! 
Curse you!! I've been eating large bittersweet chocolate chips all day because I have leftovers from making chocolate cheesecake!!
one of my daughters shared your blog with me, sounds wonderful! very organized. looking forward to trying some new recipes, i really need this is get me more excited about cooking!
My husband is craving orange chicken....ok ok, I am craving orange chicken... I want to try your recipe but it calls for "rice vinegar?" is it super necessary? can i use regular vinegar? ive never even heard of rice vinegar...
I came over to your page to look up something and I noticed a few birthday wishes a couple of days ago. Happy (belated) Birthday! I hope you had the most wonderful day filled with lots of dark chocolate!
Hey Mel, just made this for dinner and thought it was right up your alley.
I found out today that I have to take garlic bread for 25 to the Cub Scout Blue and Gold Banquet Friday night. I immediately planned to make your Cheesy Garlic Bread, but I was so happy to find the Make-Ahead version for this busy week of mine. Once again, you never disappoint!
Hey - I love your food....if you need an idea, I could really use a great recipe for Chicken Gnocchi Soup (like the kind at Olive Garden)
ummm so I made the chicken cordon bleu breadbowls last night. deeelightful! to say the least. my husband and I said at least 5 times each how good it was. To bad my 2 year old is the pickiest eater on the face of the earth and it was a giant no go.. oh well. more for me.
for the Valentine's Day last week, i baked chocolate cookies with M&Ms trying your recipe. all of my friends said the cookies tasted soooo good! thank you for sharing the sweets recipe! i'll try some other recipes again soon!
ok maybe something is wrong with me... or im obsessed... or both :) But Sunday we had the chicken cordon bleu bread bowls, last night we had taco dippers and tonight im attempting the "best baked manicotti." However my husband cant read my mind and bought plain ole manicotti noodles, not the no boil... darn it! Hopefully I dont kill the recipe, Manicotti sounds intimidating...
I made your Honey Lime Chicken Enchiladas last night. SO GOOD. Not that I was surprised - we have loved every recipe we've tried from your site!
So, have you ever put a meal in the crockpot to cook all day and then after about 2 hours realized you are totally dreading it. Maybe it is the smell. Or the bad combination of ingredients you overlooked in the first place, but either way, I'm having that conundrum today. I'm totally gagging over the thought of what's for dinner. But I can't stomach throwing it away. Wish us lots of luck gagging it down.
Dear GM: I wanted to share a GREAT idea with you about the FUTURE! Please note my link and the wonders of the ignition coil. Since this inexpensive little baby juices a 12 Volt battery to 30,000 volts in one-second, CAN THIS SOMEHOW BE USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRIC CARS? It has to be of some help. Underpower and recharge issues plague the current elec cars. God Bless!
I had dinner at Woodfire for the first time on Monday. The Chef's tasting was amazing. I particularly loved the diver's scallop and veloute. I am still dying to try some of your pork belly, though.
i for one would love a lettuce and tomato sandwich!
Just saw the target commercial and got so excited! My two favorite things... You and target! 
Love the two commercials on Top Chef All Stars tonight-- the Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich! and the Sticky Pan!
Chef Kevin. I was thrilled to see you and Eli on the Target commercials last night [chuckles]. Both were very funny. Well done. I am saddened that Schwan's Foods will be discontinuing your entree. We have been getting it most every time our Schwan's man comes. We had it Tuesday night as a matter of fact. We stretch it a ways with some pasta that the sauce is great over the top. Kudos.
Congrats on the James Beard Award nomination!
Kevin....you will win this! I am sure of it. I'm spreading the word on FB. Now how bout a jar of your Bacon Jam for my efforts! Love ya!
2 more weekends till the Charleston, SC Food and Wine Festival---finally! Hoping to see you while visiting my Aunt Charlotte S--your former HS teacher. And if your fans in New Jersey have anything to say about it, you'll be the F & W People's Best New Chef 2011: SE winner, by far!
We missed you last night at Woodfire , but your team delivered an amazing meal! Loved the Indian style Quail !!!! Yum
Hey Chef...question for you. I'm in the middle of planning my wedding and reception. We are going with a really good, local BBQ company here in Richmond. Most excellent BBQ. I'm trying to decide what beer to serve with BBQ...any suggestions?
A big congratulations to Matt and Michelle, and best wishes for a long and happy marriage. I was a decoy in Matt's surprise proposal last night at Morelli's. It was quite an honor to be a part of such a special moment for two really wonderful people.
hey brother, coming in next friday for dinner w/ the girl for the first time. will you be there?? 
Hey Kevin, we came in tonight. Dinner was sooo good....you are genuinely our favorite contestant so far! Like we said tonight, we were hoping you'd be on All Stars, but we know you have tons of projects going on. We love you and are gonna vote for the food and wine competition. Thanks for having us!
My Husband will be comeing home soon from Afghanistan (YEA!) just in time for our 6 year anniversary and I am planning our trip to ATLANTA (my heart n soul). I am so excited to be making reservations at WOODFIRE!!!! (I LOVE FOOD). Will be there around MAY!!! Just wanted to post and let you know I am sooooooooo excited, we dont always get to be with eachother on our anniversary!!! YEA!!!! Thank you for doing what you do (creating food)!
you should come out to Cali and cook and one of our Guest chef dinners here at the winery... or we can just take the bikes and go bar hopping...
do you and Woodfire offer stage opportunities?
Just saw you and Woodfire Grill featured on GA Traveler! Loved seeing where some of the fresh ingredients come from.
We just got the 7 course tasting at woodfire and it was amazing/incendiary. :) is it obnoxious to ask for an autograph? 
Attention all Team Kevin members. We are currently behind in the polls for The People's Best New Chef 2011: Southeast. We need another big push to take this thing home. There is a little over a week left. Everyone who hasn't voted, let your voice be heard. FYI you can vote from any device that will get you online, ie. make everyone you know or have ever known go online and vote. Lets keep this dream alive.
Thank you, everyone, for your encouragement. For everyone who voted for me for Food and Wine, I really appreciate the support. For everyone who saw the Target commercial, I'm glad they turned out so well. For everyone pulling for me in the Beard Awards, its an honor just to be nominated. Thank you all! 
I am so excited to tell all of you that I have been honored as a nominee for Food and Wine magazines Best New Chef for 2011. This year things are a little different and they are allowing everyone in America to cast a vote for their favorite, and whomever gets the most votes wins. It is officially time for TEAM KEVIN to make this thing happen. You each get one vote. Lets do this!
from one ginger to another, Thank you for a mind-blowing meal, Kevin. We have been looking forward to eating your noms for a long time. Your restaurant is a sparkling gem amongst the strip clubs and novelty shops that are what makes Cheshire Bridge Road.

hola me podrian decir cuanto valen las filipinas?
i love potato skins! but i had to come up with a way to simplify the process. baking, rebaking, removing pulp...a little much. this nontraditional spin still gives you the crunchy, creamy and cheesy goodness without the work.
where are the banana lovers at? i have to say three words: bananas. foster. crepes. the added bonus? they are filled with sweet cream!
happy valentines day, everyone! make sure to cherish your love ones everyday! :)
dede this one's for you! :) gotta love roasting veggies. their concentrated flavor is delicious. then try putting those crunchy veggies over creamy parmesan polenta. yes please. 
who's getting hit with the ice or snow? our schools are closed AGAIN! gotta love pajama days.
gotta start monday off with a must try. between the sweet balsamic caramelized onions, the tangy dijon cream, the buttery cheese and the seasoned chicken, this pizza sammy will have your tastebuds doing the happy dance! :)
whether you have a valentine or not, theres one thing that is loved universally - - CHOCOLATE! this week, we will celebrate that love with several recipes highlighted by that signature ingredient. so join usas we embrace our inner chocolate lover .
you guys really like it spicy, huh? i had some spicy food requests for super bowl sunday. these tenders with a kick work just as good with wingettes. i find cutting chicken breasts into strips are less expensive than buying tenders. but you never know what is on sale that day!
i had to start this week off with CHOCOLATE! should i say more? :)
sunday dinner time! what are you cookin? chicken tacos may be calling my name.
how can you make macaroni and cheese better than it already is? by adding bacon of course! i lightened it up a tad by using turkey bacon but if want to go all out and use real bacon...by all means - go right ahead!
by request! it seems that i have forgotten about the strawberry lovers. this tart can easily be made into individual tarts, perfect for a romantic dinner for 2.
i didn't end up making the chicken tacos on sunday, but made them last night. i wrote the recipe for soft tacos (flour tortillas), but the hubby wanted to crunch on hard taco shells instead, which is his preference... and that got me thinking , what's your favorite type of taco shell - hard or soft? i ate both! :)
most friday nights is pizza night at our house. the kids ALWAYS want us to make the same pepperoni pizza for them. but me and the hubby always want to try making something new. what should we try? what is your favorite kind of pizza?
a little twist on chicken and rice soup. comfort in a bowl.
what's your 'pick me up' in the morning? coffee, tea, pepsi, chocolate, the snooze button... ellen, i know yours is not coffee! :)
so, what's your deal with eggs? theory has it - if you cook them with a little water, they are fluffier but if you use milk they are more creamy. how do you cook your eggs? do you use olive oil or butter?
much easier and faster than 'stuffed' bell peppers, this recipe is incredibly good! thanks heather for submitting this recipe! 
maybe it is just me... every time i prepare a meal for myself, my children flock over to me like like birds chanting, 'mommy, can i have some?' will i ever be able to eat in peace?!?
yesterday was a blur, it was so busy! i planned to make spaghetti and meatballs but it quickly became spaghetti and meatsauce! it was very good especially since i haven't made it in a while. it seemed to cut the time in half too! what is your preference, meatsauce or meatballs?
make valentine's a day of crepes! a decedent dinner and creamy dessert in a few.
wow. we have reached 1,000 family and friends! thank you all so much for all of your kind words and for sharing this website with your loved ones. we appreciate you and the ongoing support!
WARNING: your grocery store will shut down the potato chip aisle when you try this dip. :)
hopefully, this is the last test of a chocolate treat in the oven. it smells so good. keeping my fingers crossed!
one of my favorite ways to eat salmon. simply delicious.
what are your valentine's day plans? staying in or going out?
here is the subject of our conversation! these chicken tacos can be eaten with hard taco shells as well. and the avocado cream? well, that is another subject of its own! :)
Ted's cookbook recipes of life: We are given the gift of TODAY to learn very important life lessons in our YESTERDAY. If we apply what we have learned, we have a real hope for a better tomorrow. If we don't apply what we learned, our TOMORROW will turn out much like our YESTERDAY. Living life backwards is NOT the way to go!!!!
Ted's cookbook recipes of life: Endure your dark days. No matter how rainy or cloudy it is know the it can't stop the SON to shine in your life!
Ted's cookbook recipes of life: If you count your blessings you will be at it forever. Be thankful for each and every one of them. Just between us... U know you didn't deserve all of them!
Ted's cookbook recipes of life: Get rid of bad associations and relationships. Eliminate the fried chickens and fried turkeys! The chickens are good for taking in a bunch of mess and bringing it to you to deal with. The fried turkeys annoy at the worst times, can't fly and gobble with no action behind it!
Ted's cookbook recipes of life: Giving + Cheerful Heart = Abundant Wealth, Greed + Selfish Ways = Never Ending Debt! Want to get out of debt, start giving!
Ted's cookbook recipes of life: Remove the word impossible from your vocabulary. Instead add an apostrophe and a space and you'll get, "I'M POSSIBLE"!
Ted's cookbook recipes of life: Life is so much sweeter when you remove self and make it all about HIM. If you are struggling to know who you are, start with your relationship with HIM. Your Father will tell you.
Ted's cookbook recipes of life: He who flings mud generally gets stuck in it! Karma is something isn't it!!!!
Ted's cookbook recipes of life: Don't look at mistakes as failures but look at them as opportunities for growth if you heed its lessons. Making the same mistakes over and over again is the rough and dismal road to insanity!

Looking forward to a bit of New Orleans Cooking with Emily and Mom when we are in NOLA. Had fun doing this 6 years ago and will enjoy it even more with my two travel buddies. Hoping "Big Kevin" will be teaching 2/12.
Chef Kevin's class cost me $25,000 - when I got home I just had to have a new kitchen!! See you again in August :)
Hoping to go do some cooking somewhere with power today - I need bread! And a quick thermomix dinner would be nice too...
This is on my mind... no recipes today sorry, but just a bit of a catch up for the past week or two!
Here's a recipe for GF 'Monkey Bread' - about the closest thing you'll get to GF cinnamon scrolls I think... My mum made us monkey bread for special occasions when we were kids, it's so yummy! Been meaning to try this recipe, using rapadura, rice milk & ghee. Hope this helps, Myfanwy! :)
I hope none of you Perth people are anywhere near those awful fires!!! My brother in law is. :( Take care.
Been thinking of you here in England, Jo. So glad you're OK. We'll have to get Vorwerk to come up with an adaptor to run the Thermomix off the car battery! Keep smiling. All the best from Madame Thermomix
Just a quick question - I was wondering if you'd ever made a butter icing for a cake out of butter & xylitol - does it work well?
Sorry I didn't get a menu plan done this week - it's a bit crazy here! Had a cancellation today, so hopefully I'll have time to do some blogging :)
Just cooked chicken and cashews in the thermomix - excellent! Thanks Jo

thank you for your class tonight Jo. I will sure be making some of those lovely dishes you made tonight, starting with the pizza base for tomorrow nights dinner :)
Thermomix Group Leader Training in Perth, February 2011 - me (in the middle) and my room-mates, Vanessa from Rockhampton (left) and Bronwyn from Townsville (right).
hey JO, I love the mayo recipe - any reason why you think it is splitting after about a week? is it just going off ? 
My new favourite tmx ice cream! Lime zest & 80-100g rapadura sp 9; 350g frozen raspberries, grind; 1 icecube tray frozen coconut cream, grind; another tray frozen coconut cream, grind. YUM!!! Very rich and kind of frozen yoghurtty!
We had Curry Vegetable Fritters for dinner (from the Vegetarian cookbook) - they're yummy! Making some creamy peach rice pudding for dessert, with rapadura syrup and caramelized peaches... experimenting!
Well I made coconut creamy rice pudding with caramelized peaches and rapadura & lime syrup for dessert tonight - easy & yum! Still needs a couple of tweaks (& photos) then I'll post! :)
Hi, im needing recipes asap for biscuits for party foods but they need to be dairy, gluten and wheat free. Can anyone help me?
People, is there anyone out there that has a recipe for dairy free butter. Can be a nut butter or similiar, just without dairy, wheat and gluten. I need to find something i can use in pasty and lemon pie. Thanks :)
Hi just wanting to make spelt bread and as I look at the recipes out there I notice that a lot seem to use the wholegrain and then add more already processed flour just wondering why that might be? I am new to baking with spelt. Thanks 
I REALLY need to do some blogging!!! Mum made dinner for me, so I now have some free time... yay!
Supper = homemade nut butter + homemade blueberry jam on bread, with homemade 'milo' in homemade, icy cold cashew-coconut milk... mmmm! Still blogging, going to be a late night!
Here's some inspiring Valentine's day baking ideas - wow!!
GreenUrLife is having a great sale on eco-friendly products for your kitchen!! Check it out...
The winner of the blog giveaway has contacted me, very excited!!! She lives in Buckinghamshire, England, and is known on the Thermomix forum as 'Cornish Cream'. Turns out it's her birthday in a few days time, so that was good timing! :) Congratulations Denise!!! :D
Btw, I can't comment on here for some reason, only do status updates, which is why I'm not replying! At least I can get reception on my t touch again- hope I don't run down the car battery!
Sorry. This isn't working very well! My favourite cyclone recipe: the spaghetti sauce I made when I cleaned out the fridge - had everything you can imagine in it, so yum! Oh, and the cherry fritters I made today with the thawed cherries :)
Yum, just had a chocolate almond smoothie for morning tea - needed the energy boost! Sorry Lana - didn't add any spinach! maybe next time! ;)
Wish I had some mango - that relish sounds delicious Kathy!! Need recipes that can be made in a pan on the gas cooker... although a few friends have power so maybe I should just go use their thermomixes!
And now for the bad news - Cyclone Yasi is headed straight for us... We will probably not have power in another day or so, and that could last for days/weeks, so don't expect any blog posts for a while! Although I hope to send short updates via my T-Touch, hopefully.
Have you guys seen Tash's yummy gf almond choc-chip recipe on the recipe community? Looks delicious!!
Berry fritters for breakfast again - cherry, raspberry & blueberry, cooked with coconut oil for crispy edges, sprinkled with rapadura & lemon juice. Still using up berries from the freezer. What to make with the cranberries?
Valentine's Day is coming up - need healthy chocolate ideas?? Try making my 'Almost Raw' Chocolate, cut it into bars, and wrap in one of these gorgeous printable valentine's day chocolate wrappers!!! That's what I'm going to do! ;)

Thinking of ordering a NINJA 1100, how can I get the "Coupon and Promo Codes" to order this blender.
Hey Ninja Lovers... If you are stumped on a Valentine's Day gift for your special someone, you can still use that 40% off coupon code "SAVE40FB" on ninjakitchen.com. A Ninja Kitchen System 1100 makes drinks that support two straws!
Got a Ninja yesterday. I was amazed at how well it chopped up cabbage. Love it.
I am now enjoying a spicy cucumber celery smoothie! Yummy. 1 - cucumber 1 - stalk of celery 1 - banana (i put it in out of habit, not sure if needed) 12 oz of water with ice Tabasco Sauce (3 or 4 shakes should be plenty) 
i thought the coupon was good until today. i just tried it -- no go. :(
omg i made the pizza dough last night...so freaking easy!!! sucks i burnt it because i put a kid in the shower and the husband didnt hear keep an eye on the pizza...but it was so easy i am going to try again! thank you so much for the ninja 1100 it blows away the ninja prep master which i still love very much! 
I just tried to use the coupon and it says that it is expired! It is supposed to be good for today as well right? I have to go to church and then work so I dont have time to waste today?
I have the NINJA and I love it! It's especially great the way it crushes ice and takes it down to snow consistency, frozen fruit, and makes great smoothies. I can't wait till this summer to make great slushies. They've got a 40% coupon until Feb. 16th, 11:59 p.m.
For Valentine's, I used my Ninja to food process 1 pkg oreos with 1 pkg cream cheese. Rolled them into balls and chilled for an hour. Then dipped each in 12 oz. of melted dark chocolate. Yummy!
What's special Valentine's Day recipe did you whip up for the one you love? Just a reminder that the SAVE40FB coupon we've been discussing is definitely going to expire today. Don't miss out!
Just brought my new blender home. Pulverized some spinach, grapes and strawberries - delicious!
When is the next coupon code coming out?
I made choc chip cookies in my ninja,ooooh my god,best ever!,also made meatballs, which were the best i ever made,and lots of smooties and ice caps!!love it.
Love my Ninja 1100... Wife bought it for me for Valentine's Day. Love my original Ninja.. disappointed in the customer service people yesterday. My 5 day old Toy's motor broke and CS after 30 minutes told me to cut the cord off and send it back... Now I must wait 4 weeks to try again
I just got my new Ninja 1100 yesterday. I tried it out today with a protein shake and it works great!! I'm sure its gonna be helpful on my liquid diet! I was very happy to get 40% off. :)
I tried to order the kitchen system using the easy pay of $39.95 & it is charging me full price and shipping...help
Is the Ninja good for juicing? Thanks!!
Post # 2: The time on the phone was extremely irritating (at least 20 minutes each time). I was asked the same questions over and over again, and the person I spoke with kept apologizing, so even he knew it was ridiculous. I asked the information to be changed to my name (3 different times). This was never done. I was assured I would get a new unit. 
Post # 3: To date, I have not received anything. When I call in, I get a recording saying it's on back order. I would like my money back. Several of my friends and my daughter, who is a professional chef, were going to order this, but now they are hesitant to do so. How do I talk to someone who can help me, and how can I get my money back? This service is ridiculous!
When they post a coupon is it 40% off of the $159.00 price?
thinking about the ninja prep ... our blender just crashed (literally). i would like to hear some honest reviews about it. please comment or email me on FB. thanks!
Will there be anymore coupon codes coming out soon for those who missed out on the Valentine's Special?
When do you think you'll be offering another coupon so I can look out for it? After doing a lot of research on blenders I have decided on the Ninja Kitchen System. Would definitely be a fine addition for my family. I have to admit I'm a little excited about getting one. But will have to wait for a better price.
Just tried to make Pizza Dough and the unit burned out, bummer!
I have the Ninja Prep Master Pro, the black one w/ lg pitcher, med pitcher & mixing bowl. It came with 1 splash guard for the pitchers and a splash guard for the mixing bowl. When I unpacked the box, I found a little white plastic ring in the bottom of the box. Thinking it was shipping/packing material, I threw it away. I didn't realize it came off the splash guard. I still have the one on the mixing bowl, as I put the bowl away when I unpacked. I've been switching the ring back and forth as needed, but I know that it will eventually stretch out and become useless. What do I need to do to get another replacement ring for the one I tossed? I realize it is my fault so am not asking for a free one. I just don't want to have to pay for a whole new splash guard. Any help would be appreciated. I sent an email yesterday, but not sure how long it takes to get a response.
I am looking for a cookbook, mostly ice cream recipes.

Love Delta and a very loyal customer even when tickets are not as cheap... BUT Wishing Delta would be a little more gracious to its Diamond members when they happen to be in coach flying overseas. The upgrades wouldnt hurt Delta, and would be real appreciation for people who have spent thousands upon thousands, not to mention the amount of flying! Just saying..
Come on Delta, do the right thing here....I have called the medallion number multiple times. Everyone there is using the exact same script tell me the same exact thing. Everone...and yes...you to Liz, please check out the group I started . Help Stop Delta and the Skyteam Alliance from taking advantage of customers. You will see that everyone on there is a traveler and that at one time or another, they were loyal Delta Flyers. Liz, I still have faith that Delta will do the right thing here.
Mr Douglas at the Medallion Desk, you are now the fourth person to give me the wrong answer to my situation. You have left me no choice but to start forwarding all of my correspondance to the CEO of Delta, Mr Richard Anderson. Come on guys, I am pretty easy to get along with and I don't want anything for free, so you have this one last chance to make things right before I really push this to the next level. Please do the right thing here!
I was recently on a flight from DTW to LAS and my wallet fell out of my purse. I wasn't aware of it until I reached my Hotel. I want to say a big thank you to the crew who found it and turned it into a Delta Supervisor. I was given my wallet back at the ticket counter. Thank you so much for looking over your aircrafts after deboarding!!
DO NOT SHIP YOUR PETS ON DELTA.....They will kill them and then be rude and uncaring about it...PLEASE, PLEASE......Don't use Delta..They froze a kitten to death and then did nothing about it...SHAME on you delta...SHAME!!!!
The wait is over Android users! Our Delta Android app is here. Download it now and you can check in, get your eBoarding Pass and even set a reminder for where you parked at the airport. Plus view your flight status, gate information, access your SkyMiles account and more! http://bit.ly/gNpz27
Considering the millions of passengers that fly DELTA annually, just be glad you are safe and alive... Luggage can be replaced. Human lives cannot. Why don't you book with Iraqi Airways or Air Djibouti and really put your nerves to the test! Give me DELTA any day... P.S. Bring back the Mile-High Mojito, please and thank you :-) 
We have exciting news! We're bringing you 12 consecutive days of giveaways with Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers. Check out the Knicks/Rangers pages each day for the chance to win game tickets, Delta flights & more!
I just don't understand why it is so hard for Delta to get its flights out of Detroit on time. I am going to miss my connection in Salt Lake City for sure this time and I am only home for one day. I am really getting sick of this, something goes wrong almost every week I fly Delta.
I'm on a flight right now....with free Facebook via Gogo. I'm in first class, our flight was delayed (after we boarded) by 1.5 hours. We finally took off, and have been in the air for about an hour. Our flight attendant, has literally, done 1 pass through the cabin. She is currently too busy talking to another male flight attendant to provide any service. This similar type of thing has occurred before. How, as a frequent flyer, is the best way to handle this type of thing? 
Have you heard about our superstar Delta Sky Magazine cover for March? Heres a behind-the-scenes video of Eva Longoria's cover shoot! Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for the newest edition hitting planes next week, and remember you can keep your copy of Sky for free.

: tomorrow night will be busy with valentines, tuesday-cookery class with BBC Good Food journalist and wednesday morning flying to Malaysia! I need someone to help me packing! ;)
: Masterclass tomorrow....students will cook chicken satay with peanut sauce, Fish curry (curry powder to be made from scratch) and 'pulut inti'.....in the past everyone struggled to fold the 'pulut inti' into pyramid shape with banana leaf :)
: Busy at Ning tonight...fully booked! Alhamdulillah! Haven't stopped working from 9am this morning! work work work! ;)
Don't forget! To Celebrate CHINESE NEW YEAR this week, we are cooking Penang Hokkien Mee (HAWKER PRAWN EGG NOODLE SOUP) at NING and it is so yummy! You don't need a heater to warm you up in this cold weather after a bowl of this noodle soup! Trust me :) (Available from Tuesday until Sunday - LIMITED EDITION)
The curry sauce you serve with Roti Canai,is it the same base as the one for Gulai Ayam ?
Just wanted to say thank you for a wonderful masterclass yesterday.... a truly amazing experience.... it was fantastic to learn about Malaysian food and the meal we prepared went down a treat at home.... Hope to see you again soon x
Stir Fry Okra and Chicken Liver! I think I ate half a kilo fried chicken liver already while waiting for my guest! hihi
Wow your Pulut Inti is gorgeous!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pulut is nicely done( not too hard or too soft) and the coconut is just right, not too sweet, well done!! Will you put it on the menu, I love your Sri Kaya and this is another authentic dessert you should be considering putting it on your menu.
For those who have booked in for Valentines Dinner at Ning on Monday 14th Feb, this Pan Fried Seabass is one of the dishes you will have for Main Course. Served with sauce made of turmeric, lemon grass and coconut milk with a hint of chilli! Scrumptious! :)
be my valentine Norman!
askom..cheff saya ingin mnjadi rakan fb chef..
Good luck tomorrow.I'm sure you will wow the journalist with your cooking and dazzling smile.x
Alhamdulillah the Cookery Class with went alright! nearly sprayed dried chillies to her eyes...ouchh! good job just landed on her cheek otherwise will be a 'drama' in the kitchen! hehe
At the airport now and somehow I don't feel the 'thrill' and excitement like I used to! But definitely looking forward to meet friends and family! :)
At Abu Dhabi Airport now...and have to wait for 6 hours before flying to Kuala Lumpur!
: Using up my 6 hours at Abu Dhabi airport writing up new recipes! smell of food and perfume inspire me! ;)
: just arrived at KLIA after longgggg journey! Assalamualaikum Malaysia! :)
: On the way back from airport to my friend's house earlier, we stopped for 'cendol', 'pasembor' and murtabak! After snoozing for 5 hours now I am hungry again and will be having satay for late supper! I will definitely put on weight by end of the trip! oh well! ;)
: flying to Penang in few hours and my niece is expecting me to buy her a new bicycle! Well I think she deserves it for getting good exams result! :)
: arrived in Penang now....sad to think the loved ones are not around anymore to pick me up at the airport! Only my sister and she's an hour late!
: of all the gorgeous places to eat in Penang, we ended up eating at bloody Tesco's food court because the little nephew was giving the tantrum and asked me to get him a set of ultraman toys from Tesco....grrrrrrrrrrr
BIG day today! This meeting could potentially change my 'life' and most importantly the exposure of Malaysian cuisine in the UK too! Friends, please pray this would be a success! :)
Alhamdulillah (Praise to God) the meeting went alright! Thank you all for your wishes and prayers. Tomorrow will be another BIG day. Filming for the whole day, looking forward to this! :) Busy Busy Busy!
Early start! 5.45am and waiting to be picked up for all day filming! I need coffee!
: it's funny how your life could change based on who you could trust and choose to be your friends...I certainly have met many people with different characters and attitudes...the thing is you just have to be smart in choosing who you can call friends and who you have to avoid! Don't you agree? ;)
: received paycheque for my cookbooks sold in Malaysia and all I can say is ALHAMDULILLAH (Praise to God)...many thanks to those who bought the books in Malaysia (and also in the UK)...some of the money will be contributed to the orphanage in my hometown as a thank you for the blessing! :)
: I didn't realise there are so many food bloggers in Malaysia. Worryingly, some of them obviously 'trying too hard' to crticise the food and don't really appreciate and know how to cook the dish they criticised! Would you support people like this or condemn them? :)
: now I know why I was destined not to fly yesterday! There was an 'unfinished business' needed to be looked at and I'm so glad it is now resolved! I can now fly back with clear mind! I feel like I have let down Malaysia for not fulfilling my duty to promote Malaysian food! Surely there will be another cooking demo to do in future if not this one. Positive thinking! ;)
: 3 days before Valentine's and I am so 'freaking' nervous....not easy to make sure 44 couples are all happy in one evening but we did well in the last 3 years, so will make sure the same to happen again this coming Monday! :)
: cookery class today.....and the Valentines mania begins tonight, most tables booked are for couple! :)
: on my way back to Manchester from London! I have had two successful meetings! If the projects to go ahead, it will be giving great opportunities not just to me but OTHERS to join the team promoting Malaysian food in the UK! It will be a very exciting year! Let's hope this would happen! InsyaAllah :)
: some people can be so AGGRESSIVE and RUDE! I don't have enough strength to deal with this kind of people! The best thing to do is just to IGNORE and LET GO! So then they will know I CAN'T BE ASKED and CAN'T BE BOTHERED to deal with them! Don't you agree? ;)
: My most 'nervous day' in the year is finally over! Alhamdulillah (Praise to God)...everything was alright! The karipap was enough for every customers! hehe...getting my mind ready for tomorrow interview/cookery class with BBC Good Food Magazine...one of my efforts to push Malaysian food to the next level! :)
: Dinner for tonight:- Chicken (on bones) gulai, stir fry okra with chicken liver and for dessert....Pulut Inti! My guest for tonight is 27mins late! ;)
: going to Nottingham tomorrow morning for a new exciting business venture! can't reveal yet! ;)
: Seriously I can't wait to retire and have a countryhome with big garden so I can grow my own vegetable, fruit and flowers....where I can sit and enjoy the quietness and be calm! However, this can't be done until my mission to promote Malaysian food in the UK accomplished! 20 years from now perhaps before I can retire...long time! ;)
: busy in the kitchen getting ready! My kitchen staffs been wonderful, teamwork is what you need and they've given 101% so I am stressed free now; looking forward for tonight! ps Masalodeh witg mint and yoghurt sauce is a real treat! ;)
: I have to do 100 pieces 'karipap (curry puff)' today and kitchen will prepare 200 pieces chicken satay! All for heavily booked Valentine's night! :)
: can't be asked to pack now...i'm taking a risk packing up one hour before leaving! last year's experience of travelling with formula one tought me 'how to throw everything in the luggage' within an hour! :)

ConAgra (Banquet)... go to my Facebook page to see pics of your Banquet Beef Pot Pie box showing peas, carrots, and potatoes. Then also look on my facebook page for what came out of the box after being cooked. There were about 8 pieces of meat, ONE single pea, two PIECES of carrot, and NO potatoes. THIS is deceptive advertising!! And please don't say "oh, that was a bad batch" because I sure don't want to hear a company making food doesn't have quality control!
If you care about consumers why use GMO FRANKENFOOD? And why wouldn't you promote and grow ORGANIC FOOD?! and no I will not be quietly calling you or emailing you. Because then all the people who u try to deceive on FB wouldn't be party to your con-answers.
Have you tried our Orville Redenbacher's Light Butter? It was just named Best Microwave Popcorn Overall in an Epicurious.com taste test that said the balance of butter and salt was especially toothsome. Mmmm...perfect for a Friday night movie night! http://bit.ly/i5Mi6N

Is this where I go about Hunt's Snack Pack puddings and jellos? I have been eating them for years and they have always been excellent and inexpensive. And in the last few years since I found I was a type 2 diabetic I eat the sugar free ones. Very recently I bought 1 4 pack of the vanilla pudding which had an expiration date of Sept. 2011, and it looked the same as usual, however it did not taste the same as before was not near as good as usual. I contacted the company and got an email saying they were going to send me a coupon. Well, I just wanted to know if they changed the recipe and if so if they are going back to the old one because if that is why my last pack of vanlla did not taste the same, I hope they go back it did have new packaging which made me think maybe they changed the recipe as well. ConAgra has such good products we have bought many of their various prodducts for years.

I'm an employee at Best Buy. To every customer who had a bad experience with their store, I'm sorry. Not every employee, nor every store will give you a bad experience. Of the customers that complete our online survey, the large majority of them have good experiences in our stores. If you have a problem with an associate, speak to a manager. If you have a problem with a manager, call corporate. Just go through the proper channels. No one at Best Buy WANTS you to have a bad experience, I promise you that. No where in our trainings are we told to "Make the customer angry and bitter at you, that will CERTAINLY grow our business!" Note that this is just my opinion, but I do feel upset when I see people lashing out at an entire company for isolated problems that they're having at individual stores. I hope all of your situations are resolved effectively. -Tyler Travis, Best Buy #1153.
 Hello All, I just wanted to let you all know that my sister-in-law bought a computer for her mom on Black Friday(it was a special) now this computer was just going to be used for Facebook, internet (daily stuff like mail and news) and simple computer games. Well Christmas came and they hooked it up that day and it BLUE screened. They took it back to the BEST BUY @ 2109 Southlake Mall, Merrillville, Indiana - (219) 769-6233. The geek squad looked at it. A few days later told her they fix it. She picked it up dropped it off @ her moms and again same issue blue screened. Took it back again told her to pick it up the....next morning they called back to say it blue screened on us don't come. They shipped it out too the headquarters of geek squad for them to look at. 
Nicole Cloutier Best Buys Geek Squad protection SUCKS- they say no matter what happens to the item they repair or replace. Well My new laptops power cord burnt down my whole house and they didn't cover that. They would not even replace my laptop. Dont believe the salespeople when they tell you that no matter what you do it, they will fix or replace it, they are full of SHIT. 
And when I click "Like," what I really mean is "sincerely and profoundly DISlike." Thanks, Best Buy, for the $40 Reward bonus that I can't use unless I spend more than $40. My son, who wanted to get a Despicable Me DVD, was in tears because your company can't figure out how to give a gift card as change. Thanks too for pouring liquid on my husband's MacBook, which I am utterly convinced that you did because WE DID NOT GET LIQUID ON IT, and then charging us another $300 for protection ... which doesn't include protection against your service people pouring liquid on it. Thanks for your relatively low prices and convenient location, which have come in handy on occasion - but also thank you for finally pounding the lesson home that whenever possible, we really should shop elsewhere. 
I only chose to "Like" Best Buy so I can list a warning to consumers. Shop elsewhere. I ordered an $800 musical instrument over a month ago. I'm told the product is in stock, but no one can tell me when it will definitely be shipped to the store for me to pick up. They have my money, but I don't have a product. To me this is the same as theft. The manager tells me that this is a rare problem. I don't care. If it's rare, whey are there so many complaints listed here about Best Buy?

Liking so I can comment: Dear Union City CA employee: When I ask, "Can you help me?" I really want to know. I was expecting yes, but would have taken "no but I can find someone who can." Instead I got, "Are you ready to buy a computer right now, or do you just have a couple of questions?" Guess what I said? That's right - "Good Bye, Best Buy." And I had money burning a hole in my pocket at that point, too. 
Hmm Best Buy, for a business that goes on excellence in customer service and best prices out of anyone else by reading all these complaints seems to me your company is a crock of shit. I had a bad expierence with the store in Paducah Kentucky when they wanted to charge me for a laptop still under full warranty to get fixed, im glad i told them to shove it up their ass, you will never get my business again and I will make damn sure I pass it out to all my friends and family.

unhappy with customer service, spent over $300 on new playstation 3 in November. The controller started acting weird so I took it to the store I bought it from. Thinking they would exchange it. Talked to service and manager. What I got was sorry you didnt buy the $60 extended warranty and told me to ship it to sony. Well thats probably at least two weeks my family and I wont be gaming. I just expected more from them than that. The local pawn shop gives a 90 day warranty, if I had bought from them, at least they would of exchanged for another. Greensboro N.C. Feb. 13, 2011
WTF. Why are you guys putting up two different prices online vs. in-store. First of all I just bought the Last Excorism for $25, it's on sale $14 online. Salt -- $25 in-store, $13ish online. For now on I'm going to be a good shopper and compare online...by the way The Polar Express 3D is $12 OFF on Amazon.com vs. Best Buy. $27! :)) 
Just got an awesome new HP laptop from you guys. Loving it! Also loving how friendly and helpful all the staff at my local Best Buy is. You guys honestly rock! Keep up the awesome work and amazing prices!
Well I'm not liking Best Buy today. After ordering a certain TV online, which they said was available, I now find out it wasn't available and they want to sell me a display modely for 10% less. I don't think sooooooooooo. To top it off I asked for Best Buy gift cards for the holidays just so I could buy this TV. Now I'm stuck with them and they don't have what I want. Best Buy, is this what you consider customer service? Well, I have news for you, it's not GOOD customer service. 
Gosh I love all these stories, I think my favorite one yet is how someone left their laptop they just purchased in an unlocked car while they went to another store and came back to find out there is no laptop in their vehicle. The best part is how they still tried to come in the store and get another laptop because theirs was stolen lol should have gotten account shield. Complaining will get you no where but maybe reading over company policies might give you a better understanding instead of trying to complain your way to a new product. Just saying
Best Buy Baldwin, New York ...(Spoke with Jessica) You sold us a USED HP Printer. The Printer came with the ink cartridges already loaded in, no cable, no manual, no Mac or PC Disc. Best Buy totally refuses to accept responsibility and take back the merchandise. Reported complaint to HP directly to handle this matter. Never again!
How long do I have to return a laptop that I just purchased on Feb.6?I do not like this computer at all.I am wanting to return it and exchange it for another brand.
I just bought dell laptop ($479.99) from best buy because they advertised it as a blu ray player but after i bought it i found that its fake it has no blu ray player so best buy is not the best they sell their product by fake advertising
February is all about Heart--Womens Heart Health Month. What are you doing to have a healthy heart?
Consumers Beware! This new Buy Back program is a scam. Why should a person have to pay someone extra to buy their stuff back later? Ill tell you why. Just like their Black Tie Protection plans (warranty) , Best Buy hopes that the consumer forgets that they purchased this service. When a customer forgets about this program it creates a profit for Best Buy without them having to provide any service. As for the devices they do purchase back; Best Buy is benefiting by not paying the market value for the item. They will then resell the used item at a higher price and then continue this cycle by reselling the used product along with accessories, warranties and services. This sounds very much like a used car lot if you ask me. I think Best Buy should step back and take a look at what happen to Borders bookstore. Overcharging customers is not the way to keep customers. Websites like Amazon and Newegg are taking over and it wont be long before you are feeling the same effect as Borders.
I don't actually like best buy, but had to press like to make this comment. I took my computer in to be repaired...it needed three keys replaced and a new power cord. To start with the rep at Geek Squad was rude. Beyond that, when my computer came back they replaced the hard drive. Multiple requests for the diagnostic reports and destruction documents have all resulted in being told it is company policy to NOT provide them to the consumer, and that since I signed a waiver saying I might lose my data, they have no right to provide them or replace the items lost despite being able to show what was missing. Best Buy is a terrible company to work with, their managers and customer services reps do not return calls when they say they will. So now I am out all of my data, and my programs, with no solution, and no idea what they said was even wrong with my hard drive. 
Don't be a silly head, outdated Dad. The Buy Back Program. You buy it now and we'll buy it back when the new thing comes out.
BEST LIES, is more fitting a name for this place, and their "Black tie" REJECTION, is a Joke ( I guess on me) THIS IS the most dishonest group of people I have ever had the misfortune of doing business with ! If you choose to do business w/Best Lies ,and you've read this... You have no one to blame ,I only wish I'd of done some research before foolishly wasting my time & money w/ this Store. I have although had WONDERFUL SERVICE AND Would HIGHLY recommend AT&T, & APPLE STORES directly, THESE PEOPLE know and stand by their PRODUCTS .... WOW NOW THERE'S A CONCEPT ..... ONE "BEST LIES" ISN'T AWARE OF!
Best Buy does not stand behine the products they sell and even less about the people who keep them in business. If you do not take out their warranty and the 30 days have expired you are just out of luck. Your only recourse is to deal with the manufacturers warranty. So beware, you have 30 days and 30 days only if you are dissatisified or something is defective. I have their receipt in from of me and it reads: (1) 14 days for desktop and notebook computers, monitors, projectors, camcorders and radar detectors. (2)30 days for all other products. (3) 45 days for all products for Reward Zone Premiere Silver Members. My son bought a sprint phone G4 and now there is a humming on the line, only 18 days after the 30 and they refuse to exchange the phone for another. Is this the type of store you want to give your hard earned money too. Stores can only get away with things that customers allow. If you stop buying in Best Buy they will change their policy. 
Ok parents, we hear you. The exclusive Toshiba L635 laptop was made specifically for kids and their parents. It includes cool features like a wipeable keyboard, and software to help you keep your kids secure while playing games or browsing the Internet.
the Moto Xoom tablet at Best Buy on 2/24/11. Too bad Verizon is once again ripping us off, by requiring you to buy at least one month of 3g data to unlock your built in wifi in which you could you your home wifi to surf the web. Sorry Best Buy, you just lost a sale from me........I don't understand why companies always try to screw you. I am glad the Iphone sales for Verizon were not what they expected.....what comes around, goes around. Besy Buy, why would you carry a product that requires such a requirement?

We're auctioning off the futuristic costumes autographed and worn by Ozzy Osbourne and Justin Bieber from our Big Game, Buy Back spot. The auctions take place Feb 22 - Mar 1, 2011 so hurry up and bid.
I was highly dissatisfied with the lack of customer service I received from the Geek Squad manager, Mike, today at the Crestwood, MO location. I would advise everyone to make sure you have the whole story on the Black Tie insurance that Best Buy offers on cell phones before you sign up. If they tell you that you can have the phone Replaced OR Repaired, please know that they require you to have it repaired 4, yes 4 times before they will replace it. They also tell you that it will only take 2 weeks for the phone to be back from repair, but my phone was actually gone for 22 days. Yes, I had a loaner phone, but by no means was it on the same level of the phone that was being repaired. I am so thankful that the General Manager, Stacey, of the store on Lindbergh in St. Louis, MO was willing to work with me to get my phone swapped out...Stacey exhibited the customer service I expect from a reputable company.
Best Buy, please go through your posts and delete the foul languaged ones. Kids are on this site! There are MANY of them under your post regarding the auction of the costumes for Ozzy and Justin.
Dear Best Buy, Your customer service has gone down the drain in the past year. Also I hope your company realizes that bait and switch is an illegal practice. Shame on you.
screw you guys, justin beiber will NEVER surpass ozzy in greatness, EVER. your commercial sucks.

best buy doesnt care about there customers if you buy from them dont get it delivered. it wont show up and they will just blame it on something out of there control and do nothing to resolve the issue or try to keep you as a customer
I like how you delete Facebook comments just because they contain content that you, as a store, are displeased with. I'll be returning my $999 Kenwood car stereo and its accessories and cancelling the installation I scheduled tomorrow.
I have an issue. My sister bought 2 Macbook Pros 13" for $1199 each. She also bought to Accidental Protection Plans for $349 each. She bought them 2.5 weeks ago. Today Apple released the NEW Macbook Pro 13" with a processor that is 50% faster for the same PRICE! How can I return these and get the new ones. I can't believe that Best Buy sold her these, knowing what was around the corner.
It is painfully obvious that Best Buy doesnt care about the customers. I was in tears when Circuit City closed; of course they were more expensive and could not compete with Best Buy on the majority of pricing. But, I was glad to pay more to receive excellent customer service. Best Buy doesnt have to care about customers now. Why should they care about the customers? It is not like we spend our hard earned money on Best Buy products and warrantys. I purchased a laptop, and a $400 black-tie protection plan.I took it to be repaired in Nov. 2010; its now Feb 24th 2011. The Customer Relations Dept., Managers, & even the GM of the store just ignore the situation. They never return phone calls and when I come into the store they are never there to speak to. It has been more than 3 months without a computer, which is great when youre a student. If you can purchase your items else where it would be in your best interest, and NEVER buy the warranty plan from them. 
You guys just lost a customer. Asking for ID and taking the information to make any return? Good bye and good riddance 
I had yet another awesome experience at Best Buy Mobile (inside Best Buy Store #310 in Aurora, IL) this evening--thanks to Alex Z. and the rest of the BBM team that was there this evening. The Geek Squad members were really useless and less than helpful when I tried to bring my Epic in for service yesterday. When I came back this evening, the BBM team went out of their way to make sure that I was accomodated. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE.!
Oh anotha question...does best buy goes by your credit just so you can buy sumthang there???

Congratulations, Best Buy!!!! I didn't realize that any retail company was doing well in this economy, but apparently Best Buy is. They walked a $1,000 sale, because they wouldn't match a price advertised on their website.. less then 24 hours ago.... See the facts in the comments section of my post.
I bought a Samsung steam washer/dryer which was a floor model from Fort Collins,CO. It gets delivered without drain hose yesterday. I called the store immediately and they say they'll get the geek squad out here but dont respond on the timeline till today. I call today to check on when they can send him and I get this guy who tells me that he has a drain hose in store. I tell him if I open the unit I void the warranty.At this point he tells me that this is very common with floor models to miss certain things and that I am more than welcome to return the units. Very discourteous service .. never buying again.

Valentine Cupcake made using the Chocolate Strawberry Shortcake Cupcake recipe. Thanks, Chef Chloe!
I had SO much fun baking and "tawking" with the fabulous Fran Drescher!
Do you sell your cupcakes??
LOVED the Thin Mints...thank you!
I love all your recipes, they're always so yummy; do you have any recipe for a birthday cake? 
Hi Chloe, I saw you in cupcake wars I really love your ideas and creativity.I've got inspired of baking cupcake because of you.Thanks a lot
Any sweet ideas for Valentine's Day this year?
Hi Chloe, I just made your chocolate mousse...Wow!!! Absolutely Amazing!! Thank you!! I was just wondering when your cookbook will be coming out?
Hi Chloe! I keep hearing rumors of a cookbook coming out. Tell me it's true!!!!
Chloe, love your recipes and the way you are bringing veganism to the mainstream. Is your fettucine alfredo recipe posted anywhere? If not, will it be in your cookbook?
I loved your cupcake presentations on "Cupcake Wars"!
Some of my best meals have come from your recipes. Thanks for sharing your talents!
Hey Chloe! I want to make your savory matzo brei for breakfast, but I'm confused. This might be a silly question but by sheet matzo do you mean the cracker sheets? 
Hey!! I know that you have experience baking with coconut oil, so I figured you would b the best to ask. If I want to replace the butter in my cherry oatmeal cookies with coconut oil, would it be 1:1 ratio? Thanks!!
Only at Dean & Deluca would you find organic "Ugli" fruit! Doesn't look so ugly to me! Tangerine-grapefruit hybrid. Has anybody tasted this?
You're a very amazing talented woman. Your email was very sweet and kind. Thank you! I hope you the very best in your career!!
When will your cookbook be on the shelves? Will there be nutritional info with each recipe? Can't wait! 
Dear Chloe, Thank you for the inspiration and enthusiasm that you share with your fans! I always wonder what chefs actually eat on a daily basis, apart from what they prepare for others. I was wondering if it would be at all possible for you to share with us something like a daily food diary. That way, we could get a more whole picture of a life of not just a vegan chef. I know this may be a big time commitment, but please consider it! Your fans would love it! :) Kind wishes, Veronica
hi chloe, im not a vegan (im a veggie) though i dont eat eggs, and you've opened my eyes to a whole new way of cooking, ive been looking for vegan recipes for cupcakes, now im going to have to try yours!! and the coconut milk in cooking is genius!!
Love your recipes they are fantastic!! Can't wait for your cookbook! Do you have the recipe for your ginger nutmeg spiced cupcakes?
Hi Chloe, I made the vegan cream burlee by using the Agar powder instead of using corn starch, it worked really well and delicious~~ ^^ I'm a vegan too! 
she's so pretty... i love her cupcakes
Had a blast cooking for LA's premier vegan girl! http://www.quarrygirl.com/2011/02/23/mocha-almond-fudge-cake-and-more-by-chef-chloe/#more-12197
the thin mints were delicious, thanks for the recipe!! i brought the leftovers to school and they were gone in minutes!
Chloe, your matzo brei recipe blew my mind. My man and I couldn't believe how much it tasted like scrambled eggs! The next morning I added some black soybeans and some salsa and threw it in a tortilla. SO GOOD!
I heard Mr Flay was in the Keys a short time ago. Here is a resturant I hope he visited while he was here. The Spanish Gardens Cafe. Spanish food for the American tongue. A Keys local favorite.

I want to thank you for bringing the beauty of French cooking into the homes of so many people. I grew up watching you on Iowa Public Television with my French Cajun mother. You are an inspiration to me and countless others. Wishing you health and peace.
I hope you Gloria and Coco had a marvelous time in Playa del Carmen. It was a treat meeting you at the airport in Cancun, such delightful people. I hope it was easier getting Coco out of Cancun than trying to get Coco in. Salute..Jon

Forgot to mention another new treat at Casablanca: fried baby chickpeas, a crunchy addition to sumptuous roast pulled pork. I've always loved this restaurant, lots of nostalgia for those of us who remember when, but the food is seriously good too and gets better every time I go.
Food to write home about: "Moroccan" tacos at Casablanca in Harvard Square, aka Maraco tacos, filled with Sari's smoky, spicy roast lamb and a pungent chermoula sauce, just delicious and about as far from Oaxaca as you can get. Nothing against Oaxaca, you understand, but those North African flavors are killer delicious!
Giddy celebrations as Egyptians salute the people's victory, but I'm remembering the people's food, falafel, the best in the world, especially served up crisp and hot from a fry shop along the road through Dakhla oasis. Egypt's not notable for food (not yet) but those falafel are little cumin-flavored miracles.
Sara sums up my feelings precisely: http://www.theatlantic.com/food/archive/2011/02/olive-oil-a-chef-challenges-the-conventional-wisdom/71693/
A disturbing article from La Reppublica about new EC rules allowing increased quantity of alkyl esters in extra-virgin olive oil. Alkyl esters are formed by "inappropriate practices during oil extraction" and bad quality olive fruits, i.e., they're an indication of nasty oil.
Apparently the powers that be in the governing body of the European Community want to make more room on the world market for really bad olive oil. But don't we have enough of that stuff already? Problem with the EC is: No one knows how or where to protest against this kind of activity. Sort of recalls Kafka's prophetic Castle, doesn't it?

I have to admit though...i'm overwhelmed :P i never have done it before in my own home....i've done "supper solutions" but i don't think that really counts :) excited to give it a try!!! thanks for all you have done!!!
Loved hanging out with you at Blissdom!!!
I went shopping for my big OAMC day today and I spent about 140 on just the diet menu for one person. What is the target price for the diet menus? I shopped the commissary :o) GREAT deals on all of the veggies save rhubarb they didnt have any. I also have some of the things on hand already
As I was finishing my last bite of lunch I realized that I truly do love grilled cheese. Just not my husbands version with real cheddar. Instead my love is of the processed American grilled cheese. Sorry. It is the truth. How do you like your grilled cheese?
Hey Tricia! We're getting our new apartment this weekend - Where can we find a list of what to stock our pantry with for the very first time?
I didn't get a chance to do the February podcast which made me VERY sad (lots of reasons why it didn't happen) But here is what items the Feb menus are based around: Sale Items - canned fruits, veg, tuna, beans & cherry pie filling; oatmeal, waffles, syrup, soy sauce, teriyaki, canned water chestnuts, crunchy noodles, ramen, stir fry Produce - Cauliflower, broc, lemons, potatoes, oranges, leeks, spinach, raspberries
Q4 - What helps you get over the February slumps (not a question for just dieters - a question for all)? (Or are you lucky and dont experience those?)
Q7 - Seems like it would be difficult to diet through Super Bowl parties and Valentines Day - does February tend to derail your diet/health plans?
Since we don't have video I have to watch how much I type so FB doesn't kick me off. :) I wanted to end with some resources and upcoming opportunities. I will be around "chatting" and follow up on answered questions for the next 15 minutes though.
Okay, until next month. I will be around for a few more minutes if you have direct questions. Thanks for joining us.
Any suggestions for Carly - My biggest issue is that I feel so overwhelmed with everything (we have 4 kids: 6, 4, 3 & 1.5) that I don't even know where to begin...any pointers?
Well, I just completed my first big cooking day (which turned into an entire weekend due to relatives visiting, kids, etc)...I didn't follow one of your provided months due to food allergies, but did quite a bit and it's such a good feeling to know that this week might be a little less chaotic :) Thanks!
Random Question of the Week: What is your go-to salad dressing flavor?
I'm baking bread for the first time by hand (okay maybe the KitchenAid is helping). Wish me luck!
Okay, first attempt at bread making not so successful. :( I think my liquid was too hot. I will try again tomorrow. . .(it is a family recipe I'm trying to document).
getting ready to make lemon raspberry muffins, pizza croissants, and hamburger loaf! This will be my first time cooking in bulk!! These are things I know my family WILL eat so I am doing a "trial" run with these! :-)

The Super Bowl of food blogging is getting to meet and be interviewed by celebrity chefs, here is one of my moments: http://onceamonthmom.com/cooking-connections-can-assist-you-with-your-menu-plan-monday-and-a-look-at-my-mpm/

Our adventures at Cedar Point Castaway Bay and a discount code so you can enjoy yourself too! http://onceamonthmom.com/things-i-love-thursday-castaway-bay-cedar-point/
To say this day has been "rough" is a bit of an understatement - no power most of last night so I had to sleep with the 13 mo to keep her warm. Then we had to be at the hospital for outpatient surgery for my 2yo (in an ice storm). Next, 2 blog giveaways went off instead of 1. . .and I haven't been near my blog all day *sigh* - I'm about to pass along the links to those giveaways in just a moment so don't miss out!
My day just keeps getting better. I just found out I won a Nestle USA Valentine Cookie Kit that I registered for BlissDom Conference. Perhaps I should run out and grab a lottery ticket. . .or hang out with Deals For Dayton more often (she is the winning-est person I know!
Between try to "teach" myself Stumble Upon and playing with the new Facebook Fan Page settings, I have spent a good portion of my day on social media. . . what have you spent your "spare" time doing?
I'm curious - which bloggers/brands Facebook Fan Pages do you frequent most often. Why?
Okay, let's be honest here - What do you watch the Super Bowl for more A. The game or B. The commercials?
Breakfast or snack, whip these up for or w/the kids 4 Valentine's Day: http://bit.ly/iaKWPO
We were suppose to go to the Children's Museum but were thwarted by this mornings snow. Instead, we spent the morning cooking together. Isaac (2yo) helped me make Homemade Blueberry Pop Tarts (http://onceamonthmom.com/freezable-recipe-homemade-pop-tarts/) and tonight's dinner, Chicken Parmigiana (http://onceamonthmom.com/chicken-parmigiana/)
Does your breakfast look this good? (And these are on the DIET menu!) http://onceamonthmom.com/egg-casserole-cups/
It's the kind of day that while you are on hold for a service call (that just boggled your mind), your child wakes up & NEEDS a bottle, the UPS man stops by and needs a signature at that very moment, you try desperately to be quiet so the other toddler doesn't awaken and then the UPS man knocks again. Still on hold. Did I mention there were several flights of stairs also involved. *sigh* How is your day going?
I'm so excited to share the new February Menus. Those of you that resolved to stay healthier or "diet" in the new year, is the DIET Once A Month Mom menu helping you to stay on track? http://onceamonthmom.com/diet-february-2011-oamm-menu-oamc-freezer-cooking-bulk-cooking-power-cooking/
If you can eventually get out this week and you have Bi-Lo near you Vanderbilt Wife just informed me they have tilapia B1G1 free this week! Perfect for either of the OAMM menus.

b'Did you know? \nBy 1921, William Barnickel\xe2\x80\x99s Tret-O-Lite business had outgrown his initial manufacturing plant, so he built a new one in Webster Groves, Missouri. The new facility had six times the capacity of the old plant and was built on a hillside so that raw materials were unloaded from a railroad line on the top of the hill, and the fluids flowed through the plant using the force of gravity. Finished product was loaded on rail cars at the bottom of the hill.\n\nIn 1922, the company sold 10,815 drums of Tret-O-Lite demulsifier, representing a recovery of 50 million barrels of oil from produced oil/water emulsion. In 1923, Mr. Barnickel died at the age of 45, and John S. Lehmann succeeded him as president.'

Bon et bien voil ma recette des malakoffs. J'ai essay de m'approcher au plus de la recette que j'ai dguste en Suisse. http://lesrecettesdebernard.blogspot.com/2011/02/les-malakoffs-vaudois.html
Hi Bernard - It was a pleasure meeting you at Nopa this week ... I'll look for photos of the "special" French carrots on the blog. ;-) Hope you enjoyed the rest of your time in SF. Cheers, Stephanie
 Miam miam ,je vais rgaler ma petite famille grce vous , merci et bonne continuation.
Il est trop fort ce Bernard ! Incroyable site Internet avec des VRAIES Recettes qui marchent et mention spciale pour les photos car on arrive suivre !!! Bravo Bernard, Merci Bernard, Vive Bernard !!!
Aujourd'hui, invitation par le ministre de l'Agriculture de l'Alimentation et de la Pche pour la prsentation du nouveau livre prsent par Jean Pierre Coffe! Un buffet de fruits de mer incroyable. Le reportage sera sur le site!! Un djeuner sympathique avec notre ministre Bruno Le Maire. Je suis reparti avec 7 livres de cuisine offerts!
Du fin fond de son laboratoire-cuisine secret, Bernard l'horrible personnage au rgime qui ne se nourrit que de soupe miso et de rouleaux de printemps, a dcid de mettre profit son plan diabolique. Sa prochaine recette fera grossir toutes les personnes qui la liront! Simple, rapide et dlicieuse, son prochain gteau sera tellement bon qu'il sera impossible d'y rsister! Niark niark niark (rire sadique!)...
beignet de fromage : 500 g de gruyre sal - 3 cuillres soupe de farine - 2 oeufs - 1 2 gousse d'ail - poivre, muscade - 1/2 1 dl de vinaigre - 8 tranches de pain de mie (petits ronds)
Rper le fromage, le mettre dans un saladier et ajouter la farine, les oeufs, l'ail, poivre et muscade, bien mlanger.
Tartiner chaque pain avec la prparation en formant un dme de 3 cm de hauteur. Chauffer de l'huile dans une friteuse 180 degrs et y mettre les tartines cts fromage pour commencer puis les retourner. Egoutter sur un papier mnage et dguster sans attendre. Bon apptit.
pour Malakoff la crme anglaise * Pour la crme anglaise : * 6 jaunes d'oeufs * 110 g de sucre * 3/4 l de lait * 1 gousse de vanille * Pour le Malakoff : * 6 blancs d'oeufs * 60 g de sucre * 110 g de sucre pour le caramel * amandes effiles Prparation pour Malakoff la crme anglaise
Commencez par la crme anglaise en faisant bouillir le lait avec le sucre et la vanille. Versez doucement sur les jaunes d'oeufs en tournant. Remettez feu doux et laissez paissir sans cesser de tourner. Quand la crme nappe la spatule, arrtez la cuisson et passez au chinois au-dessus d'un rcipient froid. Beurrez un moule charlotte. Battez les blancs en neige, pendant la cuisson du caramel. Ajoutez le sucre et continuez fouetter jusqu' ce qu'ils soient fermes. Versez alors le caramel, goutte goutte sur les blancs en continuant fouetter. Versez dans le moule. Laissez refroidir 1 h 30 environ. Dmoulez en trempant le moule quelques secondes dans l'eau chaude. Faites blondir sous le gril du four quelques amandes effiles et parsemez le Malakoff d'amandes effiles.
ps: Placer dans un plat plus grand afin de crer un bain marie. Enfourner pour 15 20 minutes en surveillant attentivement: piquer coeur avec une brochette en mtal et apposer la pique sur le poignet. Quand c'est chaud et sec, la cuisson est finie. Si le malakoff colore trop, le couvrir d'un papier aluminium beurr (sinon ca colle). La cuisson est le point le plus dlicat: trop cuit, il retombera pour former une espce de chewing gum tout plat, pas assez il sera liquide au milieu. Laisser compltement refroidir dans le moule, puis dmouler sur un plat. 
Voici une recette lgre! Enfin me direz vous!! Aprs toutes ces ptisseries nord-africaines, il tait temps de lever le pied sur les recettes un peu lourde. Mais ne vous inquitez pas trop, les "malakoffs" finiront bien par arriver! http://lesrecettesdebernard.blogspot.com/2011/02/les-rouleaux-de-printemps.html

Hallo Rittersport, wrde mich mal ber ne neue Sorte mit Bananengeschmack freuen, knnt Ihr da mal was kreieren! Bananensplit oder so?
Ich muss leider noch immer auf mein feines Ritter Sport Pckchen warten.... dumdidum...
Hallo wir sind viel in Finnland, da gibt es so leckere Schokoladen mit Lakritz, und Blaubeere und Multebeere und Preiselbeerr :-) wre das nicht mal was fr hier?
Warum gibt es eigtl die 40%ige Ritter Sport (in der hellgrnen Verpackung) nicht mehr? Die gab es vorletztes Jahr (?) und verschwand letztes Jahr pltzlich vom Markt. Schade! :( Die war soooo lecker!
Ein kleines Gedicht von mir zum Thema: "Ohne gehts einfach nicht" Eine Tafel Ritter Sport Ist zwingend beim Sonntags-Tatort, denn Schokolade whrend dem Fernsehen lsst den Mrder oft bld da stehen. Und wenn der Mrder dann gefasst, Sind die Polizisten meist geschafft. Ist nicht nur beim Tatort ein Begleiter, macht einen auch beim Lernen Leistungsfhiger. Denn wenn im Frhling die Prfung ansteht, ist so mancher Azubi ohne Ritter Sport schon fasst durchgedreht. Wenn die Prfung dann vorbei, gibts zur Belohnung natrlich eine Sauferei. Denn bestimmte Dinge im Leben, (sollte) man nur einmal erleben. (Verfasser V.S.) Liebe Gre Vroni
und ich will Ritter Rum wieder haben... :-) und den Schokoladen bitte in Mainz...
Bitte bitte... Ritter Sport soll die Winter Kreation "Nuss in Nougatcreme" in ihr Programm aufnehmen!!! :) meine Frau und ich sind schtig :-D
Liebes Ritter Sport Team, ich hab von Kim C. am 20.01. eine Nachricht bekommen, das ich ein Schokopaket gewonnen habe. Allerdings kam bisher nichts und auch keine Antwort mehr von Kim. Knnt ihr mir weiterhelfen? Liebe Grsse Jasmin
Juhuuu ! Superlieben Dank fr fast 2,5 kg Schoki ! 
 Mein Schokopaket ist heute angekommen! Eine schne Valentinstagberraschung. D*A*N*K*E
wo in Hamburg krieg ich noch die Winter Edition "Nuss in Nougatcreme". Danke fr Tipps!
Juchuuu!!! Mein riesen Schokopaket ist heut angekommen... das ist der Hammer!!! vielen Dank dafr!!
Teste grade die neue Sorte Haselnuss-Krokant, seeeehr lecker :) Meine absoluten Lieblingssorten bleiben aber erst mal Pfefferminz, Nougat und Neapolitaner :)
Mein Schokoladenpaket ist immer noch nicht angekommen, liebes Ritter Sport Team!?!
Groen Lob an die Frhlingskreations die 3 Sorten schmecken gut, kommen die auch mal in klein?
Fr heute ideal, aber auch sonst richtig lecker: Die se Valentinsberraschung http://bit.ly/rsvalentin
Juhu! Wann kommt den das nchste Gewinnspiel? Sckeweise Schokolade bitte :-))

So genial! Pnktlich zum Valentinstag kam heute die 2,5kg(!!) - Schokoberraschung bei mir an, ich freu mich ja so auf die neuen Frhlingssorten, alle 3 klingen so lecker!

The Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread is excellent, really worth the extra time for the biga and soaker.
Love the membership because of the recipes - have many excellent meals because of paid membership. But have to say - VERY dissapointed with new "upgraded membership" stance. I have not upgraded as I feel a little jilted. I feel I get to access half (or less) of your database with what was once a full fleged partnership. Now, without warning or explanation, during tough economic times you change the deal. I would prefer you just said, "hey, we need to raise our price. When you renew, it's now $X." I feel teased and dissapointed everytime I log in now. I'm sure you've heard a lot about this, but I tell you because I do respect the relationship I've had with your company. I will hate to not resubscribe, but I really don't know if I will. No one wants to see really awesome recipes they can't access after paying for a membership... I think it was handled poorly. I have been so happy with the site, I would have paid the increase at renewal if handled properly.
Welcome to America, Comrades... the regular membership price is amazingly low for 17 years worth of recipes as well as culinary consumer reporting. I don't have the upgraded membership either, what incentive would there be to buy the cookbooks? Cooks Illustrated does amazing work and does it without advertising. You truly get what you pay for. There's always the public library for those recipes you can't access without the upgrade. 
SNOW DAY!! We want you to stay warm, so here's our free Snow Day Menu, featuring hot chocolate, cookies, beef stew, mashed potatoes and spiced nuts. http://ow.ly/3O8dh

I've now used flax oil to season 2 lots of cast iron, and am pleased with the results--I decided doing an "oven full" made sense, rather than one pot at a time, so I filled both racks. Note: A silicon basting brush was useful when I was working on my cornpone pans and the inside of the lid to my chicken-cooker. I used the "dry down" papertowels to spread the flax oil for the next coating, getting double and triple duty from them. With cold weather outside, heating the kitchen all day with the oven was actually welcome--and I have at least 2 more batches to go!
Carve a chicken like a pro with our quick how-to video: http://ow.ly/3P65w
My family and I love your Best Buttermilk Pancakes recipe, however as huge pancake fans, we'd like to mix it up from time to time. How about a recipe for banana pancakes? Also, gingerbread pancakes. I had the best ever gingerbread pancakes on a trip to VT and honestly, I'd go back for the pancakes alone, they were amazing... Oh, and on a whole other realm of food, how about cabbage rolls?
Never had any particular affinity for Split Pea Soup, but the Cook's Illustrated version was delicious. It will be come a regular addition in this cold weather.
One tip I use about the Clever Coffee Dripper (re:Mar-Apr). For 30oz, I do use a double pour, but drain it into a carafe so the strengths equalize. Then you can pour out two great cups.
cold weather fix: spaghetti and meatballs for a crowd!
BOOO on the Editor's Choice Upgrade!!! C'mon Cook's - It would be so much more palatable if you just raised the subscription price a few bucks if you needed to. Having recipes unavailable is infuriating! I have stopped using the on-line subscription and will not renew - it is a shame. I have been a dedicated magazine and on-line subscriber for many years. I also frequently give subscriptions as gifts. No more.
Brunch Time! Get the recipe: Spanish Tortilla with Roasted Red Peppers http://ow.ly/3QyeW

Loved the milk leftover from your favorite cereal as a kid? Now it's an ingredient in some specialty cocktails: http://ow.ly/3RfcU
I made the old-fashioned chocolate layer cake which calls for all-purpose flour. I thought about substituting cake flour. The cake was good, but not as light as I would like. Should all-purpose ever be substituted with cake flour in a cake recipe or should cake flour only be used when called for? Thank you.
I would love to see a review of deli-style meat slicers. And a best recipe for Chicago-style Italian Beef Sandwiches. The two would go well together.
is there nutrition information anywhere on the website for the recipe's?
Just made your Tiramisu recipe from Fall 2007. WOW! So easy, so good. Got rave reviews from all the women I made it for. 
Another thing I made recently is your vodka pastry crust. I made pasties and then froze them pre-cooking. I thaw and cook them and the crust is still perfect!
Made Black Pepper Bacon Buttermilk Biscuits tonight. Great technique! 
I get tired of hunting through cookbooks and recipe boxes for my favorite recipes. So whenever I find a recipe that is a real keeper, I laminate a copy and tape it to the inside of my kitchen cabinet doors. Each door has it's own theme-baked goods, appetizers, soups, etc. So I never have to spend time searching. Just open the door and scan my favorite recipes for what will work best for that day. Also with this system I can quickly look up ingredients for my weekly shopping list. 
Question on the Whole-Wheat Sandwich Bread from Mar 2011 issue. If we keep our homes well below 70 (ummm say 58), how should we go about warming up the dough so that it reaches 75 ?
Also, I'm blaming Cooks Illustrated for making it okay to have a box of wine in my fridge "for cooking" Little did I know that boxed wines have improved geometrically over the last few years. Now thanks to you guys, I have a wine tap of sauvignon blanc in my fridge and no willpower.

Thank you for your German Chocolate Sheet Cake recipe... my birthday boy loves it, and so do I. It's nice and moist, not dry and crumbly like a lot of cakes are -- and just the right amount of frosting!
I've been a vegetarian for 20 years and a _CI_ subscriber since the mid 90s. The new issue arrived today and is the first in my memory from which I can use a large proportion of the recipes. Thanks! Would love to see more like this one.
Kimball, usually love your editorials, but this month's is unimaginative idiocy picked from Jeff Foxworthy's dustbin. Do better next time. 
I am really disappointed in the quality of the newsletters. Once upon a time these contained great tips, recipes, and news - now they are little more than another place to shill the latest cookbook or product. Example - I clicked on the promising sounding "A Healthy Start: Whole-Grain Baked Goods", only to find that it took me to another cookbook to purchase. In the SAME newsletter, yet ANOTHER cookbook was advertised (slow cooking revolution). At least include a sample recipe! As a long time subscriber I am really disappointed. I also own most of their cookbooks which have become repetitive and which duplicate recipes across titles, AND I subscribe to the website, which in theory gives me access to the editors cookbook collection (except for the new titles). Sad to see such a great institution become just another franchise.
Tried the multi-day flax oil cast iron seasoning with a friend. Had fun, but seasoning didn't "take" for either of us. Even with 5 rounds! Where did we go wrong?
Made the Steamed Chinese Dumplings (Shu Mai) as an early Valentine's Day dinner for my husband. (We are both huge dim sum fans.) One word: heaven. Great job again, CI. 
I have a subscription to your magazine and just love it, I loved it so much I gave a gift subscription to my step-daughter... I was wondering if you might be able to maybe include a gluten free recipes from time to time. My other step-daughter has a gluten allergie and I would love to make her some great homecooked meals however 90% have gluten in them and would love it if you could give us some great recipes.
Think a box of chocolates sounds cliche on Valentine's Day? Not these. Chocolates for beer-lovers, the lactose-intolerant, and even hipsters: http://ow.ly/3UXcn
I just got the entire Annual Library last week and can't wait to go thru all 18 years! My husband and I just LOVE the magazine. Just the other day, he said he can't believe the dishes coming out of our kitchen lately. It has become our bible for cooking! Just re-heated "Saute Chicken with Tomato-Capers- Basil sauce (1993 or1994) (dinner from Sat.) and the office wishes I had brought enough for everyone! 
I wish there was a way to post Cook's Illustrated recipes to my fb. It seems very unfriendly that I cannot share my delicious dinners with everyone. At least, give the recipe title and a photo.... if not the actual recipe. .... Just a thought. 
Filet Mignon? Now how about we wrap that in Bacon? (Let's call this a once-in-a-while treat).
How does one make a chewy rather than crispy cookie? I know you addressed this with brownies last year and it had something to do with the fat ratios. Have you done the same with cookies?
Don't know what you're making for dinner tonight? How about Poached Salmon with Herb and Caper Vinaigrette? http://ow.ly/3YiIE
Just wanted to share these behind-the-scenes photos with you. In making our newest cookbook, "Slow Cooker Revolution," we had to construct a slow cooker wall so that our kitchen wouldn't short out. http://ow.ly/3YmjA
Hi Cook's Illustrated! Question: in the current cook's magazine, you have a recipe for pastry cream for the boston cream pie. You have another recipe for pastry cream from earlier. Which is better? The one with milk and cornstarch or the one with half-and-half and flour? Thanks!
Once one uses dried beans as pie crust weights, can they be used/cooked up or are they shot?
Making pasta this weekend? Here are tips on how to match pastas shapes with sauces. http://bit.ly/e64j9E
How long have you been here on facebook Cook's Illustrated? I can't believe I just found you!
Ok Cook's Illustrated, I'm going all in with your website and iPhone app. No one out there sync the shopping list from their website to the phone app so I guess I will just have to build my shopping list on the phone. I would love to see a seemless website to phone setup by someone. From recipes, to weekly meal plan, to an editable shopping list that would then sync to the phone (sorted by store isle of course.) But I guess that is still a dream...
Jus made Beef Tacos for dinner last night! I'll never buy taco mix again. Not only did they taste out of this world, but I can control the sodium in them!
We're having company over for a late lunch, early dinner on Saturday. 2 adults and 2 toddlers. Can you suggest some recipes that are kid friendly but appealing to adults as well?
The flourless chocolate cake recipe is FANTASTIC! (pulled from my Baker's Illustrated cookbook, but also can be found on cooksillustrated.com). I've never made one before and the result was exactly what I wanted. Rave reviews poured in from the recipients of this simple labor of love. Thanks Cook's!
Today lunch was the Spaghetti al Limone...very tasty
Happy Brunch! Here's our recipe for Blueberry Scones: http://ow.ly/3Z8Ng
I love the website and I have subscribed for the past 3 years. HOWEVER - I'm getting pretty aggravated with all of the "new" charges - I can't access "editor's choice" recipes unless I pay extra - pretty soon all of the recipes will be editor's choice -- so just charge one fee and give me total access. Geez. Very frustrating.
I just made the "Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies" Wow. The name fits!!! Will never make the Tollhouse recipe again. 
Happy Presidents' Day! It's the perfect day to celebrate George Washington with a new take on an old favorite, Apple Pie: http://ow.ly/3ZkuD
Thank you so much for the Whole Wheat Bread recipe in the new issue. Now I have light and fluffy wheat bread instead of bricks.
Most butternut squash recipes require you to turn the odd-shaped gourd into an even dice. Sound daunting? Not if you use the test kitchens preferred method. http://ow.ly/3ZnQa
Quick Tip: Cutting brownies neatly can be tricky because half the crumbs end up sticking to the knife. Instead of using a serrated or chef's knife, use a plastic knife. It glides easily through even the stickiest brownies. Got a Quick Tip to share? Post it here, and if we choose to publish in Cook's Illustrated Magazine, you will receive a complimentary subscription.
I noticed that the chili recipe calls for lager-is their a non-alcoholic suggestion?
Can Cook's Illustrated recipe for Classic Irish Soda Bread be made into bread rolls? Are there any adjustments to be made (baking time? oven temp?)? I'm thinking breaking up the dough into rolls and baking them in muffin pan. Good or bad idea?
Does anyone know when Cook's Illustrated will review the round cake pans again? Last time was I think 2005.
 Looked all over the site for a jelly roll recipe and couldnt find one. If you (or anyone) have it could you please refer me to it? Cant believe you dont have one, it must be me that doesnt now how to look...Im specially interested in the PERFECT jelly roll mix...Thanks!! (Really, it HAS to be me, I just cant believe there isnt one...maybe its like, completely pass or retro or something...)
I made fluffy pancakes (from The Best Recipe), and they turned out great. I like them with the "lemon juice + milk" tip if you don't have buttermilk on hand, as the pancakes turn out very nicely, with a hint of lemon scent. Delightful!
We have to use sourdough bread due to my husband's allergies. I used the CI recipe from the Holiday Baking Issue and the loaves came out beautifully even on the first try. Much, much better than other recipes I have tried. Thanks so much!
Yum, yum, yum... just made the Broccoli-Cheese soup from the March / April magazine. WOW! the Flavors just exploded. And I felt so healthy eating it!
Toy Story 3 Bean Chili? True Cheese Grits? Harry Potter and the Death by Chocolate Chip Cookies? SeriousEats rounds up some Oscar puns... can you think of better ones?
beef tacos with home-made shells
Hummus
Triple Chocolate Mousse Cake - this was amazing!
Herb-crusted beef tenderloin and potato latkes -- two of my favorite CI recipes
Chicken with broccoli, ziti, and parm -- slightly modified CI recipe -- love this one-pot meal!
i feel silly...i have posted these pictures on all three fb pages...i couldnt remember which this recipe came from =X this is croissant dough!
layers and layers of butter!
I made your New York-Style Crumb Cake last night and it tastes fantastic. Thanks for another great recipe!
Great for book groups and just reading by yourself.
I just posted about your chewy brownies on my blog - they are absolutely incredible! Seriously, the best brownies I've ever had. Thanks so much for a great recipe!
Just read my new issue, with lots of great recipes, as usual. I was surprised Jif came out on top for peanut butter, though. Ok, but nothing special. I don't usually rave about foods like this - it's just pb, after all - but Parkers Farm natural pb is way better than anything in the CI taste testing. Refrigerated, doesn't separate, creamy, not chalky, deep roasty peanut flavor and nothing but peanuts and salt.
I just made your "Perfect Chocolate Chips Cookies" and substituted peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips. Amazing!
Last weekend I made Slow-Roasted Pork Shoulder with Peach Sauce (from the September/October 2010 issue), along with a Wild Rice Pilaf (using the recipe from the ATK Family Cookbook, except that I used fresh-frozen cranberries instead of dried ones) and Carrots with Honey-Ginger Glaze (my own recipe, though following the basic procedure for Glazed Carrots from the Family Cookbook). Great roast... moist and flavorful.
A couple nights ago I made the Spaghetti with Mushroom and Tomato Sauce recipe from the current issue. It was fast and easy, and I found it absolutely delicious. Here you see some served up along with a serving of Caesar salad (the bagged kind).

Just made the Blueberry Scones last night! My 5 year old wanted to have one for dinner but I told him we had to wait for breakfast!
gas grilled steak cooked per your directions...must say turns out perfect 100% of the time
your recipe for chicken cacciatore is the one I like best. I use breast meat, also. I just cook it different than the thigh meat..turns out great! Thanks
This month's potato gallette. Yum.

The Spaghetti al Limone was fantastic!
Maple Glazed Pork-Roast w/Glazed Carrots
Quick Tip: Use a cheese plane to peel the skin off of and slice cucumbers. It works well as a peeler and is a great way to get thin, even slices for salads and sandwiches.

I realize I won't win any photo contests with this failed attempt at the Spanish Tortilla, but thought I might at least get some sympathy :-). But I'm happy to share the wisdom I gained: don't use a pan with too tall a side, or the omelet will not "slide" out. It kind of folds over on itself and breaks apart. But if you eat it in dimly lit candlelight, it still tastes great!

Prepared these awesome Pan-Fried Pork Chops from the Nov/Dec 10 issue of CI. I didn't think a boneless pork chop could be so moist and flavorful. Perfection! Thanks CI!

Just got out of studio recorded some background vocals.. Fun night, did really good. Wrote a killer song today as well!
Hi Kristy! Do you remember your first grade class at Des Moines elementary? I was the student teacher for your class that year. I saw a photo of you on American Idol that was taken in our classroom. I was so excited to see you. I spoke to your mom on the phone after that to find out when you would be in Seattle. Mrs. (Jan) Anderson and I were hoping to hear you sing and say "hi". I don't know if you remember me but I wanted to congratulate you for all of your accomplishments. By the way, my eleven year old daughter and I love your album!

 01:00 ( 09:00 ) Stay tuned today at 01:00 pm (UAE timing) to learn how to make different types of bread at home, call us on air or write your comment on the episode
New Points meal for two (though it could feed an army I think!) Cauliflower and cheddar soup with whole wheat cheesy crackers made from pita bread. It basically was potato soup, just without the potatoes, and adding cauliflower. It tasted EXACTLY the same...but surprisingly kind of spicy! Husband loved it, I liked it.
Broccoli Chicken Fettuccine with strawberry spinach salad This was a good one! Tasted like chicken fettuccine alfredo, but with mushroom soup and milk instead of the fatty cream sauce. Salad was yummy too! I would say the 2 year old gave it a 4/5 rating. He liked the noodles, chicken, and strawberries. LOL Typical. (From Walmart New Points for 2...this one is definitely for more than two people! I would say it was about 5 servings. The portion in the picture is large, but that's because its my husband's lol )
The Blueberry French Toast from last week was amazing! The best meal we've had. Saved the extras for breakfast the next morning. It reheated just fine! YUM-O!
Did anyone find the Ham Stroganoff from this week's low fat family plan on the salty side? We LOVE e-mealz but we seem to be finding some of the recipes quite salty. Is there a plan that suited for low-sodium?
Are there any plans to list nutritional information with the meals, especially calories? We love emealz but are trying to lose a few pounds by controlling portion sizes and counting calories. We aren't interested in Weight Watchers Points, Low fat...etc....just want to count calories!
Just joined! Can't wait to start using the program :) Homeschooling my 2 oldest boys takes a lot of time....Dinner is one less thing I have to plan for now :)
took my first shopping trip with my e-mealz list today - I felt so prepared!!! Thank you! We had the tuna macaroni salad on the new points plan - yummy & very filling. I feel great knowing we had a healthy family meal.
UGH!! I am on the fence about doing this. I would really like some feed back, from the sample menus I couldn't tell a whole lot, is there a good variety, can meats be subbed? I am not a chicken eater and prefer beef and pork kind of deal. Are there any draw backs? Its ok to PM me to my inbox if you want. 
I just joined and am looking forward to shopping with my list for the first time this week! I'm doing the WW New Points Any Store for 2. Glad I don't have to think about what's for dinner anymore!
Have been using E-mealz [Lowfat Any Store for 2 plan] for a month now and I have to say just about every night my 6 year old daughter says --- Oooh! This looks yummy! --- and if she doesn't say it looks yummy then when she tastes it she says 'yummmmmm!'. My 3 yr old on the other hand, well she's three, but once we make her try it she usually eats a good amount on her own. ;) Thanks!
I just joined! Is the new ww menu using the new points + program?
Turkey burgers with swiss - yummy 
Been doing e-mealz for a month. We spent $1000 dollars less this month. I have NO CLUE other than using the menu, how we managed this. My only thought is I have a mission while shopping instead of browsing what to buy. I get done in about 40 mins and then I leave the store. We're also eating out MUCH LESS. Thank You E-MEALZ
What would one suggest out of all the meal plans which one would be better Low Carbs or Low Fat?
can't get to my plan this morning. Receiving the "forbidden" message. Any ideas what is going on?
I have a guestion as I am a new member of e-mealz and don't quite have it all figured out...I am on the Wal-Mart plan that is released on Thursdays. Does that coincide with the sales that are current on that Thursday and expire that Saturday? Or does that week's plan coincide with the upcoming sales prices that start on Sunday?
With my daughter away at college, it is just my hubby and me. I was able to buy a week's worth of groceries last week for $50 thanks to E-Mealz. And, I did not have to re-visit the grocery store again until the following week. Thank you, E-mealz, for simplifying my life and helping our monthly budget.
I normally spend $275 on my two week shopping trip and spend hours in the store. I went yesterday with my E Mealz list in hand. I spent $188 for two weeks, got more meals and cut my shopping time IN HALF. Thank you, Thank you E Mealz. I am going to share this with all the other overbooked, underpaid mom's I know. :-) 
I don't have any problem with gluten and would prefer to have all recipes with no processed food in it. I like chicken, fish and some red meat (lean cuts). Which plan is best for my husband and I?
Can someone please post a picture of the Broccoli, ham, and cheese pastry from the Publix family plan. I don't know why, but I had a hard time with it. I even got more help from e-mealz feed back. I just put it in the oven and it's just a big mess. It sounds so good. I don't know why my mind can't figure this out!
Just want to thank you for a super successful 1st week for my family! Successful is defined by whether my kids will eat what I make them - and they ate every meal! You've got a big fan here! Looking forward to Sunday and next week's recipes!
I just downloaded my first week's menus, and I'm curious to see how E-Mealz works for me?!
I plan to join but not sure if I should use "any store" or Wal-mart. I am able to shop at the commissary on base and do so most of the time. I mention Wal-mart only because their prices seem to be less than some of the other stores in my area. Typically, commissary prices are a little less than Wal-mart. Which would you suggest? 
Are your recipes for weight watchers up to date with the new weight watchers plan and points values? 
I just joined the WW new points plan but after looking at the full week I'm thinking (for my kids & husband) maybe I should have just done the regular family plan and made changes to the meals to make them healthier. Are the regular plans very high fat, high calorie, etc. plans?
After a month, I am sorry to say I won't be using e-mealz anymore. I'm subscribed to the low fat plan but other than using low fat options of some things - these meals aren't all that healthy! Particularly when it comes to sodium! At first I was just adjusting the recipes to reduce the amount of processed foods but decided that's wasting my time when this is supposed to be a time saver! Any plans to make healthier options? I have subscribed to a different service and am shocked at the difference in their plans! Yours is a great concept but not for us anymore.
Just joined today. Went shopping for the first weeks meals and it was so simple to shop with that wonderfully put-together grocery list. The meals look fantastic and I'm so excited that I don't have to figure the Weight Watcher points any longer. I hope this works for our family. 
We made the hamburger pie tonight. I thought it was pretty good.
Just joined! My husband and I went to see Dave Ramsey last night in Nashville and saw the ad in the booklet he gave us. I'm a new working mother and my husband has been in charge of the making dinner since I have went back to work! So tonight is the last night for take out!!!!!....going to do our shopping tomorrow! 
I have to be on a low-salt diet for a medical condition, so I was wondering if you would ever consider making a low-salt meal plan?
I am a mother of 4 children and I am expecting a baby in August. I also babysit 3 children! This has been awesome! I don't have to wonder what I am making for dinner. All of the recipes are so easy and taste great!
Just tried to pull up this weeks menu for Aldi Family Meal plan and got a blank page. Can someone check on it?
What on earth is "baking mix" It's on the any store for two list this week...I see and have heard of many other mixes but not 'baking mix'
I haven't started my subscription yet - but I'm intrigued - such a low price for membership and there is such flexibility. If I didn't like a planned meal I would easily be able to eliminate the shopping list items and substitute another meal.
Well, I just joined and am very excited about the headache of meal planning to be taken care of for me. I wasn't sure of which plan to choose as I have been trying to count calories yet still please the family. I did choose the regular family plan with the idea that portion size could be just as beneficial, for now. However, I am a homeschool mom of 4 and lunch can tend to get rather frustrating as well. So, my question is have you ever considered preparing a lunch menu, something quick, and on the healthy side?
HELP HELP HELP I need the recipe to the low carb for 2 mushroom and steak with garlic and nutty green beans. I left my list at the grocery store and having dinner guest. in an hour. help!! 
I am single and live alone. I have signed up for points plus at Wal Mart - I know I can just halve or quarter the recipes for smaller portions but do you ever post meal plans for people who only cook for themselves
I'd love to see less meat substitutes on the veggie plan. 
I'm so super relieved that I never have to ask my husband, "What do you want for dinner?" just to hear him say, "I don't know." Saving me time, money and SANITY. Thanks so much!
I don't currently use emealz, but it looks great! My hubby and I are expecting our first child in March and I'm looking for anything to make our lives simpler (more simple?). What percentage of these meals would you say are "freezer friendly" so I could make them ahead and have them ready for the week?
Just getting started 
Just starting!!! 
Just heard about you through Blissfully Domestic. Looks like a great time and money saver!
just starting but almost everything taste good so far
Thank you so much for making this Momma's life easier. My 6 and 4 year olds ate Cobb salad pitas last night. Something I never thought my son would eat and neither of them could thank me enough for the wonderful meal :)
Question about recipe on vegetarian plan....in your recipe for cucumbers, mozzarella & tomatoes it says '1/2 vinegar'....is that supposed to be 1/2 cup, tbsp, etc.? 
We just signed up for this tonight and are so excited!!! 
Blissfully Domestic sent me -- I think I might need to do this thing. The Low Carb looks scrumptious!
Sent by Blissfully Domestic, and with a background in nutrition coaching, i am excited to learn more about you!
Just signed up and am SO excited. You are the answer to my major kitchen problems. Thank you for offering the new WW PP info too!
My husand and I are finishing week two of using your plans. We LOVE it. Such a life saver. Plus many meals we are able to feed our one year old as well. What a wonderful blessing.
Just started the first week.. this is a fabulous thing! I don't have to stress out about dinner anymore!!
I use the WW PP Any Store plan and was worried how my picky kids would take to the cauliflower in this week's cauliflower cheddar soup, so I played sneaky chef! I made it as directed but decided to puree the cauliflower (after steaming it), and add several shakes of bacon bits to the simmering soup. I then presented it as cheesy baked potato soup. They had no idea...and loved it!
Been using the plan for about a month and half. so much easier then asking the family to help me out. I use the 7 day Lowfat Walmart plan. I usually cook 4 or 5 days a week, so we have a little room to play with. Makes coming home at night much easier. Love it and have recommended to several friends.
I made the Crust-less Spinach Quiche recipe for dinner tonight and my kids LOVED it! They are telling me it is the BEST quiche I've ever made. I've made quiche many different ways and this one was by far the best. Thank you e-mealz! My kids would starve off my cooking if I didn't have something like this that provides kid friendly recipe's. 
I am signed up for the Publix low-fat plan and used to love the recipe. Lately, it appears to be very heavy on canned goods, beef and pork and lacking on fresh vegetables and variety in recipes. Can anyone suggest a plan that would be suitable for two kids as well as health conscious parents? 
I made the beef marinara soup tonight! Double YUM! Loved it!
We are 5 meals in (Walmart Family) and every single one has been a HUGE hit. Hubby, teenage boy, and even 3 year old are fans. I'm a pretty picky eater myself and so far I've liked the meals too! Can't wait to make the Rio Grande Soup tonight. Most astonishing, we've eaten at the table every single night. Like a REAL FAMILY. Thank you, E-Mealz! Thank you, Jonathan Acuff!
Just signed up the other day and bought went shopping with my list. Now I have great meals for the week. This looks awesome!
So you can't just sign up for a month to see if you like it? And just pay the $5? Or am I missing that option?
My husband and I are trying to eat healthier and lose some weight (with exercise too). I just signed up and chose the "low fat" plan. Is this the best option or should I have gone with one of the points meal plans? 
I'm thinking of trying emealz, but have three questions...1. Do you actually save money on the any store plan since it doesn't involve coupons and store specials (unless you research on your own)? And 2. The only store on the meal plans in my area is walmart...what is the quality of their meats and fruits and veggies? I'm concerned from a health-organic view point... And 3. Is there any type of organic meal plan? Thanks to anyone who has any insight into these questions....I love this idea! 
Do I have to pre-select a store and meal plan or will I have access to all the plans available each week if I subscribe? We use different stores each week and we would probably need to rotate between veggie, low-fat, and other plans to meet needs of all the different family members. It woudl be nice to review the different plans each week to see which one suits our family best.
Dear E-Z mealz, just wanted to let you know on dinner #2 for the baked swordfish, you say to use a thinly sliced onion, but never mention onions in the preparation. Just an FYI.
I would LOVE LOVE LOVE a New Points plan for 2 that was for Ralph's sales. The regular option is not very healthy plans...but you do not cover any stores that are in Southern Cali. (We do not have super Walmart in San Diego.) I just joined the New Points for walmart for 2, just for a price comparison on the print out...but would be GREAT if you could run one for the Ralph's sales...I would be the first customer!
Chicken & Sausage gumbo was surprisingly good tonight. I'm not a gumbo type person but the ingredients sounded good, sans the okra, and of course, it was so easy to make. I substituted the okra for broccoli. So, no, not a true gumbo, but nonetheless, a happy, satisfied couple! :)
made your red velvet cupcakes for a party i attended saturday night and they were a hit. thanks for posting it! :)
Just made the Chicken and Wild Rice soup on the points plus plan and it was amazing. Thanks e-mealz this is the 4th week for us and we have so loved many of the meals and our kids like them too.
Thanks for going through all the work to update the Points plan to match the new WW Points Plus change. So far we all love the meals. I guess you all are not near a HEB like down here in Texas...they can be cheaper than Walmart at times.
It would be awesomely great if the meals for 2 had 7 meals instead of 5!
on the Aldi's Plan. Make the Pizza Log and it was delicious but wasnt big enuf for our Family of 4. Will make 2 next time. Just made the Chix and Stuffing in the Crockpot and OH its soooooo good!!
I just signed up for the family Walmart plan, I really hope they do not have fish on every weeks plan. 
Just did my first e-mealz plan shopping today. I spent $28 for healthy dinners for 2-3 people! It said it should have been $44...but I use coupons, plus stockpile on certain items when I can get the free with coupons, so a few of the items I already had. Coupons are awesome...kind of bummed that E-mealz site gave them such a bad rap...but I still like your meal plans;)
Just signed up and going to shop today. Not fond of the fruit mixed with meat thing, but I can skip that recipe. Hope this works for us! My husband is gone with the military and I'm trying to get into making myself meals instead of those fast food places! Also, is it possible to change from one plan to another one? Once he's home I want to switch meal plans if possible. 
I made the Red Velvet Valentine's cupcakes yesterday for my husband (red velvet is his favorite). He took some to the office today and just called to say they are a HUGE hit! Some of the best cupcakes I have ever made! Thanks for the recipe!
This is nuts. Last night was my first e-mealz dinner. And today I have been SOO excited to make dinner all day. What's wrong with me??? LOL Its almost like a game now. I have a recipe, and the ingredients, but have no idea what the finished product will look or taste like! Thanks for making me actually look forward to fixing dinner;) 
Made the shepherd's pie from last week's Ralphs plan and my family is already asking when we can have it again! E-Mealz absolutely ROCKS! My husband thinks I'm a super woman in the kitchen! 
grilled portabella sandwiches and soup tonight were delicious!!!!!
Oh Where have you been all my life. A member of our Mom's Group mentioned your site last week and just got around to checking it out. I knew right away this will work for me. I bought the Aldi's plan and can't wait to start!!!
I just came across your website a few days ago and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!! After signing up, I emailed your link to all my family and my mom took the info to her weight watchers meeting! I feel like I want to shout this from the mountain tops haha I cant believe I am just not hearing about your site! 
thanks to e-mealz, my family and i have sat down to dinner, in the kitchen, TOGETHER, every night, for the last month! we are on the low fat walmart plan and have lost weight this month by only making the change over to emealz. while the weight loss has been a great "perk", the family time spent around the table each night is what really counts!!! thanks for making this possible!!!
Question, on this weeks New Point System Walmart plan, the Chicken & Wild Rice Soup says 6 serving, do you have any idea how many cups = 1 serving? it sure seems like a lot, which I am not complaining. We fixed it Monday night and loved it! Once again, even my boys liked it! They are eating healthy and don't even know it and the scale is showing a difference too!! Thanks for any help on this, or if there is somewhere I should go to look for more details, please lead me there...
Just made the Salisbury Steak from the low-fat menu - SOOO Yummy!!
Made Sheppard's pie last night and my 1year old LOVED it. She ate two servings!
Saved $40 on my food budget this week at PUBLIX. And my husband loved helping me shop, he said it was like a money saving scavenger hunt, lol... It paid for its self 6 months over and then some. And we have been introduced to a new way to eat broccoli, broccoli slaw... I would advise it to any couple or growing family. >^..^<
I made the Chicken Porfolios last night. MY FAVORITE so far. They were so yummy and easy. But I have a couple recommendations. Squish out the cresent rectangles to make more of a square, then you can fit more filling and seal better. And in the instructions, say to use a cookie sheet. I used a glass 9x13 and the dough stayed gooey where they touched. I had to separate them some and bake an additional 10 mins. On a cookie sheet they'd be golden and wonderful all around. 
My husband was VERY skeptical about me using e-mealz...and 3 weeks into it, he told me last night how much he is enjoying it! We have the low-fat family plan and make 5 of the 7 meals. So far, this week has been 3 for 3! Thank you!
I just started e-mealz, I fixed my first meal last night. It was so great! My family loved the food! It was incredibly fast & easy! But, I was surprised at the amount of out of season produce involved. Do most of you live in a different climate? I'm on the Walmart new points family plan. Cantaloupe? Yellow squash and zucchini? -- even strawberries are just starting to show-up on store shelves. I went to two stores, one had no zucchini and the other had just a couple of shriveled ones. Wouldn't it be more economical to stick with frozen or canned or in season produce? 
When you are calculating the cost on the print-out sheets...are you calculating that you purchase just the one item of the BOGO?
I just found out about this from Blissfully Domestic!!
Just wondering if you'd consider adding out local grocery store to your list...H-E-B. They are all over Texas and have great deals. 
When cooking the Peach Pork Chops...do you broil on high or low? 
This site sounds wonderful ! Just found out about you from Blissfully Domestic!
Just wanted to let you know that I am in LOVE! We had our 1st night of e-mealz last night and it was delish. We had Tilapia tacos from the low-carb menu. YUM YUM!
I am making the Balsamic Roasted Chicken and it calls for a 5 lb chicken to be roasted for 15 min and then baked for 40 min, but since I have a big family I had to buy a 11 lb chicken..Question: for how long do I roast it and bake it? Thank you so much!! 
I have been on the Publix Meal plan for the last 3 weeks. I love the meals and how easy they are to prepare. However, my husband and I are on a low carb diet (not NO carbs, just low carbs). The meals have been so good that we have been cheating on our diets! I am thinking of changing to the Low Carb Any Store plan, but I am not sure my kids will like the meals. Is anyone else with kids on the Low Carb Plan?
Would you be willing to give a rough average points values for your WW points plus meals (including non-veggie sides)? iow, do they average 8 points+, 11 points+, 15 points+, etc. per meal (on average that is). Thank you. This will help me determine if I will resubscribe to emeals since the new WW program came out.
This might be a silly question but I just started using the new points WW family menu for Walmart and I will not make it to Walmart this week - I'm going to have to use another grocery store - aside from the cost being different will it be a problem? The points should still be the same right?!?
Oh. My. GOODNESS! I made the Red Velvet Cupcake recipe you posted...and it is like a little nibble of heaven!
I"m using the regular family walmart menu right now but was thinking i wanted to switch to the low fat menu instead but my biggest concern is it having foods that my very picky eaters (kids and hubby) won't eat. is it that much of a difference in types of foods or is it just different in the way it is prepared? the sample menu looks real good. I'm just worried about switching and finding out its not real kid or picky eater friendly (for my family) and not being able to switch back...
I am currently on the "any store" plan, but I would like to be on a plan for a specific store... Kroger would be great but I see that it is only based on sales in certain areas... I live in Arizona, does this mean the Kroger plan would not be a good choice for me? I try to avoid Wal-Mart so I would not choose to do my weekly shopping there. Any suggestions/comments might be helpful. Thanks!
Any chance for a points plus Ralphs plan? Here in California we dont have any of the other stores other than walmart. I'm using the any store but I would like one the goes with the sales. Love using e-mealz but my grocery bill has gone way up.
I've got a WW Points Plus (shop anywhere) question: the shopping list usually calls for 1 1/2lbs. of chicken per meal. When I shop for chicken at my grocery store, this equals three chicken breasts (not frozen) and I'm trying to feed six. Are the points calculated with 1/2 a chicken breast, is my store serving up gigantic chicken pieces, or is the 1 1/2lbs intended equate to 6 chicken breasts? 
Got a recipe for next week that calls for soy sauce. My son has a soy allergy. Any ideas on what I can use instead?? (maybe nothing?! lol)
I had tried making soups in the past and they were always an epic fail. I love the soups on your meal plan...easy to make, taste delicious, and the fam loves them. Thanks for putting soups on the menu. 
I noticed on the sample menus you guy's tend to utilize a lot of pork...is this typical of the weekly menus once I subscribe? Just trying to get a gauge on how often I'll need to adjust the menu's in regards to the meat? Thanks!
Had the beefy hoppin' John tonight from the low fat wal-mart menu. It was wonderful. Because my husband is not an onion fan, I softend the onion, celery and garlic in a little evoo, then continued cooking with the ground beef. 
Just went shopping for our first week of e-mealz! YAY DH wasn't so excited as it took us a little longer to hunt down everything on the list. I"m thinking that next week i'm going to cut the list in half and make it into a competition to see who can find everything first...lol 
Any possiblity of a price chopper or Hyvee list for Kansas soon?
I read somewhere on here that you plan the meals based on the store's sale ads. I have the Walmart plan, and I believe their prices generally stay the same. Is that correct? I'm hoping so, because it usually takes me about 2 weeks to get through the 7 meals, so I will always be a little off as far as the menu dates go. I'd hate to be buying meals that were only good prices the week BEFORE I actually get them....
After going and seeing Dave Ramsey yesterday, I came across your link on his website. I have looked at the sample menu's for the family of 4 from Walmart and my concern is that as a mother of 2 very active in sports, full time employed, the sample meals don't seem to "quick"? My other concern is the ideas on the sample menu's for dinner...my boys aren't wild about salad type meals? Any suggestions?
Am wondering how people feel about The WW points meal menu!?!? Any advice!?
I just subscribed to e-mealz...does anyone know what the letters 'GV' stand for on the grocery list? Is it for generic brand?
I have to admit I am a little disappointed in some of the choices that are made for the menus sometimes. I was shopping today for the Weight Watchers new points for two Walmart menu (with the idea that its healthy, right?) The chicken and rice soup called for two cans of Swanson chunk chicken. Each can has 1,000 mg of sodium in them. Wouldn't a healthier option have been to BAKE some chicken and cut it up? Not to mention the added preservatives. I guess if this were on another list, I would not think it was a big deal...but this is supposed to be a healthier choice list. Just a suggestion for when this recipe is used in the future I guess. I will be baking my own chicken.
I am doing the Publix Menu for Two and Meal 1 is the 3 Cheese Baked Ziti. I'm reading the ingredients and noticed there is no sauce. Is this correct? 
I'm about to make the Red Beans & Rice from WWP menu but realize I don't have cajun seasoning. What's a good easy
Did my first plan shopping tonight. Definitely the most bang for buck ever at Krogers. It is well worth it just to have the meal suggestions and grocery list in the order of the shelves in the store. I love it.
Just joined this weekend and went shopping without having to spend an hour making a menu and grocery list! So excited! Our first two meals were a huge hit with my family. I'm SOLD!
Why does the WW Points plus plan for Publix come out on Thursday instead of Wednesday like the regular Publix for 2? Publix offers a 5% discount on Wednesdays for senior citizens and I can't get the discount if I wait until Thursday to shop. Otherwise, the program is great.
On the quiche recipe with the WW Plus menu, does anyone know why you couldn't use Bisquick-lite instead of the flour/baking powder mix?
Hey Everyone! I just joined E-Mealz today. Loved the shopping list. Made the BBQ meatballs..they were delicious! Even my dd liked them (she's a very picky eater)..can't wait to make the rest of the dinners for this week :) 
Hi Everyone...need to subscribe to this great program...meals based on what is for sale that week! Has meals for Publix and Walmart and for 2 people or 5-6...check it out! Was on the Dave Ramsey Site!!!
Just joined up. I'm in Australia, and was astounded to see that the "family meals" was predominantly prepackaged stuff, with not much in the way of veges. I signed up with the "family meals", and changed within the first 5 minutes to low carb, as that seems to actually contain veges. This weeks recipes look pretty good though, I'm keen to try them!
Has anyone made the Crab Bake? (Wal-mart Low Carb for 2) I recently joined e-mealz ad I was a little disappointed in this! (the other meals have been GREAT) It didn't seem to hold together very well, and my family was not a fan. Just wondering what others reviews on this were?! :) 
I am on the Publix low fat plan and I was not able to print the recipes from 2 weeks ago. Is there any way to get the spices and amounts for the chicken italiano (crockpot) meal? I am not sure if that is what it is called hopefully you will know what I mean. Thanks!
Just joined and I am soooo excited! I don't mind cooking, but the PLANNING sucks! I just printed my first week of meals and they all sound delicious! I'm looking forward to finally giving myself and my daughter healthier meals with more variety for less money!
Just wanted to say, once again, THANK YOU! The meals are delicious and this has made my life so much easier!
The Santa Fe Soup was delicious! We just started using this last week....this week was really our first attempt at some of the recipes! Love it!
This is our 3rd week on the GF Walmart plan, and I was wondering how big of a difference there is in the meals from the Walmart plan to any store plan? The recipes have been tasty, but they do seem a little high in fat/sodium. I am also, besides GF, trying to adhere to a dairy free diet (and so am just picking about 5 meals/wk to modify for dairy free or lower the dairy content)...any possibilities of a plan combining the two in the future?? Sometimes the two go hand in hand... Thanks for simplifying my meal-planning and shopping trips! My husband, 2 year old, and I have been enjoying the meals so far!
Crabbed-topped Salmon is the bomb!!! The crockpot roast and beef stroganoff boat were good also, but the salmon was "WOW!!"
grits/ham crustless quiche was fabulous. My husband is out of town for the week, so the leftovers will be an easy breakfast option. LOVE my e-mealz!!
My husband absolutely loved the sausage hoagies and rice pilaf! We are both in college full time and with 4 children,work, school and church activities.... E-mealz is a blessing!!!
I'm confused about the beef bolognese from last week's any-store low carb plan. I understand the meals are low carb, but It doesn't show eating it ON anything. It's a sauce so it would need to be eaten on something even if that something is not pasta.
Saucy Pork Chops were so yummy. My girls asked if there was jam on top. I would have NEVER chosen to make a meal like this on my own, simmering a sauce for 20 minutes, with 9 different ingredients. I wouldn't have been brave enough. But I did it and I loved it! And I even had the confidence to puree some diced tomatoes as a substitute because Tomato Juice is NOT a staple in this house!!!! :D
I was thinking of changing from the Walmart regular plan to the low carb. I am doing low carb myself and it would make it easier than making two different meals each night. Anyone that is on what does your family think and about how many carbs per serveing?
Someone posted a few weeks ago about Publix charging full price on BOGO items if you only buy one. I talked to a manager at my local Publix in SC...she said most all stores will do the item half price if only purchasing one item. The only state in the southeast she knew of that didn't do them half price is Florida. Just wanted to let you know...
I haven't gotten my subscription yet (tomorrow is payday!) and I was wondering what plan to get. It's just me and my boy friend, but I was thinking about getting the family plan so we'll have leftovers for lunch. I'm also debating getting the WW or low fat plans and not telling him (sounds shady, but I don't want to hear any grumbling about diet food). Do the meals taste "diety" or would he never know the difference?
I just signed up and am so psyched! I absolutely positively hate shopping and cooking with a passion which has led to WAY too much unhealthy and expensive eating out. I've wanted to change for a long time now and hope this plan with be my ticket to freedom. While signing up I read something in the small print (yep I actually read that stuff) about a referral program - refer friends and get your subscription reduced....? I apologize if this question is redundant but I didn't see it anywhere on the discussion board or in the FAQ section of your site. How does the referral program work? 
I am REALLY enjoying e-mealz. I have not been a fan of cooking/planning/etc. It does wonders for my selfesteem to provide such good meals for my family! I do have a question. We're on the family new points any store program.. It's SO pricey.. would the regular family any storeprogram be cheaper at the grocery store?
Just wondering how anyone likes the Vegetarian or the Points Program... looking for a more "diet friendly" program.. & we dont eat beef or pork. So trying to figure out which one to go with. I'm currently on the meal for 2 ... not working for us (we're picky eaters so not E-Mealz fault) Husband wont eat ANYTHING with mayo or sour cream (geez)

Made the Greek Tilapia and rice from the GF Walmart plan (and threw in some baked apples on the side) and it turned out delicious!
I am very interested in starting this to save money on our grocery bill. I have a picky eater due to health reasons which we are working through. Because of this I haven't started but really want to since we are doing Dave Ramsey right now! Any suggestions as to how it might work around his nuggets, fish sticks etc? We would do the Kroger plan -- lots of coupons with it as well. :)
I had a question, On the publix bogo why don't you list the full price? I am new to the list and find it hard to budget because I go over what the list price says because of the bogo..? I know it is half the cost but we still pay full price for that one item in order to the get the other on free.. 
which plan is the one with recipes for meals with protein and lots a veggies, healthier carbs (no white rice or white bread)?
Anyone on the lowfat walmart meal plan? wondering what you thought about the new menu. I normally give all the meals a shot and occasionally substitute but this weeks Im not so sure of. I was thinking of switching to Kroger even though Im in Ohio but I dont see a low fat option. Its funny how its called a low fat plan with all the cheese and dinner rolls it calls for. And what is it about rice? Seems like some of the menus have rice in everything. I have a family of some picky eaters and am not looking for a restrictive diet plan which is why the low-fat family friendly plan was appealing .
Does e-mealz have any plans for those who have their own beef (or poultry) supply? If not, it would be really nice for many small town families that have cattle, but want to save $$ on groceries....or rather save money, period. We have our own beef supply and would like to use e-mealz, but hesitate because of the risk of not being able to use a lot of our own beef. 
K. I just took the plunge and signed up! I pray this works!!!
Just made the Santa Fe Soup! It was SOO good!!! It was a meal for two, and it fed 4 adults with large portions and had a LOT leftover!! Super easy recipe and would be great for camping too!
Here is another exerpt from Jon Acuff's post on our blog yesterday ~ Quantity time creates quality time... Thats why dinner is never really just dinner. Its you sitting down and putting time and attention and hopefully love into the bucket of everyone else at that table. Its you saying, Youre important to me. Life is busy and hectic sometimes, but you matter to me.
I'm new to the e-mealz. If there are any advice or hints that is helpful, I would truly apreciate it. Aslo, if anyone know of any coupon sites that I can print out, that would be just wonderful also. So excited about this new site! :)
Signed up for the 3 month Wal-Mart Regular for 2 meal plan. Question about prices. Prices on the meal plan don't seem to match up with my super wal-mart. Some are a dollar more. Are prices not shown by locality?
I just made the Ranch Chicken Tenders from the Weight Watcher new points menu...I give it 2 thumbs up....I was so excited that my 3 year old tried it and liked it. She is a picky eater and usually does not eat the meat I put on her plate...not tonight though!!!
just did the Italian Chicken Breasts - my whole family loved it! My first meal from E-Mealz was a hit! Thank you!!!
We had the simple lasgne tonight and it was just fantastic. Been on this for 1 month now and have yet to find any recipe that wasn't delicious. This has been a lifesaver for our mealtime plans. I tell everyone I know about it.
Loaded Turkey Nachos were awesome!
just got some beef stew packs any crock pot easy ideas?
I was going to subscribe, but just noticed that the website isn't "secure". Anyone have difficulty with this?
I'm into my second week and actually enjoy making dinner again! I really love how the lists tie into your favorite grocery store's sales - although some of the items aren't at the listed price at my store here in VA. Any plans to add Martins or Food Lion?
I LOVED the Aussie chicken from last week! It's been my favorite so far!! 
I am new to e-mealz and have a question...typically I stock up on meats when they go on sale and freeze them so for instance, I always have chicken breasts and lean hamburger in my freezer...since I am on the new points plan for 2, any store plan - my weekly menu's aren't based on sales...so are there certain cuts of meats that are regularly used in the menu's that I can stock up on when they go on sale?
To all the emealz users - how do you get by feeding your families on so little veges? Is it an Australian thing to have at least 3 veges, or a full salad (ie- lettuce, tomato, cucumber, carrot, celery etc) with a main meal? I'm struggling a bit, as our aim over here is to incorporate 2 serves of fruits, and 5 serves of veges per day in our diets. I guess it adds a bit more to the cost, but it cuts down on the prepackaged stuff. Is there a plan that can provide for this style of eating? Also, there's tons of things that just aren't available here, (like i have no idea what smoked turkey sausage is, but i'm not all that keen to find out!). Is there a plan that uses simple, readily available cuts of meat, without the processing? Or is there any chance of getting an Aussie menu happening, as i know of heaps of Aussie mums that would just LOVE this, if it were able to fit more with our lifestyle, and way of eating. 
Just signed up yesterday. Opted for the ALDI plan b/c we have an ALDI's and I've not shopped there. Those of you who have done this for a long time.. do you mind sharing your favorite options? Thx **so excited** Hoping my picky hubby will begin trying out some new things
the frosting on the red velvet cupcakes you posted the recipe for was INSANELY delicious!!! thanks!
I missed you e-mealz and I'm so glad to have you back! My family and I decided to totally change our diet and the regular Kroger plan just didn't fit anymore. So I went it alone for 3 months and did ok, but decided to opt for the vegetarian plan and add some chicken and fish when I feel like it. Thanks for having such a wide variety of plans!
Ok ya'll I need help trying to figure out what program to choose! I have looked at the New point system and also the low carb. I do not see carbs listed in the lowcarb menus. I have thyroid cancer and have had my thyroid removed so I can no longer metabolize carbohydrates, so I have to be very careful. Of the two which plan more veggie less fat and also lower in carbs? TIA
I am making the ribs and baked beans from ALDI 364, is it really supposed to cook on HIGH for 6 hours? It's only been in 3 hours and already is starting to smell like the sauce is scorching. I actually used chops in this meal and they seamed to be largely cooked after being broiled for 10 min on each side.
trying to make the shrimp scampi but it calls for 3 T c of cooking wine...not sure what that means? any help?
So quick question, I'm making the Chicken Parmesan and the sheet doesn't say how long it needs to cook in the over. Help?
Made the Glazed Chicken Thighs from the Publix plan tonight. It was oh so yummy!!!
Love my e-mealz! Made Tilapia Tacos and yummy! So happy I subscribed!!!
Just made the Mexican Potato Bake from the Points Plus plan. I decided to add some fajita grilled chicken to add protein. It turned out so yummy!
Wow You guys are amazingly good w/ customer service. I wasn't happy w/ our local ALDI store.. and had just signed up yesterday. Customer service emailed me DIRECTLY back and reset my plan IMMEDIATELY. Wow.. #Kudo's
Here's my version of the Red Velvet Cupcakes. I cheated a bit and used store-bought frosting since I was also making cake pops at the same time. They look yummy and I can't wait to taste them!!
Meet Cindy, our Point Plan writer. "I want my menus to be family friendly, so the kids dont freak out even though mom and dad may be trying to eat healthier. I view the plan as a jigsaw puzzle trying to piece together things people will like, paired with sales, and giving enough variety to keep the menus interesting." 
Jon Acuff is bringing dinner back! His new post on our blog about how he has unplugged http://ow.ly/3QzKd @jonacuff @ramseyshow #SCL

Hi everyone! I just joined E-mealz and am so excited to try out all the delicious recipes. I did my first shopping this past weekend and the grocery list made everything SO easy. Here is a photo of tonite's yummy dinner Ham & Monterey Frittata w/ Tangy Apple & Orange salad. It was delish and I have lots for lunch tomorrow <3
Meal #4 was Curry Chicken and Apricot Wraps. At first I was apprehensive about the apricot but it's really tasty! Again, the recipe for 2 made plenty for leftovers ~ hurray!

Cabbage and Green Peas Stir fry
Beaten rice is made from brown rice and very light and nutritious as weekend breakfast or to go on lunch box if you have time to make on week days
YAM Curry and Steamed Rice. Yam curry recipe is same as sweet and sour yam just I had added more water to make it a liquid gravy consistency and sprinkle chopped cilantro on last boil.I had cooked India Ferm Basmati Rice, accoding to the insruction on the packet. I had liked the rice, it is very light but little expesive than others.
The Yellow yam which I had used in both Curry and sweet and sour recipe is not Swee Potato. It's wild Yam.
Sweet potato is a excellent source of antioxidant,strongly anti-inflammatory and rich in Vitamins and Minerals and complex carbohydrate with full of fiber and low GI value. It has 90% Vitamin A, 65% Vitamin C, and minerals such as Iron,Calcium, Copper, Manganese,potassium and so on; 80 nutrients all total.
On Last Tuesday was our religious day, so my dinner was without garlic and onion. We don't eat garlic and onion on any religious occasion. Ihad made Paneer mushroom masala Which is Indian cottage cheese( paneer) and mushroom (in gravy) and roti, which Indian homemade bread. The dish was unbelievly delicious. I am going to share tomorrow.
Ever recipe I do try, first if I like the taste than I share. My recipes are unique because they are mix and match of experiment.

Today I'd went to legal seafood in Framingham Ma. and I must say I'd was very disappointed the service was bad the food was over cooked,I'd didn't enjoy my self at all,I don't know when I'll ever go back there again. legal was number one with me
Who loves hake? For those who aren't familiar, it's a lean white fish similar in texture and taste to cod, but with a softer flesh and less flake then cod or haddock. Hake is mild tasting - even a bit sweet with a delicate flavor. It's on all our feature menus this week - come and get it!
Bless you, bless you, bless you for your new food allergy procedures. You have no idea what a kindness this is - makes me want to cry it's so considerate! DH & I will have to take a trip downstate this summer. I can't wait to eat there - I'm a real seafood nut.
Sitting in front of Legal Seafood at King of Prussia. Were told we would be seated at 6:10. It is well beyond that now. Will let you know if we ever get a table. What is your definition of a few minutes?
A little flood from a pipe burst in the building doesn't keep us floundering for long. Woo-hoo!...LTK in the Seaport re-opened today, better than ever. Come visit!

I hate you for kissing me and forcing me to figure out what it all means, Pacey! And I hate you, Dawson, for forcing me to make a choice between our friendship and what I might have had with him. And I hate myself, I mean, I wish we could go back to the way it was, I wish I could take it all back, but I can't. Nothing is worth going through all No one person is worth this. - Joey "Show Me Love"
Well I just thought your next endeavor should be bigger and better than your last one. It's important that you keep on growing both as a person and as an artist. Now I also got you this and I know it's not going to cover the whole thing, but as the saying goes, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. - Pacey "To Green, With Love"
The Oscars are this Sunday. Which movie would Dawson Leery have voted for as Best Director? (Black Swan, The Fighter, The Kings Speech, The Social Network, True Grit) And why?
Because I also want for you to be happy. It's really important for me that you be happy. So I want you to be with someone, whether it be Dawson or New York guy or some man that you haven't even met yet. But I want you to be with someone who can be a part of the life that you want for yourself. I want you to be with someone who makes you feel like I feel when I'm with you. - Pacey "...Must Come to an End"
I believe that all the mysteries of the universe, all the answers to life's questions, can be found in a Spielberg film. See, it's a theory I've been working on. You see, whenever I have a problem, all I have to do is look to the right Spielberg movie and the answer's revealed. - Dawson "Pilot"
We found what we needed, which, as I'm sure you know, is sometimes just as important. In a spiritual sense. 'Cause, you know, if you found everything that you needed today, what would be the point of waking up tomorrow and doing it all over again? It just wouldn't seem worth it. - Pacey "Castaways"
You know, it's amazing, personality like yours and you still can't get any dates. - Pacey "Double Date"

This dish from Stockpiling Moms looks delicious and kid friendly!
Cute idea for Valentine's Day from Pillsbury, heart shaped cinnamon rolls. 
My husband and I are debating a garden this year. What should we grow?! We need easy stuff for beginners!!
We are gearing up for another round of snow here, which means more eating?! I read an article that experts recommend eating soup, salmon, and water because it will trick your body into thinking it's July. Interesting combination...What do you think?
Snow is still on the ground here, a lot of it actually with more on the way. So, for dinner tonight I'm making Hawaiian Fish. I'm going to eat dinner and dream about sunshine and sandy beaches! Then...it's on to Super Bowl snacks!!
If you are in need of a good soup recipe, this is my favorite so far! Enjoy this delicious soup.
Check our where I found my Chicken Tortilla Soup this morning? On The Pioneer Woman - Ree Drummond Tasty Kitchen blog among some incredible recipes!! Check them out!!
In a few hours I'm going turn my kitchen into a Romantic Italian Restaurant setting, so we can go 'out' on our date tonight! =) We are serving an Italian Soup tonight with lots of desserts...of course! What's for dinner at your house?
If you are in the Tulsa area be sure to go enter to win circus tickets for Friday at 2:30 show! I've been almost every year of my life, it's a great family event!! I'm expecting lower entries due to the time and date of this show, so good chances of winning! 4 chances to win! Have fun!
We are having mini meatloaf tonight! Used mini meatloaf pans and cupcake tins! Is it okay to call my meatloaf, cute?! 
I'm not sure anymore if I live in Oklahoma or Michigan?!? We now have 6 more inches of snow falling and I took my car to work today. That was a bad idea!! I think I need to go bake some cookies just to get some sanity back!! =)
We are now up to somewhere between 8-9 inches of snow in my area, soup will definitely be on the menu today!
In light of a blizzard we are having Chicken Noodle Soup today with homemade rosemary bread. So thankful the electricity is on!! What are you having today?! Is it snowing in your area?
Use your stockpiles and your neighbors if you have too! =)
Check out this post on Freezer Cooking from Life as MOM, she has great tips for all those beginning freezer cooking!!
Anyone have good ideas of a bread to pair with an Italian style soup?
Lesson Learned: When following one of your own recipes, it would be a very good idea to actually follow it or your cookies may turn into pancakes! Whoops...that's my Mommy Hates Cooking moment of the day! =)
I just read that it is a scientific fact that when you are cold you eat more. I am so glad to know that it's normal that I feel like I have eaten enough to last me a month in 1 week while being snowed in!
Just got my March All You magazine today! Love the recipes in there and the coupons! Did you get one? They always have good, easy recipes!
I am planning to use Swagbucks to buy the ice cream attachment for my mixer. Have you signed up for Swagbucks yet? Sign up, earn points, then shop for free! =)
Here is a healthy kitchen tip that I use regularly, most times applesauce can be substituted for oil in muffins and cakes. I also use it in cookies. This helps reduce the unnecessary fats that come from oil. Do you like to use applesauce in your baked items?
Going to brave all the snow and attempt to get to work today!! We'll see how far I get, maybe I should pack the sled in the back just in case!!
When I first started cooking, I could not believe how many different types of flour there were or what they were for!! I learned the differences quickly; however, this is a great article by Food Basics 101 that teaches all about the different types of flour and purposes, be sure and check it out!
Here is a post from Stockpiling Moms about changing your FB feed to be sure you get all your updates. Make sure you are doing this as FB just made changes that will alter who you see updates from on your home page!!
Has anyone else made homemade bagels before? I tried once...and then again...failed. So what's a girl to do? Panera....that's the 1st stop I'll be making today. Someday soon, I'm going to conquer these homemade bagels!
I heard on the radio a few weeks ago that you can place frozen meat into a skillet and sit it on the stove and within 1-2 hours it will completely defrost. The DJ said that she had done this and it worked for her. I don't know if I believe it, think I'll have to try and see, what do you think?
Has anyone made good snow ice cream yet? I think I may try it this afternoon!! What better way to enjoy the snow!
I'm craving breakfast for dinner for some reason! So, I may try this recipe and turn it into waffles tonight. 
One of these sounds delicious tonight...minus the coffee, I might like to sleep! =)

just made... or i'm sorry tried to make, your apple bread. smelled wonderful but i messed it up somehow. i am not a good substituter, and i didnt have apple butter so i used regular buter which may have been the problem i dont know. the sides cooked and the middle never did. so the outside is burnt a little, the inner edges are eadible, and the inside is just barely thicker than applesauce. i will get apple butter and try again b/c i REALLY wanna eat this it smells wonderful! i also used whole wheat flour. trying to get some healthy snacks for my 10 month old. thanks for the recipe!

Chocolate Strawberry Heart-Shaped Ice-Cream Sandwiches Ingredients Makes 24 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup cocoa powder 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 large eggs 1 tablespoon milk 2 to 2 1/2 pints strawberry ice cream, slightly softened Directions In a medium bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter, vanilla, and sugar. Add eggs and milk, and mix until combined. Add reserved flour mixture, and mix on low speed until incorporated, scraping the sides of the bowl with a spatula at least once. Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a flat disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap, and chill until firm, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface; use an offset spatula to unstick the dough every few turns of the rolling pin. Roll dough to an 1/8-inch thickness. Cut dough using a variety of heart-shaped cookie cutters from 2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter, making sure there is a top and bottom cookie for each sandwich. Place hearts on a parchment-lined baking sheet; chill until firm, about 30 minutes. Remove from refrigerator; use a fork to prick holes all over the surface of the cookies. Bake until firm, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly on baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Using half the cookies, spoon softened strawberry ice cream about 1/2 inch thick on each underside. Place matching cookie on top of ice cream, top-side facing out. Transfer immediately to freezer to harden; repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve directly from the freezer. Sandwiches can be stored in an airtight container in the freezer for 3 to 4 days.

Sweetheart Salad Dress up a green salad for Valentine's Day with a garnish of tender beet hearts. Prepare the beets by roasting or steaming them: To roast, heat oven to 400 degrees, wrap beets tightly in foil, and cook until a fork slides in easily, about 1 hour; to steam, place whole beets in a steamer basket in a medium saucepan, and cook until fork tender, 25 to 60 minutes, depending on their size. Peel the beets once they're cooled; for easy peeling, use paper towels to rub skins off. Slice peeled beets thinly with a mandoline, and make heart shapes with a cookie cutter. Serve arranged around the edge of your favorite green salad.
Meringue Heart Ice-Cream Sandwiches Piping meringue into hearts will be easier if you draw the shapes onto parchment paper first. We made some hearts roughly 2 3/4 inches across and others 3 1/4 inches. Ingredients Makes 8 4 large egg whites 1 cup sugar Pinch of cream of tartar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 pint ice cream Directions Preheat oven to 175 degrees. Put egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar in a heatproof mixer bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Whisk constantly until egg whites are warm to the touch and sugar is dissolved (test by rubbing the mixture between your fingers), about 3 minutes. Transfer bowl to mixer; beat on low speed, gradually raising to high, until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 10 minutes. Mix in vanilla. On parchment-lined baking sheets, pipe meringue into hearts; bake until firm but not brown, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Let cool on sheets, about 20 minutes. Let ice cream soften about 5 minutes. Put 1/4 cup ice cream on the flat side of half the meringue hearts. Top with remaining hearts, and freeze sandwiches until ice cream is set, about 15 minutes.
Chocolate Charms Ingredients Makes 40 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for dusting 1/4 teaspoon table salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature 3/4 cup sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (optional) Directions Sift together flour, cocoa, and salt into a bowl. Place butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add sugar, and beat about 2 minutes more, until very light in color and fluffy, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Add vanilla, if using. Add flour mixture, and combine on low speed, scraping with spatula if necessary, until flour is just incorporated and dough sticks together when squeezed with fingers. Form dough into a flattened disk; wrap in plastic. Chill until firm, at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a spoon, form dough into 1-inch balls; place on prepared baking sheet. Bake until firm, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating halfway through. Cool completely on wire rack. Dust with cocoa powder just before serving. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.
Heart Pancakes The perfect breakfast treat for your loved ones. Ingredients Makes twelve 4-inch pancakes 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1 cup milk 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly, plus 1 tablespoon for griddle Directions Preheat griddle to 375 degrees, or heat griddle pan over medium-high heat. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl. Add egg, milk, and 2 tablespoons melted butter; whisk to combine. Batter should have small to medium lumps. Preheat oven to 175 degrees. Test griddle by sprinkling with a few drops of water. If water bounces and spatters, it is hot enough. With paper towel, brush 1/2 teaspoon butter onto griddle. Wipe off excess. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch plain round tip with batter; twist end of bag, and secure with rubber band. Working in batches, pipe heart shapes, drawing V of batter in center of hearts to fill, on heated griddle. When pancakes have bubbles on top and are slightly dry around the edges, about 2 minutes, flip over. Cook until golden on the bottom, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining batter, using 1/2 teaspoon butter on griddle for each batch, keeping finished pancakes on a heat-proof plate in the oven until ready to serve.
Beet Ravioli Stuffed with Ricotta, Goat Cheese, and Mint Ingredients Serves 4 as a main course or 8 as an appetizer 3/4 cup fresh ricotta cheese (about 6 ounces), drained 30 minutes 3/4 cup fresh goat cheese (about 5 ounces), room temperature 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint, plus small sprigs for garnish Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 recipe Fresh Beet Pasta Dough Semolina flour or fine cornmeal, for dusting 2 tablespoons coarse salt Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 6 tablespoons unsalted butter Directions Make the filling: Stir together cheeses and herbs; season with salt and pepper. Make the ravioli: Dust a baking sheet with semolina or cornmeal. Work with each sheet of dough just after it's been rolled. Cut sheet in half crosswise, and trim each half to a 3-inch-wide strip. Space tablespoons of filling 3 1/2 inches apart along center of 1 strip. Top with remaining strip, and gently press around filling to seal, working from center out. Using a fluted pastry cutter, cut into 3-inch squares. Transfer ravioli to sheet, and cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat with remaining pasta dough and filling. (To store, lightly dust ravioli with semolina, and refrigerate between layers of parchment in an airtight container for up to 4 hours. Alternatively, freeze ravioli in a single layer on a baking sheet, about 15 minutes, and then pack as described above; freeze for up to 1 month. Do not thaw before cooking.) Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add salt and half of the ravioli. Cook, stirring occasionally to separate, until edges are just tender, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a colander to drain. Drizzle with oil, and toss gently to coat. Transfer to a bowl, and loosely cover to keep warm. Repeat with remaining ravioli. Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until butter is dark golden brown and has a nutty aroma, about 4 minutes. Divide ravioli among plates (if first batch has cooled, return them to hot water for 15 seconds, then drain). Spoon brown butter over ravioli. Serve immediately garnished with mint.
Goat-Cheese "Ravioli" with Parsley Sauce Ingredients Serves 2 3 ounces fresh goat cheese 1/4 cup part-skim ricotta cheese 1 small garlic clove, crushed through a garlic press Pinch of ground nutmeg Coarse salt and ground pepper 12 square wonton wrappers (3 1/2 inch) Parsley Sauce Directions In a small bowl, use a fork to mash together goat cheese, ricotta, garlic, and nutmeg until smooth; season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Assemble ravioli: Arrange 6 wrappers on a work surface, keeping remaining wrappers covered with a damp papper towel. Spoon 1 level tablespoon filling in the center of each wrapper. With a fingertip, wet edges of wrappers with water. Fold a corner of each wrapper over filling to form a triangle, and press edges to seal. Flatten area around filling to eliminate air pockets. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. Place on a baking sheet with parchment paper. (If making ahead, cover ravioli with plastic wrap; refrigerate up to 1 day. Or freeze on sheet for 1 hour, then transfer ravioli to a large resealable freezer bag; freeze up to 1 month.) Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; reduce to a bare simmer. Drop ravioli into water, one at a time, stirring them gently to prevent sticking. Cook until al dente, 5 to 7 minutes. (Cooking time is the same for frozen ravioli.) Using a slotted spoon, transfer ravioli to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet, and arrange in a single layer to drain briefly. Divide between two plates; drizzle with parsley sauce, and serve immediately.

Chocolate Candy Hearts What you'll need: * Plastic heart-shaped candy mold * Red, white and cocoa colored candy melts * Sandwich bags (zipper, not pleated) * Scissors * Spoon * Wax paper * Plate * Wooden skewer or clean craft paint brush How to make it: 1. Put a handful of candy melts into an open zipper sandwich bag. 2. Microwave candy in bag for 30-40 seconds or until melted. 3. Cut one corner of the bag with scissors to squeeze melted candy through. Caution: Bag may be hot, so use paper towel or a pot holder to handle it. 4. Gently squeeze chocolate out of bag and into the molds. 5. Tap the side of the mold tray to knock out any air bubbles and flatten chocolate. 6. Place in refrigerator until set. 7. Pop out of molds and serve. Decorating Polka dots - Use the flat end of a wooden skewer or a clean craft paint brush to dip into melted chocolate. Dot onto molds, then refrigerate. Remove mold from refrigerator when solid, then add contrasting color according to directions above. Drizzles - Use a spoon to drizzle melted chocolate across the molds by sweeping a spoon back and forth and allowing chocolate to fall in streams. Refrigerate until solid. Add contrasting color according to directions above. 3D Drizzles - Use the spoon method above, however this time drizzle the chocolate over solid candy that you have already made and let set, rather than drizzling into the molds. Tips: * Candy molds can be found at discount department and craft supply stores in the craft section near the cake decorating supplies. They look much like a muffin tin, though much smaller and made from clear plastic. * You can use chocolate chips instead of candy melts and use food coloring to change or tint white chocolate. * Be careful when dealing with melted chocolate as it can be very hot. Always supervise children closely when making anything in the kitchen.
Valentine Strawberry Shortcakes Ingredients * 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour * 2 teaspoons baking powder * 1/4 teaspoon baking soda * 1 tablespoon sugar * 1/2 teaspoon salt * 1/2 cup shortening, chilled * 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut in small pieces * 1 cup buttermilk * 1 quart strawberries cut small * 1/4 cup sugar * 1 cup heavy cream * 2 tablespoons sugar * 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Cooking Instructions 1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly grease 2 cookie sheets. 2. In a large bowl whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt to combine. Cut in the shortening and butter using two knives or a pastry blender until the pieces are about the size of peas. Add buttermilk and stir to blend. 3. Turn out on lightly floured board. Knead about 4 times and pat into a 3/4-inch thick rectangle. Using a 3-inch heart-shaped cutter, cut out biscuits. Cut as many biscuits as possible by reforming scraps into a 3/4-inch thick rectangle. 4. Bake about 20 minutes or until golden and baked through. 5. In a medium bowl, mix strawberries and sugar to combine. Let sit until juice forms. 6. In a large bowl with a beater on medium-high, beat cream with sugar and vanilla until whipped. 7. To serve, slice through biscuit horizontally and place cut sides up on a plate. Top with 1/4 cup berries and juice and 1/3 cup of whipped cream. Make it Faster Instead of using a cookie cutter, pat the dough into a rectangle and cut into serving-sized squares with a sharp knife.

Add the flour and nuts and blend thoroughly. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out with fudgy crumbs. Be careful not to over bake! You want the outside to be a bit crisp and retain a fudge-like interior. Cool in the pan. Refrigerate for 30 minutes for easier cutting. Lift brownies out of pan with foil handles. Invert onto back of pan. Carefully remove foil. Carefully flip over onto a cutting board. Cut into heart shapes with a heart shaped cookie cutter. Place half of the brownies on individual dessert plates. Arrange strawberries over the brownie. Top with whipped cream or whipped topping. Top with another brownie creating a sandwich. Garnish with a strawberry half. Serve immediately. Makes 10 heart shaped brownies (depending on the size of your heart-shaped cookie cutter or about 5 to 6 servings.

Ingredients: 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup sugar 2 eggs 1 cup flour For decoration I used: Whiped cream coconut mixed with red food coloring Marzipan for the hearts and teddy bears Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8 inch cake pan and line with a circle of parchment paper. Beat the margarine and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the margarine mixture before adding the next. Fold in the flour until only small lumps remain; pour into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. With a spatula I covered all the cake, sprinkled it with coconut and then decorated with marzipan hearts and teddy bears.

I saw the Olive Green Vintage Crock-Pot on your picture of Crock-Pots page, I still have mine and use it as a extra when we need more then one Crock-Pots, the lid is missing so I use a dish but it still works fine. In fact my "new" one is from the early 90's, so it is almost vintage also.
Happy Valentines Day! Are you making a romantic dinner for two in your Crock-Pot slow cooker? If so, comment below with what you are making.

I love my crock pot!! Just bought one for a house warming gift! So glad I found this page~
LOVE my Crock Pot from Rival! Always have one large and one mini in the house! My family's fave recipe is an oldie, but a goodie that a friend gave me many years ago. Easy Beef Stroganoff: 1# of stew meat, one can cream of mushroom soup, and 1/2 the soupcan of good quality red wine. I usually double the recipe or sometimes I just double the sauce ingredients. Cook on high for 4-6 hours or low for 8. The wine makes the meat a little reddish even tho it is cooked. I serve over noodles, but sometimes rice. Have to make it at least once a week in the Autumn and the Winter. My son says its his favorite comfort food!
Just had to share with you that I tried the Chicken Marsala from your slow cooker bible cookbook and it was a hit in my house! My husband loved it and told me to add to my list of recipes to do again! 
Made the potato and mushroom chowder from your recipe yesterday. It was FABULOUS!!!! Thankyou!!
I own 4 Crock~Pots, including my first one bought in 1978 which is now considered the Dipper size ~~ one porkchop and a small can of sauerkraut was my favorite meal back then. I use one of them every week to make something for work lunch, even throughout the summer to avoid heating up the kitchen. My most used appliance.
Whats on your menu for the Big Game today? Weve been posting recipes all week, but would love to hear what your favorite recipes are for game-day.
What is your favorite Valentines Day treat? Chocolate-Covered Strawberries are always a treat. Check out this slow cooker recipe for chocolate fondue.

putting together Ratouille soup for tomorrow,one of our favorites!
I have several crock pots because I feed many teens at our tailgates and parking lot cookouts. I always have baked beans, nacho cheese, and usually warm cobbler, plus I have to have one for keeping the burgers and hot dogs warm. YUM!
After not using a Crock-Pot for several years, I just started three weeks ago, and I am now hooked again. 
I did a Thai Chicken Pumpkin Soup from a Crock-Pot recipe book in the slow cooker last night, and it was fabulous! Looking forward to the leftovers tonight!
We were pleasantly surprised (and impressed) that many of you use your slow cookers all year round. Are your summer time recipes different from your winter recipes? If so, share those with us!
Does anyone kno how to fix Spaghetti in the crock pot?

Hey fans - Did you see the Crock-Pot slow cookers on Top Chef All-Stars last night? If you had to make a meal for 100 people in just a couple hours using your slow cooker, what would you make?
Can anyone possibly share with me 2 recipes to feed 50 people? We are doing a pre-wedding bbq/party and I want to make chile & anything else that may be easy to serve. I have 4 crock pots ready to go :) Thanks so much,
I have a beef roast in my crock right now and my house smells delicious!
Love my Crock Pot, throw everything in and Voila!!!!
I left my Slow Cooker today cooking our Sunday Dinner. I put a small chuck roast with potatoes, onions, salt, pepper and garlic. I put a package of Eckridge smoke skinless sausage on top of the roast. As it cooks all day the favor of the sausage seep in to the roast and the taste is so good, it's different and yummy. The last 30minutes I will add a can of baby carrots. Can't wait to get home.
made chili in the crock pot: 2 can fire roasted tomatoes undrained, 2 cans pintos-one drained and one not, 1 whole polska keilbasa, 3 tbsp chili powder and salt and pepper to taste. cook on low for 3 to 4 hrs or until heated thru. we ate this for several days, it was so good!!! 
ive made a korean dish of dakjuk (chicken N rice porridge) in my slow-cooker put it on when i got up and is now done and ready to enjoy after church, yum. I<3 my slow-cooker!
Next month I will be caring for my daughter who is having heart surgery and her two young sons, I need more crock pot ideas. Would like something for chicken, and a pasta dish not using spaghetti sauce. 
 Pork Loin with onions and field peas This dish is comfort food and so easy to make. It is worth the extra steps in the skillet. Delicious served over rice with cabbage or collards. 1 (1 pound) pork loin 1 (16 oz.) package frozen field peas 1 tsp. dry mustard 1 tsp. salt 1 tsp. pepper tsp. garlic powder cup all-purpose flour 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil 1 large sweet onion, sliced 1 (10.5 oz.) can chicken broth Place liner in crock pot or spray with cooking spray. Place peas in bottom of cooker. Combine spices and sprinkle over the pork loin. Dredge the loin in flour. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook the loin on each side until just brown. Transfer pork to slow cooker. Reserve drippings in the skillet and add the onion. Cook onion for 6-7 minutes until tender. Add the chicken broth and scrap the bottom of the pan to get the loose particles. Cook for 2 minutes then spoon over the pork. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours.
 would like some soup recipes to make in the crock-pot
I have the best pork roast and saurkraut recipe for the crock pot. Everyone I've given this recipe to and has tried it just raves about it. :o)
Can you make rice in the crock pot?
Is it best to cook the ground beef first and then add to the chili mixture in the crock-pot? 
I have 2 Crock Pots. My 17 year old pot works fantastic. My newer larger model has had the handle break twice on the side and I glued it. The lid handle broke and I have glued it twice. Today the handle broke as I was lifting it from the hot roast dish and it fell into the pot and splashed me with hot sauce from the pot. Can I get this thing replaced? I can't believe my old one is perfectly fine and my new one is breaking so much. I need the lid handle to work obviously. I used a steak knife to lift the lid and used a towel to hold the hot glass lid. Maybe mine is just a lemon???
Looking for a twist on traditional beef chili? Try this recipe, which has been perfected by Jon; one of our Crock-Stars. http://bit.ly/hSRha8
I have a recipe that I want to share: Smothered Pork Chops: 1 pk of bone-in thick chops seasoned however you like, a jar of your fav. tomato sauce (or homemade) julienned green peppers & 1 quartered sweet onion. put all in crockpot & enjoy. The meat falls of the bone, the peppers stay crisp & your house will smell like pizza. Try it.
Just heard how a friend, a life long user of the product, was basically told tough luck and get lost when looking for some help with a problem. Nice customer service. I'll be taking my future buisness elsewhere and encourage all to do the same. Who treats loyal customers like that? 
Busy this weekend? Let your slow cooker save you some time. Heres a recipe for Southwest Chicken Casserole. http://bit.ly/g5sqXA

Hey, Crock-Pot: Are you every going to get the Travel Bag back in stock? I have a couple of (Crock-)potlucks coming up! 
Dear Crock Pot FB Page...I have an older crock pot made in America that I dearly love...but my NEW crockpot cracked after being used twice....surprisingly it was MADE IN CHINA. I will not buy anymore...hopefully I can find some of your older products at garage or estate sales.
My FAVORITE Crock Pot food is Steel Cut Oatmeal. I use 2/3 soy 1/3 water and 5 sticks of cinnamon 4 hours on high (6 on low) and I have a healthy hot breakfast ready for me in the morning!

One way to declutter a cluttered bathroom is to store excess stuff in another location such as a closet or back room. If you have 10 towels but only use three or if you buy toilet paper in bulk, think about moving these things to another room until they are needed. How do you keep your bathroom clutter free?
Recycling is easy if you organize an assigned recycling area! Set up recycling containers larger than you actually need, this way if your recycling efforts arent timely you wont be stuck with piles of clutter! Like this status if you recycle!
I like your site! Interesting.... I use to work in a bakery... Just a note, better cream icing is not a buttercream icing....it is called better because it is better for those people who cannot or choose not to eat buttercream... it is marshmellowish... I don't like it either but it it just another alternative for those not interested in buttercream... Variety is the spice of life... especially in cooking.

I'm 19, spending a semester studying abroad in Italy, and love to bake. I came across your blog and have spent parts of the last two days reading every single post! 1. You're hilarious. 2. I plan on trying lots of your recipes when I get home this summer. 3. I HAVE tried a few of them already! Martha's yellow cake. . . not so good for me, either. . . and the Chocolate Gobs? They're in my Southern Living: Best Loved Cookies book. It's a GREAT book. 4. Since I'm in Europe, I've consumed more than my fair share of Nutella. It would be a great cupcake filler. . . or mixed with frosting. . . or Nutella cookies?? I can't experiment with those things yet. I'm too busy here, and I can't seem to find measuring cups anyway, since everything's in grams. But if you're wanting any new ideas, I'd love to hear how something Nutella-y comes out!

I used to get my humanely-raised meat burritos from Chipotle, but since moving out of a Chiptole-filled city, I've found EVOL to fulfill my burrito needs :D
Hey evol. Just tried your egg and green chili burrito and I'm in love. Keep the great scratch-made eats coming...
Where can I get evol burritos on the coast? Area code 97450. Tks.!
Goodness gracious! Just had my first, my life is changed. We live in Door County WI with very very few restaurants. These are a life line!!!! :) Thank goodness Pic N Save stocks them. Keep veggie options coming !!! 
This year's festEVOL will be featuring awesome music, innovative natural brands, a sustainably-focused 'ECO village' & on-mountain adventure during prime time spring-skiing conditions! http://dlvr.it/HQF5m
thanks for the teeshirt! just got it and the stickers! you guys are a great company!
A FB winner scores some EVOL swag for her killer haiku. Thx, Megan! Borborygmi here Evol bowls to the rescue Rumbles are no more.
Your vegan burritos are a LIFESAVER. I'm not a huge fan of flour tortillas, so when I read "insanely tasty" on the wrapper, I thought "yeah right!" But they ARE. They're the best tortillas I've ever had! I'm happy to have two vegan options, but I want MORE! 
just tried your spinach tofu burrito and OMG its awesome! Can we find you in Costco soon??

So, we went to Costco today to get goodies for Super Bowl. I couldn't believe how many sample stations there were, not to mention how crowded it was. Now, I don't know about any other Costco member but I always try the samples and 7 times out 10 I end up buying the item. Today, some extremely RUDE customer approached my teenage daughter and said 'I see you, your mom and brother getting all the samples but you dont have anything in your cart' My daughter said 'We have stuff in our cart' and the lady said oh ok and walked off. That really TICKED me off! I left there spending over $150 in just food for Super Bowl and I know I spend over $700 a month there.. how dare she say anything to my daughter! Is there a problem with trying the samples?
New Harmonics' Vineyard Cherry is on coupon and AMAZING!
$3 off a pepperoni pizza! THANKS!
Any plans on offering Halal food sometime soon, like burgers and hot dogs? My Super Bowl party just doesn't cut it with just chips and salsa.
when I went to my local Costco I saw they no longer carried the 60 count "Eggo Homestyle" waffles, only the blueberry...has anyone tried the Kirkland brand of waffles and if so, how are they compared to "Eggo"?
RACIST & STINGY COMPANY. WHY BOTHER TO OPEN BOOTH IN OTHER ETHNIC GROUP CELEBRATION, IF ONLY TO BE RUDE & KEEP THE SAMPLES TO THEMSELVES? REALLY, BRING SACKS OF POPCORN, BUT HAUL THEM BACK, MAYBE FOR THEIR OWN FAMILY.
They need to add Photos ,..so we can share some Photos of our great buys.Talk about free advertisement,..nothings better than word of mouth.A true fan/shopper...
There is no doubt Costco is great for staples like milk and eggs, but I think the best thing about them (foodwise) is that they have fun foods like Nutella, olives and quinoa at great prices. I post on my blog fairly frequently about foods like these.
What? No Picture Posting? I want to show my hair growth from using the Kirkland Signature Minoxidil Extra Strength for Men. just about 5 week and I see improvement. Maybe I'll change my profile pic?
If it wasn't for your pre-cooked packages of bacon, my fiance would never get a chance to enjoy it! :-) 
CostCo, I love everything about you except 1 thing...can you please bring back the Tyson chicken wings? I had to start buying them from Wal-Mart or HEB. I don't like the ones from Foster Farms. Thanks for the consideration.
Totally LOVE Costco and all of their products! Recently I did go there on Saturday when their answering service said they closed at 6pm and found out that they don't close until 7pm. It was 7:03 and they wouldn't let me in to grab some flowers really quick which I totally understand. But was totally disappointed when I politely suggested that she suggest that they change their message. She wouldn't even acknowledge me and turned her back to me. Thumbs down on that one Costco...:(
LOVE LOVE LOVE the Costco freshly made pizzas!! Better than any take out! I do, wish, however, that you would bring back the strawberry filling for the cakes!!! That was hands down the BEST filling. We don't buy them anymore because we don't like the chocolate or cream cheese. Please bring it back!!!!!
I get all of my professional photographs printed at Costco. The two machines they run, with managed color profiles are fabulous quality with silly great prices.
Stretch Island Fruit Leather...please come back!!!
Can anyone tell me how much the new Kirkland moisture shampoo & conditioner are? It's not listed on the website. I just received my free sample and loved it!
If you go to Costco in Quebec... You NEED to try WAFU Japanese dressing! So, so good and addictive!!!! Unfortunately they don't have all the flavours - but they have Wafu Original (sesame). Some Costcos in Ontario sell it, too.
If you havent tried vita muffins pls. do. Avaliable at select costcos in the freezer section. If you love them like I do Tell Costco to keep them for good. Currently a temporary item.
I bought bagels that had a sell by date of 1/31 and now they are moldy. It seems way too short for me....I stored them in a relatively dry environment too.
Has anyone ever had a problem with Costco Optical? I purchased frames and lenzes a year ago and the lenzes now have stress fractures in both lenzes. The Costco store I go to refuses to do anything about the problem. Just checking to see if this has happened to anyone else. THX
Mixed berry smoothie& a hot dog! yummy :D only from costco
Went to the Duncanville, Texas Costco on Saturday afternoon following the big ice storm here in the DFW area, it was also the day before the Superbowl. Parking lot was crowded, so was the store. Lines all the way back into the sales floor. Amazingly fast checkouts, so happy the store was fully stocked as opposed to empty shelves I'd heard others complaining about at other area stores. Thank you, Costco!
When is Costco going to move up and start offering foods without High Fructose Corn Syrup?

Why oh why have you stopped selling terra chips at some of your locations???!!! Those are the best chips in the world:( I was so upset when I realized they were gone.
How about bringing a Costco to Oklahoma city????
Wish COSTCO had gallon size Lipton Tea Bags - then I would have no need for Sam's membership anymore.
I met this lady thats a florist, she owns her own shop and guess where she buys a lot of her flowers? Yep, Costco! She said they're fresh, beautiful and better than where her competitors get them wholesale! She said it's her "secret"!
Been loving the organics I've been finding at my Costco lately! Frozen organic peaches and blueberries, organic tortilla chips and guacamole in the 100 cal snack packs! Keep it coming Costco!
Can you please bring back the Emerald Cocoa Roast Dark Chocolate Flavored Almonds to your Temecula/Lake Elsinore stores! They were the BEST! Plus people are totally into dark chocolate now! Please bring back, PLEASE!! Thank you!!
Someone told me that Costco is supposed to open a warehouse in Rigby, Idaho. Is this actually a fact or just a rumor? If one will be opened there, does anyone know when?
Costco loves me and gave me early Valentine gift, dozen huge strawberries dipped in dark chocolate and drizzled with white.....for only $12.99....Yum!!!!!

Is it just me or does anyone else have trouble pouring milk from the Costco milk jugs (square shaped)? When you first open it and until you get rid of some of the milk in the jug, it just spills down the side. I just made a bowel of cereal and lost a bunch of milk all over the counter. Costco...any comments??? 
I have not been able to find Campbell soup in your warehouse. Is it being discontinued by COSTCO?
Just got the email that the roses I had ordered from Costco have been held for inspection by US Customs & that I will be getting a full refund instead of them being delivered tomorrow on Valentine's Day. 
I'm from Hillsboro, Oregon and we have Costco Wholesale #692. The largest Costco bulit to date. Over 250,000 square feet. Gas station and full furniture department. Its a nice store. Opened back in 2005. 
Just bought 9 months worth of Nature Made Prenatal vitamins for only $39, if I bought the same amount anywhere else it would have been $90!! Gotta love Costco. :)

Ask about our Village Select Payment Plan for those with out Insurance. Visit us at villagedentalcarestockton.com
Costco's handling of order #218005411 is completely unacceptable. Thanks for dropping the ball. Next time you promote something as often as you did with product #563106, make sure you can actually fulfill it by the date you promised. #fail
costo's pizza's the best!!!!!!
Ok, I LOVE Costco but beware to anyone at Costco for buying Norton Internet Secuirty with Utilities to protect their computer. I couldn't activate the product code for Utilities so I stupidly called Norton. Hold time:1 hr 20 min the first call and my phone dropped the call. No one bothered to call me back. Second call 2 hr hold, yes 2 hrs and 3 people later and Norton says you don't need to activate code since you had Norton Internet Security last year and just activated 2011 this year. Now I have a stupid rep calling and calling me from Norton. For what? Who knows? I can't believe overseas customer service has sung this low. I know I'll be switching my computer security to another company next year. Costco needs to know what kind of horrible company Norton is. Still Love my Costco.
I REALLY FEEL THAT COSTCO SHOULD CONSIDER EXCEPTING (THE GOVERNMENT) EBT (FOOD STAMP CARDS) IT WOULD BOOST THE ECONOMY IN OUR SURROUNDING COMMUNISTS AND BENEFIT COSTCO BY REACHING OUT TO THOSE LESS FORTUNATE.
what is the exact difference between extra virgin olive oil and organic oil? i don't know about you but here is what i think http://www.gren-spot.com/Extra-Virgin-Organic-Olive-oil.html

I will not buy those oranges from China - please stock American-grown foods.
CostCo... you have the most handsome man that I have ever seen working at your St. John's Town Center in Jacksonville, Florida. Thanks for making me melt! And thanks for burning the roof of my mouth off with your delicious pizza tonight!! ;)
What's up the 100 calorie Wholey Guacamole? You had it for like a week and it's dissapeared. That was like the next best thing since sliced bread. I have three co-workers who want some too. Stock up Costco.
Costco, please add organic apples, pears and potatoes to your selection. Here you will see why: http://planetgreen.discovery.com/food-health/foods-unsafe-doctors-eat.html Thank you very much! I'm sure I would not be the only one buying them.
I have a question. Do you have to be a CURRENT Costco member to buy gas there? I still have my Costco card, but cant afford to be a member right now. Just curious. Thanks!
I highly recommend buying a car through the program costco has. I bought my fifth new toyota through costco and it was a breeze. I spent half the time I usually do at the dealer. The dealer was curteous and very helpful. I will only buy cars now through Costco's program.
The store that is a 15 mile drive doesn't even have the laundry soap I usually get and the Kirkland equivalent is not getting things clean!
Please stock the Nature's Domain Salmon and Sweet Potato dog kibble in your New Jersey stores! I am getting really tired of having to drive over 2 hours each way to Lancaster, PA to buy my dog food !!! I have requested it to be stocked in my local Costco several times, but nobody seems to be taking me seriously. 
costco- i am a member for life and will always love you, but you got rid of the beef bakes featuring the korean bulgolgi beef. you've since replaced it with carne asada bakes. this is the first time you have disappointed me! please bring beef bakes back!!!!!!
Where does Costco get their farm raised Steelhead? Delish.
Costco, please consider stocking ketchup without High Fructose Corn Syrup!
Thanks to the janitor at our Costco Bakery. The bakery was closed and he was cleaning when my husband asked him to write "Happy Birthday" on a multilayed round chocolate cake for my birthday. The janitor said he couldn't but gave my husband a little icing in a plastic triangle and instructed him how to use it. Thanks for making my day a little more special.
hey thats where da awesome mango juice comes from!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i love costco. just joined and have just gone once so far and loved it. loved the popcorn samples they had. they said they are there for two weeks every two months. bought the cheese popcorn, the carmel corn and the zebra chocolate popcorn. i liked the cinnamin one and the strawberry one also. next time they are there want to buy the cinnamin and the strawberry.
very Berry Sundae....Yum!!
Pleased and surprised that Costco has started to add more organic and vegan items. Thank you! I'm so lucky to live 10 minutes from both Costco and Costco Business Center in Tacoma and Fife.

Thanks, Costco, for stocking Rudi's Gluten-Free bread in my Washington State store. At two loaves for $6.99, I save almost $2 a loaf compared to the Whole Foods price! 
how come Tuber Magnatum Pico (white Truffle) discovered by a polish count named De Borsch is more is more popular in Italy then anywhere else. Do you know of anywhere else it can be found today other than the prestigious Alba region in Italy? http://www.gren-spot.com/Sardenian-Cheese-and-olive-oil.htm
My son recently has diagonalized with gluten intolerance. I would like to see costco, have more gluten free products.. Some such as the Rudi products, Arthur or Bisquick Gluten Free Products. There are so many gluten intolerant people, why don't they have more in the stores. I have stopped shopping there for food products, i do still buy other things, there. Like the fact they have chex, but i'd like to see the different varities. Almond Breeze milk, yummy.
Just noticed that Costco is the US sells Kosher, Organic, Free Range Chicken and Beef on its website. Any chance that Costco.ca might sell this too. I know that it would be hugely popular here.
We are now selling Kims Magic Pop-Original Flovor Because they are so large and bulky we have a minimum of 12 bags for $47.88 plus $9.99 shipping. Share the cost with family or friends. To order use paypal address: ebaynetauctions@aol.com

Hey Costco!! I never got my free sample of your Shampoo and conditioner... really... how many weeks does it REALLY take??
Are you ever going to get frozen blackberries back in stock in Roseville, CA?

Thank you for your new sustainable seafood policy! 
Thank you Costco from a longtime member for your new policy of selling sustainable seafood.

What's the chances of the CO.getting back peaches in the glass jar by Del Monte. The Kirkland peaches are a second quilaty peach. 
Costco is one of the largest seafood retailers in the U.S. and theyll no longer be selling 12 red list species -- including orange roughy, shark and Atlantic halibut! Theyve also agreed to pursue better aquaculture practices and take a global leadership role in the effort to develop a more sustainable tuna industry. WAY TO GO COSTCO!
SNICKERS Peanut butter SQUARES in my Costco forever = member. Deal?
Thanks Costco for taking a more sustainable seafood policy! 
Thank you Costco for keeping gas prices low. I filled up today for $3.15 per gallon while a local BP was charging $3.49. The money I save on gas each year more than pays for my Executive membership.
Thank you Costco for your new policy of selling sustainable seafood. THANKS!!!! http://planetsave.com/2011/02/25/costco-adopts-sustainable-seafood-policy/
SO HAPPY about your decision to sell only sustainable seafood. So many care so much about this issue...but it's up to the big companies to make the real difference. Hooray Costco!!!
Bring back the unsweetened tea in the cafe! Now there is nothing to drink except high-fructose-corn-syrup-sweetened crap.
The seaweed snacks are too greasy. Can you switch to a better brand?
Costco in Northern California is going to be sellling San Francisco Pretzels in 17 buildings. Yippee !
Who decides what items are seasonal? What makes Cardini's croutons a seasonal item? Do you think people stop eating salads in the winter? I try to load up at the end of summer but they don't have a long storage life.

Does anyone know what Costcos in Regina Sask is like??
KEZI 9 in Eugene put out a post recently asking people where they buy their gas- and several people posted Costco- low prices and friendly employees.
A year or two ago the kirkland signature dish washing soap was the best soap on the market leaving no spots. Now this year they reformulated the stuff and it leaves spots and is terrible. Why did they change a perfectly good thing?

Your fellow Costco members may need a last minute Valentines Day gift idea. If youve got a good one, let them know!
Dear Costco, I am a Virginia Beach Navy Spouse and have lived in the area for over 4 years. I appreciate the awesome deals that you offer but in reality, I only have Sam's Club and BJ's Memberships. Why, you ask? Because you only have a Costco in Norfolk and it's pretty unspectacular. Guess what??!!?? The Kmart on ...Holland Road in Virginia Beach went out of business and would make an excellent location for a Costco with a gas station. I've discussed this with numerous VA Beach Residents and they agree that I am a genius, especially with the Pungo and Sandbridge Crowd. Hoping that you'll listen to me since I'm right, Jamilla
Please start selling popchips in your AZ stores!
Anyone know when Costco in Limerick, PA is opening...supposed to be April or May of this yr., but is still not posted on the stores opening soon page???
While shopping at my local Costco, I realized that they were selling gift certs for Outdoor Adventures. I wrote to Costco's head office and they responded back this morning with the following: "Thank you for taking the time to email us with your valid concern. We have pulled these from all our stores and halted sales" I am sure tha...t Costco recieved other emails, but I am extreamly happy to see that they will no longer be supporting this company. For more information on this company and why Costco decided to do this, please see this link - http://www.facebook.com/pages/Boycotting-Outdoor-Adventures-in-BC-Whistler/180065432029885 
Thank you for pulling the gift cert. Yeah, Costco!!!!!!
Costco, you have gained a new consumer. I rarely shop at your stores, but because you chose to pull Outdoor Adventures' gift certificates, I will make more of an effort in the future to choose you over your competitors. I may be one minor person, but if you've affected me this way, I imagine there are others who see your good deed. It did not go unnoticed. Thank you.... on behalf of myself & my 2 sled dogs.
 Take the PLEDGE TO NOT TEXT AND DRIVE! WOULDNT IT BE GREAT IF ALL COSTCO MEMEBERS AND EMPLOYEES DID IT THINK ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE THAT WOULD REACH! http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rememberalexbrownfoundation.org%2F&h=2d8ff
Thank you Costco for pulling Outdoor Adventures gift certificates from your shelves! I echo the sentiments of the post before mine.
Has any one used the Costco Auto program and got better deals while buying a car compared to hassling around with the dealer? any inputs/suggestions is appreciated. 
Love Costco so much and all the great deals....I'm too embarrassed to bring a half-eaten cake back to the warehouse, so I felt I needed to pass the word to someone...the new Red Velvet cake in the bakery is not tasty at all, my family was so looking forward to cutting into it for a recent Birthday celebration~ it was a disappointment. 
Costco has FANTASTIC deals and great products/brands... I loved the recent addition of Timberland khaki/cargo pants and the Timberland full zip fleece pullover; I wish they carried more of these types of items for the entire family!!! I hope Costco looks into carrying more Apple products sometime... Thanks for providing us with pricing leverage! Can you make another run at privatizing the liquor sales in Washington state? I will continue to support you, as the state charges too much in taxes and fees on spirits. Thanks!
Does anyone know if Costco is selling air mattress in the warehouse right now? Thanks!
I had the worst experience in your Clybourn Avenue store in Chicago on Sunday. I just renewed my membership after being away for a year and boy have things changed. You used to have such friendly, helpful staff. Sunday everyone was disinterested and rude--the worst being our cashier--she was practically hostile. Both my aunt and myself were treated incredibly rudely by our cashier and the person helping her. I almost didn't believe it. I've never been treated so rudely by a store employee in my life. I'm very, very disappointed. 
why is costco not carrying kirkland brand severe congestion afrin they were last month some people have severe congestion year round due to severe allergies .and they need to find a better system to find when they are getting something back ,or not :(
I have been a member since 1997 and LOVE the artichoke hearts, as well as many other items at Costco. Shopping there is my weekly treat. I can spend hours in the store.
Ok, so Costco is no longer carrying any Apple products. You can no longer buy iTunes gift cards, iPods...etc...they are in a fight with Apple, and we the consumer are losing. What's with that...fight with Apple...Costco isn't big enough to win that one.
Things I would like to see restocked at Costco: Spot Shot Carpet Cleaner Keurig "Coffee People" Donut Shop Blend Coffee True Ottoman "Entertainer" Chairs
We would love to see more vegetarian/vegan items at Costco. Excellent selection of organics now, good job! The addition of vegan/vegetarian items like Tofurkey brand products and Gimme Lean items along with more Morningstar products would make it just about perfect.
If you are near the Orem, UT Costco - come see The Original Scrapbox products in person!
a big THANK YOU to Cathy, who works the door @ the AJAX location.....she found my blackberry in the slush yesterday and was good enough to find my home number in the contact list and call me to return it! It is soo nice to know that there are people out there who still choose to do the right thing....It would have been easier not to bother, but I sure do appreciate it, and will tell anyone who will listen that she really made my day! It was a Christmas gift and I was truly broken-hearted to have lost it! Thanks again Cathy! :)
TGIF Costco! I'll be stopping in about an hour from now for some of your fillet mignon steaks! Grilling tonight with my friends. Mmm.... they taste so good!

Dear primanti's, Your hot sausage primanti sandwich is god... let's go pens. Happy hour!
i know the colossal fish is going to burn 3 layers off my mouth, but i just can't help tearing into it once it's in front of me.
We need a Primanti Bros in Cincy....had a Pitts Burger in Ft. Lauderdale last week...awesome....thought I was back in PA.....
just experienced this place last night for the first time in Ft Lauderdale. Amazing stuff!
Had a sandwich down in Ft Worth last weekend that tried to match Primanti's but obviously failed. There's nothing like the original!
Just had one from the original down in the strip last night/this morning. It's so damn good after a night of drinking it's unbelievble. And some goof was ordering one without frenchfries. Being fully intoxicated my girlfriend & I spoke our minds about that. haha!
Yesterday my wife and I stopped by the Strip District and when we walked in, I saw the "Sandwich Lady" that was on man vs. food, and I fold my wife that she probably got a sandwich made by her, she was happy about that. Then when the little lady walked around with fresh Baklava, she was all for getting a few pieces for herself. We'll be coming back for more in the future. 
We love the original in da Burgh but the Primanti Bros in Ft Lauderdale on A1A is great and it's right on the beach!
Went to Miami to see Steelers and hit up the Primanti's in Ft.Lauderdale.They have 3 in Florida...Need one here in Ct..
Had a FABULOUS pizza on the beach in Fort Lauderdale yesterday. DELICIOUS food, unbeatable friendly service, and a great view. What more could you want??? Glad I live here.
Desperately need a Primanti branch in Norfolk, VA! Steelers Nation is strong here, and the local restaurants are gosh-awful.
Got 3 Primanti Bros in Broward County, FL. Not quite as good as the original, but still pretty good. =)

Wishing you would offer gluten free option for the bread...I *know* it isn't as good as the original, but for gluten free eaters we could still get our Primanti fix!!!!!
Grab a Primanti Brother's sandwich in the South Side, walk a block down the street, and enjoy the deliciousness to the tunes of Pistol Pete & the Big Beat at the Inn Termission Lounge this Friday
I sold Nick Nicholas a Jeep Wrangler several years ago & drove it to his home in Upper St. Clair for delivery ! Nice guy !!
Loved my Roast Beef sandwich...Thanks
I WOULD TAKE THIS OVER A PHILLY CHEESE STAKE ANYDAY YES
Just saw the Man vs. Food show featuring Primanti's! AWESOME!
On our way back from Columbus, we stopped by Primanti Brothers in the Strip District. Here's a shot of my Pittsburger just prior to consumption. Unlike a horror flick with folks being consumed by monsters, my sammich uttered nary a sound as I shoved it down my ravaging gullet. MMMM! Good, yes, good!
My wife made a great Primanti Brothers sandwich CAKE for the big game yesterday. Yummy!
Primanti Bros. sandwich made out of cake
This photo had my Facebook friends begging me to tell them WHAT this is and WHERE they can get it! Sorry, folks, but it's a Pittsburgh original...
Treat your sweetie to breakfast in bed this weekend. Youll be sure to wow them when you serve a delicious cappuccino topped with a foam heart. See how to do it at http://www.cafebeyond.com/v/1553/free-pour-heart-the-art-of-coffee-latte/

We heard you! The K-Cup drawer is back in stock in our warehouse. Order online now or from your local store! http://ow.ly/3MgfP
Dear BB&B: I LOVE your store, and shop there often...but just was advised the reason I am not receiving my usual coupons is that you've gone to a regional rotation in order to save money on marketing. May seem like a good idea but here's the reality: I'm out of coupons...so I'm not shopping! There's just no telling how much revenue you're loosing with this new policy, but I'd bet dollars to donuts the costs saved will fall far short of the revenue lost - my local manager already sees the hit his store is taking. Send out the coupons again generously please! Thanks! 
Has anyone else heard the rumor that theres a big football game this weekend? We have associates and customers in both Green Bay and Pittsburgh so we wont pick favoritesbut YOU can.
Were total pet people. Did you know we carry lots of practical (and some not so practical) items for your pet? Spikes favorite new hangout spot is his MicroDry memory foam pet mat. So cozy and comfy. Where is your pets favorite place? http://ow.ly/3PzW6
Bed Bath & Beyond, You may want to honor the price mistake on the 18 pack of Yankee Candle Votives that were priced at $1.99. I spend thousands of dollars a year at Bed Bath & Beyond, and I can assure you if you don't "MAKE IT RIGHT", I will no longer be spending thousands a year, at your stores. I will boycott Bed Bath & Beyond, and shop at places where they care about their customers.
I also ordered these votives..at the ADVERTISED WEBSITE PRICE of $1.99 for a set of 18 votives . I have my order confirmation e-mails to prove it, called YOUR company and talked to YOUR rep who assured me that this was the correct price, I then e-mailed sending your company copies of my order confirmation e-mails to prove it. If my order is not honored I will not place another order with your company again..and know many others who will not do so either..and word of mouth is all it takes. If you honored the price for some, you have to honor the price for everyone!
I purchased off the website this morning. I am hoping you will choose to honor the price that was listed on the website for the yankee candle pink sands votive candles, they were listed as 1.99 for and 18 pack. The invoice states yankee candle pink sands votives for 1.99 (18 pack) quantity 4. I would expect to get 72 votives. If BBB chooses not to honor the price as listed online and on my invoice it is false advertisment and poor customer service. I hope you will show you value your customers and follow through with what was posted on the website. Thank you for your time
I Also ordered the votives at the advertised price. This is insane. People were able to go into the stores & the stores would honor the online price But now I'm hearing that the online store won't. If my order isn't honored, Me & My Fiance will not be registering for our wedding at your store & I will NEVER set foot in another one of your stores as long as I live. I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars at your store because of the items you carry & how I view you as a reputible brand. I agree with Kelly Mehta "If you honored the price for some, you have to honor the price for everyone!"
I to ordered from that sale and expect my products, i paid for them my invoice says 18 for 1.99 , we better all get the products we ordered otherwise it is false advertising and i feel your company should be turned in, it wasnt our fault it was your companys fault 
Like others that have posted here...I ordered the votives this morning and my invoice states 18 votives for $1.99. I expect Bed Bath & Beyond to honor my order at the prices stated on my invoice.
I ordered the votives also, and you should also be aware that they have been on your site for that price for WEEKS now. It is totally unfair that some people are being told the prices would be honored and the rest have NO answer whatsoever about what will happen. Any other company I have dealt with have honored MISTAKES THEY MADE!! I have been buying from BBB for many many years now, bedding, coffee, candles, furniture, everything! But after this I am very disappointed with how you changed the quantity of votives everyone ordered in their order status pages, even though our order confirmations showed (Set of 18). Others were able to buy them from your stores in person for the $1.99 price!! So why are some being treated fairly and others not? 
What is up with changing my order after I placed it! Honor your prices on your website!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The rep just canceled my orders because she said I wouldn't get them at that price! FIx this please!
THE WEBSITE IS STILL SHOWING THE PRICES OF BAHAMA BREEZE AND PINK SANDS AS 1.99 FOR AN 18 PACK OF VOTIVES. 
I would like to point out that, according to your Mission Statement, The Companys objective is to be a customers first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets in which the Company operates. The Companys strategy is to achieve this objective through excellent customer service. Additionally, a quote from the companys CEO, Steven Temares: Bed Bath & Beyond has been dedicated to being a responsible corporate entity in the markets we serve as we have built our business by offering attractive merchandise at competitive prices, supported by superior customer service. I am hopeful that you consider your own Mission Statement, which clearly prides itself on excellent customer service and quote from your CEO when deciding to honor your mistake, otherwise I dont feel as though the company would be any customers first choice or considered responsible by many consumers. 
I ordered 3 boxes of votives at the $1.99 price. There is no way I, or anyone really, would have ordered 3 single votives and paid nearly $6 shipping for them. Honor the price AND the item description that was showing online at the time I placed my order. Your reps were saying the sale was legitimate because they were not going to be carried once they were sold out. I placed my order in good faith and I expect you to hold up your end of the deal.
and if it was "just a mistake" Why did CS reps confirm that was the price for the 18 pack of bahama breeze, pink sands, & fluffy towels to MULTIPLE people? 
I understand that websites have glitches sometimes but your reps confirmed the price and said it was because you would not be carrying them anymore!
"Bed Bath & Beyond Everyone, We are aware of the pricing error and are working to correct that on our website. Please rest assured we will gladly honor the price for all existing orders placed for the incorrect price. We are sorry for any confusion and inconvenience. Thanks to everyone for bringing this to our attention and rest assured that we value our customers." 
Please honor my email confirmation price of $1.99 for an 18 votive pack. It's is illegal to change the terms of a sale AFTER the fact, not to mention it's also bad business. If my order reeaches me, and it's NOT what I ordered, I will be filing a charge-back with my CC company and I will also be reporting BB&B to the BBB for illegal business practices. Don't lose my business over a computer glitch!
Just talked to a rep and she told me that my orders would not be canceled and some have already shipped ! I was told that they will honor my order and the price they were listed for. They are calling bbb stores to fullfill our orders. If they succeed in doing so I might just send them flowers :) Thank you admin for helping! Will keep everyone posted on how this turns out. 
Ok, you promised those of us who ordered the 18pack of votives for $1.99 that your company would honor the price. One person posted below that one of her orders for 20 sets of 18 votives shows as shipped at a weight of 2lbs? That tells me that your company sent her 20 votives NOT 20 sets of 18. All this after your company promised to come good on your mistake. I sent e-mails to customer service yesterday and forwarded my order confirmations that showed the 3 sets of 18 that i ordered. I better not find out that I paid $18 and get 3 votives in the mail or I won't ever shop BB&B again..I want someone to check my orders..the order #s are BBB1413942854 and BBB273092507. I want your company to send to me what is on my order confirmation for the price that was advertized and also on my order confirmations..which are 2 sets of 18 on one order and 1 set of 18 on the other. Not 2 single votives on 1 and 1 single votive on the other. 
I just got a call from "Korin" she told me that she was calling on behalf of "Tony". And my order was going to be processed. She was even going to speak w/the CS person I talked to this afternoon. She told me that the orders placed yesterday will be honored. It just will take time for them to get the merchandise. Thank you Tony and Korin.
Overheard at the water cooler: A convo about Valentine's Day gifts... one person's opinion was that gifts with cords (think irons, vacuums) do not make good gifts. Some of us, however, would LOVE a Dyson or Kitchenaid mixer. Let's discusswhat do you think?
It is amazing the greed shown on this page by people who knew very well that the price of the votives had to be a mis-print. Still ordered a Hoarders share and have the gall to complain that their orders aren't being met. You complainers ought to be ashamed. 
Thank you so much for the update email you sent out, about the Yankee Votives! It truly means a lot that you guys "made it right"!!!
Happy Valentine's Day everyone! We hope that you have a wonderful day and wanted to let you know we each and every one of you. We're sending you a virtual hug :-)
Baubles, and bubbly and love notes OH MY! What did you get for Valentines Day?
I'm beginning to think that the post office must be throwing away my BB&B coupons. I used to get them like clockwork (and spent them as such, too!), and now nothing. Haven't gotten the 20% off mailed coupon since at least November. I already re-signed up for the emails and mailing list. What gives? 
Instead of ordering from your local pizzeria or pulling a frozen pie from the freezer, why not make your own pizza. Better yet, get the whole family to help. Making the dough is surprisingly easy in your food processor. Then you can let everyone get creative with the toppings. Heres how to do it http://ow.ly/3PBo9
The final days of winter (we hope) are the perfect time for big, steaming bowls of homemade chili. Heres a hearty and heart healthy turkey chili you can make in your slow cooker. Delicious. http://ow.ly/3PBxi
We carry LOTS of flavors of coffee and tea for your Keurig and Tassimo brewers. (Remember, not every store carries all flavors but theyre all available on our website and ALL with free shipping in the 50 states and DC) Whats your favorite flavor? http://ow.ly/3PBCi
Oh BB&B I have to thank you so much for having a good supply of Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice K-Cups at your Westbury, NY store! I could not believe it. It was like coming across a gold mine! When the CS rep from there told me on the phone that they had "a lot", I didn't think he meant THAT many!! I bought 14 boxes ;) And some other K-Cups for my father. Also got the bed skirt I've been looking for.. No purple Wamsutta duvet cover in my bed size, but I ordered it from the site, so it's okay! (Though it would have been nicer to not pay shipping, and find it in the store!!). I really want to go back and get even more of the K-Cups because I know it's seasonal, my favorite, and won't be made again until Fall!! THANK YOU FOR HAVING THEM!!!!!!!! It made my day/week/month ;)
Attn fans: You pick our profile pic! Last month's feedback was amazing so hook us up again by voting for which you'd like to be our profile pic for March. Voting is easy with the interactive poll, click on the blue arrow to get started. Cant wait to see which one you choosebirds or blooms the suspense is killing us!
Bed Bath & Beyond, I wanted to THANK YOU (AGAIN)!!!! It really means a lot, when a company stands up, admits it was their mistake, and takes care of the issue/customers (even though it was a price mistake on the Yankee Candle Votives). Thank you SO VERY MUCH. I've been a BB&B customer for over 6 years, and I will continue to be one. Thanks for making it right!! John
Fact or fiction: Fabric softener has no effect on Towels? FICTION! Softeners coat fibers and can affect the absorbency of your towels- just pushing the water around.
Lots of people around the US are dealing with some crazy weather. Good news! Punxsutawney Phil didnt see his shadow this morning, predicting an early spring. If you were a groundhog, whats the one item from BBB you couldn't live without while hibernating all winter?
Everyone, We are aware of the pricing error and are working to correct that on our website. Please rest assured we will gladly honor the price for all existing orders placed for the incorrect price. We are sorry for any confusion and inconvenience. Thanks to everyone for bringing this to our attention and rest assured that we value our customers.

Comfort food for mammoth hunters. At the end of the last ice age, the guys supposedly hunting woolly mammoth were most often eating rabbits. Here a thick rabbit stew is presented with roast cauliflower with grated cheese and some oven roast potatoes in the background.
Comfort food. This is a quick tomato sauce that takes less than twenty minutes to make and is always on the list when the weather is cold and I want something that can be done in the time it takes to cook the pasta.
Comfort food abstract. This is a great Tex-Mex fusion of forbidden rice, banana leaf pulled pork tamales, black beans and home made tomatillo hot sauce.

I made the Hungry Girl's Pizza-Fied Chicken today for lunch. It was AWESOME!
there is something wrong with your page. is impossible to get any recipes from your site. It just keeps saying operation aborted. Please fix otherwise what is the sense in watching your channjel 
Just saw a show on making pasta. Does anyone know why you should add salt to the water when cooking fresh pasta? Seems to me you could just add it to the dough. Store bought pasta might not be sallty enough and i can understand why some might want more but if you are making it yourself you can make it as salty as you like. Is it to make the water hotter?

Hi Cooking Channel! I hope that you will invite Clara Gonzalez to your show and let her share some Dominican recipes. She has over 6,000 fans on facebook! She also has her own wesbite (dominicancooking.com) and wrote "Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook." Something to think about, hmmm :-)

Dear Cooking Channel, OOZY is not something I want my food to be ... melty or creamy or gooey maybe, but not oozy! UUUGGGGGGHHHHHH!
I love the cooking channel but I have a problem with it's favofite catch phrase. Is it just me or is there something wrong with the phrase "Stay Hungry"? Isn't the idea to learn hoe to satisfy one's hunger? Why on earth would I 'Stay Hungry'? Makes me think that what I see won't do the job for me. I think that I would say something like "Hunger Satisfied"....hmmmm
I love cooking channel but, I have issues with the saying "Stay Hungry". Makes me think that I am not going to learn, see or experience what I need to do the job of quelling my appetite. Maye something like "Hunger Satisfied" would be a more fitting phrase?...hmmmm In the mean time, I'll go make lunch....lol
I really like the show Extra Virgin!!
Hi all, I have a question. I really love how "foam" looks with the main dish, but not sure how. I saw a beet foam sitting on a salad tonight, wonder how its done. 
TGIFood! What's on your baking agenda for the weekend? We've got monkey bread for a ski trip.
~ QUESTION , I'm gonna start doing my popcorn from scratch,"any advice on what type of Pot or Pan i should use or purchase,and little secrets you might have or tips" THANKS ! :-)

We absolutely love the Extra Virgin show! Keep them coming. The two of them are amazing together - passion in life together and in the kitchen...
I love Extra Virgin.. what a wonderful story all around.
LOVE EXTRA VIRGIN... Debi and Gabriele are great... he cooks some great dishes... I am jealous of his cooking
Extra Virgin is my new favorite show. I love their energy and I love how its not just instruction. GREAT SHOW!
Grilled Chicken, Pasta and Fresh Tomato with a little parm to cover!
I really want to like the Cooking Channel, but I can't stand the camera work on many of the shows. All these out-of-focus, extreme closeups, and quick cutaways are annoying and they're giving me vertigo. Please, just show us what the person is doing in a straightforward way and save the artsy-fartsy stuff for something else.
I just love the new Cooking Chanel; something of interest for every age, food lover, wine afficiado, etc. They have the most inspirational shows on cable that I have ever seen! The new lineup is superb! Keep it coming! 
i just bought some ginger for the first time whole not young and im not relly shure what to do with it any suggestions?

I watched Chuck's Day Off - Play Date and he pickled veggies for the children. I looked online and all the recipes from that show were listed but this one. I would like to make this with my preschool class. Could I PLEASE get the recipe?
If you havn't seen the show "Extra Virgin" be sure to DVR it. They raise chickens too!!
Finally after many years and much trial and error, I've mastered the art of an excellent homemade mac and cheese! Heavy cream and a small amount of gouda cheese make it incredibly creamy!
I had a thought. With all the diabetics in society today, how do you think a program or segment devoted to diabetc cooking and alternatives to common ingredients that would be more diabetis friendly might fly? We have programming devoted to weight management, this is just a bit more specialized, and is certainly not a fringe issue.
The very best to do when you know your going to busy, just make it up ahead of time and it will be fresh, home made and tastier than fast food!
My favorite NEW show is Extra Virgin with Debi Mazar and Gabriele Corcos! I love watching them cook and play and enjoy each other and their children and friends! They remind me of Lucy and Desi but focusing on cooking and sharing! I hope they continue to cook and share with us for a long time to come!!!
So LOVE the show Chucks Day Off. Just got all my recipes for Thanksgiving!!!

SuperBowl: I ended up making only FOUR sliders... thus a TON of this delish pulled pork left over. I don't particularly like sliders. Therefore what to do for dinner 2-nite
Food Person of the Week! Kenny's Bacon Maple Bar Recipe 5 to 6 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup sugar 1 tsp salt 2 packages active dry yeast 1 1/4 cups milk 1/3 cup butter or margarine 2 eggs (we use 1/2 cup mashed potatoes, instant or real) 1. In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour with sugar, salt, and yeast. In 1-quart saucepan over low heat, heat milk and butter until very warm (120-130F).(Butter does not need to melt completely) 2. With mixer at low speed, beat liquid into dry ingredients. At medium speed, beat in eggs; beat 2-minutes more. Beat in 3/4 cup flour or enough to make thick batter; beat 2 minutes more. Stir in about 1 3/4 cups flour to make soft dough. 3. On floured surface, knead dough until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Shape into ball; place in greased large bowl; turn to grease top. Cover with towel; let rise in warm place, away from draft, until doubled, about 1 hour. 4. Punch down dough; turn onto lightly floured surface. Cut dough in half; cover with bowl; let rest 15 minutes. Grease 2 cookie sheets. 5. Roll one half of dough 1/4 to 1/2" thick. Using 2 3/4" round biscuit cutter, cut circles. Repeat with remaining dough and trimmings. 6. Place circles on cookie sheets; cover with towels and let rise in warm place (80-85F), until doubled, about 1 hour. Stretch each circle a little before frying. 7. In deep-fat fryer, heat 1" oil to 370F. Fry 4 to 5 doughnuts at a time until golden brown, 45 seconds to 1 minute on each side, turning once with slotted spoon. 8. Drain on paper towels. Lay out on wax paper to cool 2 or 3 minutes. While still warm (not burning hot) dip in frosting (recipe below) and then put back on wax paper. Frosting (Kenny's Recipe) All measurements are approximate, you might have to practice to get it to dipping consistency. 1/2 cup butter (or margarine) butter is better small can of evaporated milk (about 3/4 cup) 1 cup of brown sugar 2 tsp of maple flavoring 1 pound box of powdered sugar (depends on how thick or thin you want the frosting) In saucepan melt the butter add milk and brown sugar, heat until just bubbly. Take off heat and add flavoring. Add powdered sugar with wisk to get smooth. Dip maple bars in frosting. Covers 45 small maple bars depending on how much frosting you want on each. Once the donuts are frosted place a slice of cooked, drained/patted dry with paper towel and cooled bacon over each delicious donut. I personally like the bacon crumbled all over but that is me!
It's on right now! Followed by: Doughnut French Toast!
Healthy Pork Stroganoff... Tender, roasted pork in a creamy and tangy dill sauce on a bed of light and fluffy Black Forest-style egg noodles and served with a side of sauteed Haricot Verts, lightly tossed in spice and herb-infused extra virgin olive oil and whole, roasted garlic cloves. NOTE: This version contains all the flavor and texture of the classic Stroganoff, but is lighter and healthier and is similar to all of my dishes where you don't have to sacrifice flavor by making it healthy.

Hi Bobby! I belong to Edison Nation (it's a forum and website for inventors) and there is a guy named Darwin Roth who has accomplished something I think you might get a big kick out of! If you get a minute to spare you might want to take a peek!
Hi, will you open up a Burger Palace in NYC or Queens?
Are you going to have a special Valentine's Day menu for MGLV?
Bobby did you ever plant the crocus for your own saffron? 
I loved getting the newsletter including the Valentine's recipes. Thank you! I can't wait to try the recipes. 
I have been to the Mesa Grill in NY and it was great. My husband and I had brunch at Bar Americain in NY last Valentines Day. The food was great, but my problem is the lack of gluten free options. After a mix up at Bar Americain, being served food with flour after explaining about my needing all food to be gluten free, I wonder if you will be offering any gluten free options? I would love to go back, but can't risk it.
My husband and I celebrated on our honeymoon at Mesa Grill at Atlantis in the Bahamas! Food was amazing and we had the most delicious white peach margaritas -- is the recipe for the margaritas posted anywhere? My mouth waters just thinking about it!
My husband and I were so happy when Bar Americain opened at Mohegan Sun so we have one much closer than NYC. Now we're just waiting for a Mesa Grill here too! I can't wait for the Bar Americain cookbook to come out- when I met you at RJJulia's, your publicist had said some time soon....

Hey Bobby, huge fan! If you're ever out Niagara Falls way again look me up. I challenge you to a breakfast cook off....lets give new meaning to crab cakes benedict! 
Mesa Grill Vegas is our fav place. I have also made your duck tacos with corn pancakes at home...so awesome! I was just there in January, and was, almost, disappointed when our server said the menu hasn't changed. Naturally, I didn't have a problem ordering my favs, but it would be nice to see some new items. I'll go back even if I have to eat the same old stuff ;)
thinking of making a glaze for a ham. gonna bake it for a few hours with some water, brown sugar, pineapple maraschine cherries, honey and half a can of sprite (which i'll add during the last hour of cooking) How exactly do you make a glaze? I've used confectioner sugar with warm water in the past for donuts but it either burns or turns out extremely runny. is there a way i could use the pineapple and cherries to make a glaze? and if so, how would i wan to do that without ruining my ham?
hey bobby, i know your the burger guy, but i am looking for a favor. inbox me please. i am tying to do somthing for some one 
Praying for a Mesa Grill to come to Orange County, CA (or Los Angeles)...I would probably live there. :)

Hey, Bobby.... how about a Thai food throwdown at Kwan Thai in Pearl River?
Hi Bobby - I'm a big fan and also an avid marathon runner (broke the world record last year as the youngest woman to run a marathon in all 50 states). I've read a lot about how you were trying to break 4:00 in NYC, and wondered if you were interested in having me pace you next year? I ran 3:56 in NYC two years ago, and in 2010 I worked with tennis pro Justin Gimelstob to win the 4:45 bet he had going with Andy Roddick; we finished well under that (4:10). Feel free to drop me a line either here or at laura@50by25.com and I'm happy to provide more credentials.
hi bobby! when you were in nashville for throwdown a couple years ago, did you have time to try any local restaurants? just curious if you had any memorable meals while in town...
Hey Bobby, love all your shows and finally have the privelage of eating at one of your restaraunts for the first time. I am taking my girlfriend to Mesa Grill in Las Vegas for Valentines Day.

Hello bobby was wondering if you have a drop dead recipe for rum cake ?
Hi Bobby. My 12-year old loves your show and wants to challenge you to a latke Throwdown. She is actually quite a fantastic cook and has learned cooking techniques from your (and others') shows and your book. She is beyond making PBJ sandwiches, mac-n-cheese or other "kid" foods. Her latkes are very good with our family's secret ingredient. Consider this a Throwdown challenge! :)
Hi Bobby, My 11 year old son is autistic but has been a fan of yours and thinks that you are a wonderful chef, because of you he has a dream to be a chef someday. He feels were you can come up with your own reciepes he can too and he has and they are pretty good for a little boy. So I wanted to say thank you for making him see that he can have his dream because he sees you and watches all of your shows.
Hi Bobby, My 12 year old son has just made your classic fried chicken and it came out awesome. And we ate at the MESA grill at Atlantis. Yummy
Lamb and Black Bean Chili was a huge hit last night. Thanks for another great recipe!
Bobby - my grandmother & mother saw you about a week ago at BBP in Mohegan Sun. You stopped your meal to take a picture with my grandma. She knows you are my favorite chef are wanted to send me the picture. Just wanted to say thank you very much!
Bobby, did you know that the mega - hit online game "World of Warcraft" has a Chef Robby Flay and a Chef Bario Matalli? Chef Flay gives the daily cooking quests, and today's quest requires us to collect juicy apples for making the King's favorite beverage, apple cider. Other than cinnamon, what would you add to cider to make it awesome?
Hi Bobby ... i Love all of your shows... especially throw-down....our family (who are hearing impaired) own and operate a pierogi shop in Roselle Park N.J. I was wondering if you were ever challenged with a " pierogi" throw-down??? it would be interesting.... my sister and i are not hearing impaired and help our parents run their business. Our pierogis are the BEST!! I'm sure you have seen them in various specialty supermarkets...Whole Foods, Dagostino's etc. I'd love to hear back from you.Thanks! ~ Vanessa 
Take a trip down to Anderson SC and throw down with the best of the best. New York Pizza. Cmon' man. be spontaneous. Or just come to check us out. f'getabout it.
Bobby have you ever considered adding a veggie burger to the menu at BBP? I'm a big fan and would love to go sometime, but I've been a vegetarian since childhood.
Bobby I had a question...when it comes to braising meats, does it make a huge difference cooking in a dutch oven as opposed to a crock pot?Besides time?Like does the meat taste better in a dutch oven?Thank you!
Hi Bobby...Question...Why is it when I make fried chicken (buttermilk dipped then flour dipped) and fry it, the outside of the chicken is nice and crunchy but the center of my chicken is usually rare slightly. I have no resort but to bake it after for 15 minutes? What am I doing wrong??? Is the temperature of the oil wrong?? Help me please!!!
Bobby i love your shows when you cook Hispanic foods. The only thing that really bugs me is when your making a burrito or taco. you don't warm your tortilla. you use it right out the bag. Alot of us Hispanics warm the tortillas on the stove or grill. I must say though I think you cook closer to a hispanic then most! I always look forward to your shows. 
How do you know how long to cook a burger without a thermometer?
Hi , Bob I just watched your show 2-8-11 it was my first time . I LOVED IT !!!!! Last July My hubby bought me a small mobile concession stand for my birthday.. I was able to do three events last yr.

I have some famliy recipes that I plan to use. Thank you Mari

dear bobby, when are you touring again and what are your tour dates?
Hi Bobby--is there any was I can obtain a copy of the Thanksgiving Throwdown episode with Ree Drummond? I've been trying unsuccessfully to track it down. Thank you!! --Joanna in Las Vegas
Congrats on winning the throw down against Jimmy! Now you can bump that 4% up to 5%. ;) Hopefully this will make you chuckle, but my mom a few months back was confused about the name of your throw down show. Instead of calling it "Throw Down with Bobby Flay," she called it "Slam Down with Bobby Flay." And for some reason, that has a really good ring to it... Anyway, it was great seeing you win a throw down. :)
Hi Bobby, Love your shows. My kids especially love the throw downs. We build reclaimed kitchen island and are starting a new line of Grilling tables. Would love your input.
Thanks for the Sherry Dijon Vinagrette recipe for my Roasted Beets! YUMMY!
Bobby i just watched extreme makeover, and let me tell you i though that was very nice of you to go on and show the dad how to cook. 
Hi Bobby, just wanted to say watching you cook has inspired me to love cooking. I love to fire up the bbq as much as possible; being from California you know that makes it easy. We are heading to your Mesa Grill in Las Vegas next month, and I am certainly looking forward to tasting your menu.
Can you please please please open a restaurant in Colorado so my brother will stop bragging about how he gets to eat all of your food in NY and I can have some too??
Ok Chef Flay , where do you hide your Super Man cape at? Just saw the preview for Next Great Restaurants! Wow you are unstoppable and I love it! Keep it coming! And, when will you be coming to San Diego again? My three year old boy Connor is just crazy about you too.
Hello Bobby Flay, I am a big fan of yours. I was just woundering what you would say to me that would help me start my own restaurant? I come from a low class family, so i don't have the money for a nice school. So I have to do with what i have and that is with my brains and my hands. So please if you could help, from one Irish to another. Thanks Amanda
Going to Phoenix/Scottsdale, AZ. Do you have any Tex-Mex restaurants to recommend?
My gf and I are big big fans. We watch all your shows, and were going to travel several hundred miles to try that coconut cake you guys threw down in Charleston, but couldnt find the time. Hope to geta response.
Hi, I just wanted to know how long to cook a steak medium well without a thermometer?
Hey Bobby just a BIG BIG thank you!! Your recipes make me look like king of the hill, I have never had so many complements on my cooking.. lol.. It kinda hurts to tell them it is not my own creation lol.. yes you get the credit... BUT like any good cook we all modify a little and tweak a little extra flavor with surprise so that is my secrete.. Again thanks for sharing.. God bless you bro 
My favorite potato salad comes from his first cookbook..
Dear Bobby: We have a restaurant in Carlsbad, Ca ...Bobbys Hideaway and of course, we have famous Bobs on our wall. Our Bob is a gormet cook and just loves you. We are missing a picture of you!!! It would hold a place of honor. Could we contact someone to obtain a signed picture???
A few months ago, you were in DC and visited Cava? What did you think? When is your DC restaurant opening?
Bobby, what do you do to talapia and other fish to take the fishy taste out of it?
Hi Bobby, just got back from a family trip to puerto rico and my girls have already been begging for some sweet plantains. Not something I've played with in the kitchen before, I knew you'd have a yummy recipe on the food network site. Very happy kids I'll have tomorrow night. Gracias!
I have tried the Dulce de Leche recipe from the Mesa cook book page 236 several times and the caramel never gets firm. I have used the exact ingredients. It is very runny so I never go on the make the chocolate cakes. Any thoughts on what I could be doing wrong?
If you can't eat peppers due to allergies - what can be substituted for peppers in the recipe?
Hi Bobby, I just made your Throwdown winning spaghetti and meatballs, and my entire family (including six kiddos!) absolutely loved it!! My hubby just went on and on about it, and the children declared it the best spaghetti I've ever made. I'm really enjoying the Throwdown cookbook, the stories as well as the recipes!! Next up- the sweet potato crusted chicken potpie!! Keep the yumminess comin'. :-)
I'll be participating in a competitive cooking show on national French television called, "Un diner presque parfait". I want to show break the old stereotype the French have on Americans eating poorly and not knowing how to cook. Here's my French-American menu for the show. Any advice? Aperitif: The French Kiss- home cooked fois gras shaped into lips with a coulisse de fruits rouges on top Entr: Cesar Salad (I've lived in France for 7 years and have yet to find a place that serves this. I want to introduce them to an American favorite) Main Dish: Sliders (a recipe for making mini-buns?) 1. Aubergine, BBQ sauce (help! i can't find all the ingredients/spices here to make your recipe), red cabbage, onion, honey. 2. Magret de Canard and Goat Cheese (any other cheese with duck and what can go on top?) 3. a 3rd slider? Dessert: Cheesecake with coulisse de fruits rouges again with homemade whipped cream 
Happy valentine, Bobby!:) 
Do you have a listing of your personal appearances somewhere? 
I was making the Santa Fe Burger from "Burgers, Fries and Shakes" tonight for the first time, but my queso sauce had a grainy texture. I eat this type "dip" in Mexican restaurants all the time and it is so creamy and smooth. Where did I go wrong? Thanks!
Do you do N.Y. Style Pizza Throw Downs? 
Standing in Stormwind in the internet game WOW and looking at Robby Flay heheheh he wants me to catch 5 gigantic catfish to fix for the king... lol
Bobby, what about Americas Next Great Restaurant Chain? Do you just show up at the location or fill out an application online? 
 Bobby, my friend owns a thai restaurant and I'm trying to help her come up with a peanut sauce for her Spring Rols...any suggestions? I need your help!
Bobby, are you going to open a restaurant in Los Angeles or Orange County?
Can people just show up for the casting for Americas Next Great Restaurant in NYC. Me and you are going to open some restaurants! Bobby!!!! Can you "inbox message" me details if you know any
Everyone wants a piece of Bobby and so do we at Husky Stadium for a little tailgating in Seattle. Check out Friends of Frank on FB Bobby. 
I copied the recipie for your Chimichurri Sauce from your show--but forgot to write down what it's used for. :( Love your shows.
Bobby I would like to challange you in a throw down are you ready to make a chili BC style? Im going to have a chili cook off April 2nd and it would be honor to have you in the parking lot with all of the Valemount locals to challange me and my team. 
Would you consider a BBQ cook-off competing you with local North Carolina BBQers in an event to celebrate recovery from alcohol and substance abuse? September is National Recovery Month and I'm trying to get an event off the ground that shows support for those in recovery and direction for those who would like to go into recovery.
i just heated up some leftover chicken Teriyaki from last night and is using Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce as a dip. damn!
Who will be in South Beach next week for the SOBE Wine and Food Festival? I'll be at the popular Burger Bash with my team serving up burgers on Thurs night. WIll also be hosting Bubble Q on Friday night.
Dear Bobby , Bobby's Burger Palace in West Philly is the best place i have ever eaten at. Service was phenomenal, every one greeted us with a smile and seemed happy to be working there. The Miami Burger was the best burger ive ever eaten. To any one else reading this ... You must go to one and try it. Great Food, Great Prices, Great Service... the best triple threat available. Thank You 
Mesa Grill Restaurant Week continues this week. Try the Salmon Griddled Cake with Cilantro Vinaigrette & Tomatillo Salsa, Grilled Mahi Mahi with New Mexico Red Curry Sauce & Creamy Green Chile Rice and Warm Banana Cake with Caramel and Crushed Peanuts. http://www.mesagrill.com./new-york-city-restaurant/menus.php
Chef Flay, I've tasted the best pizza in Miami, NY, LA, Chicago,but there is a pizza place in New Haven,CT the best pizza I've ever tasted.It's called Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, have you ever gone there? 
just watching your cattacori throw down, and think i have merit!!!! come to my house and we can throw down
On my way to SOBE. Lots of stuff to do. First up..The Burger Bash on Thursday night. I and my team will be serving the Napa Burger ..crunchified, of course. What is your all-time favorite burger toppings?
Just ate at your Paramus location. We traveled about 2 hours to get there and let me tell you it was WELL WORTH THE TRIP!! We will be back for sure!! Thank you!! The best burger by far!!
Hi chef. Can you post the recipe you used to make the steak sauce mayo from your throwdown wed night? it looked awesome and sounded so good.
glad you enjoyed the TD...if you are in Philly you have to try..otherwise, just make my recipe...ha ha
Watched the Vegas cocktail "Throwdown" last night. Awesome creativity with those ingredients!
Hey Bobby how about a Burger Palace here in the deep south. Would love to have you near us.. Dunwoody, Ga near Perimeter Mall or Alpharetta Ga near Northpoint Mall..north of Atlanta. Your my favorite Chef...
Chef Bobby, any chance of you adding a Bobby's Burger Place to Orlando? 
HI Bobby. I have a question: What, if anything, is the difference between polenta & grits ? I know cornmeal is the base for both. Is it that 1 is italian & 1 southern American ? BTW, I'm sure U R enjoying thawing out on South Beach this weekend. We live about 20 miles northwest of there just aross the county line.
Bobby you are so cool and so much fun to watch. I just hate when my meal doesn't turn out like yours:( Have a great weekend.
Congrats to my good friend and fellow Iron Chef Michael Symon for winning the Best Dressed Burger award (for the second year in a row) at Rachael Ray's Burger Bash at SOBE last night. His burger with fried salami, provolone and a spicy mustard sauce was killer. What a great event!
Bobby Flay, I just made my original Botto's Italian Sausage, Broccoli Rabe and Provolone Soup, There is no way you can beat that in a throwdown... Don't be scared!!! or should you. Chef Enrico Botto
Hey Bobby! Just ate at MESA in Las Vegas again last Saturday night and will be going again in a couple of weeks. One of the best restaurants in the country!!
Chef Flay - We ate at MESA in Vegas a few years back. After I got home, I tried to duplicate the rub on a fillet I had. I believe it contained, among other spices and herbs, coffee grounds. Is the recipe for that rub available? It was, without a doubt, the best piece of beef I've ever put in my mouth! Wish I could justify a trip to Vegas every time I had a hankering for a good steak.... just don't think my bank account would go for it. Thanks!
I have a cook book Idea I have been working on and wanted to know your thoughts and maybe get some guidance on how to proceed. I would really appreciate any advice or ideas, message if you have time. 
Chipotle pure. Where on earth do you find that?
Hi Bobby - This spring, I'm going to be traveling to Washington D.C. for the first time. Would you have any "must try!" restaurant recommendations for that area? Oh, and thanks to Iron Chef, I made a point of going to Chef Besh's Restaurant August when I was in NOLA and it was amazing. Now if I could just make a trip to one of the cities with a Bobby Flay restaurant . . .
Hi Bobby...how do I get in touch with you directly..My name is Bob Roberts and I'm incharge of the cullinary demo at this years Shores of Erie Wine Festival in Amherstburg Ontario Canada.I'm interested in finding out what the cost would be to invite you to do a demonstration.This is a world class festival that see's over 20,000 visitors over this weekend in September.Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated...Thanks B
Working my way through "Throwdown"! I almost cried when my brother gave it to me for Christmas. He got to see you in Houston and got me a signed copy! SOOOO jealous he got to meet you but I love my new book! ;)
Big fans of yours in our house, Bobby! We just started our own mango hot sauce line here in SWFLA! I can totally see it sitting next to your grill, LOL! :P 
Big fan, Bobby! My 6 year old wants to grow up to be a chef, I can only hope he sticks with it and enjoys it as much as you and you colleagues do. I know 6 is young, but a calling is a calling.
HI Bobby. I have a question: What, if anything, is the difference between polenta & grits ? I know cornmeal is the base for both. Is it that 1 is italian & 1 southern American ? BTW, I'm sure U R enjoying thawing out on South Beach this weekend. We live about 20 miles northwest of there just aross the county line. 
Is the market for smoked food catering too saturated or is there room for another player in the game?
I made it a point to visit your restaurant in Vegas last weekend (because I am your biggest fan!) and I have to say that was some of the best 16 spice mango chicken, mashed potatoes and greens that i've ever had in my life!!! I love you Bobby!!!! 
LOVE the THROWDOWN! Cookbook...Got it for my husband for Valentine's Day and we had a great time making your winner - chicken pot pie. It was heavenly and worth all of the effort! Love your show and the cookbook!
Had my 1st burger from Bobbys Burger Palace in Mohegan recently. It was amazing!!! I was so excited to be having a Bobby Flay burger!
I just read about your cruncified burgers. I've always put a layer of potato chips in my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
Hey chef here is one my burgers, it was the bomb! I am a student Le Cordon Bleu School Of Culinary Arts and have about ten years experience in the industry, would love to train under you and be apart of your team.
Today is the first day of The Louisiana Burger at BBP. Spice rubbed burger with tasso ham, pepper jack cheese and remoulade sauce. Let the Good Times Roll!
Yankee's Pitchers and Catchers report to camp today! Who do you think will win the World Series this year?
We're just back from vaction in Vegas. Mesa Grill is AWESOME!!! We had a fantastic experience, delicious wine & an amazing meal! We live on Long Island, so now cant wait to visit your NY location. Yummmm (pic is me...practically licking my plate!)

Love my trip out to see the guys at work! Lots of fun and excellent fish!
Yesterday Brock & Salk paid us a visit and celebrated their two year anniversary by catching fish with our own Chris Bell! Hey Yaaaaaaaaaaaah!
We had lots of fun with you all this morning! Thanks for being so great! :) I also look forward to reading the new "Catch!" book you recommended! We look forward to visiting again in a few months. PS: The smoked salmon was fabulous! Next time we will have to take some back home. THANKS AGAIN! :)

I got this message to day from the gentlemen that was forced to pay these fees. "I talked to UPS Canada today and the UPS store in Ohio should have informed you that there was an import cost involved to Canada and you could have made a decision to ship here or not based on the final cost , they have to let you know of these added costs !! The term the UPS rep told me was ( Free Domicile ) that means it was sent from your house to my house and no cost was involved , this also means you the shipper would see the shippings cost plus the import cost ( if any ) and decide to cover all or none of the cost . They gave me a fax number to send complaints to : 1 770 990 1724 , you would have to inclued the tracking number , account number . I`m not sure what luck you`ll have but i`d call the UPS American Reps ASAP to complain."
I have used UPS for the past 4 years for my work and now have my own personal Account. I have not had any problems with domestic shipping. International fees are killer so i go postal with those. But i just want to thank all the great drivers From the Doraville, GA Hub that have done a great job on my route. Keep it up! Thanks!
Dear UPS, I had to packages bring delivered today, one from UPS and one from your competitor FEDEX. To make a long story short FEDEX just left after delivering my package. However, I get an email that your company is holding up my package due to adverse weather conditions. How come you can't deliver today but FEDEX can? I guess I'll have to start using them more in the future. 
My UPS packages may be delayed due to the weather, how long might this delay be? It is coming out of Addison, Illinois going to Appleton, Wisconsin.
Ok...decided UPS is not living up to expectations. If you can't deliver due to weather, how about updating the website and sending an email. 
Seriously UPS you have to be the worst shipping company out there. I should have sprung the extra cash to ship with someone else. I had no problems driving to work today in downtown Chicago, yet you cant move your trucks? USPS was able to deliver mail, why cant you? AND THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION. That is the nail in the coffin. At least some kind of eta instead of this lame blank answer. "Weather conditions might delay delivery of this shipment. This is the most current information available. Please track again later for status updates." Its been sitting there for 2 days now. 
Mr. Barnes, Sr VP, Chief Information Officer...Here's one to work on. How about an email blast to business accounts when UPS decides to shut down pick-up and deliveries due to bad weather. I have no problem with UPS closing due to severe weather. I do have a problem having to learn about it from my suppliers, and not UPS directly. Even on our log-in site, MyUPS.com there was no mention of this. This is an easy one to fix. I hope you do. Kelly / West Michigan

I don't know whats going with UPS but seeing all of the complaints everyone seems to be having the same problem here's my tracking info: 01/31/2011 7:00AM adverse weather conditions 02/01/2011 6:20 AM Out For Delivery 02/01/2011 9:23 PM Emergency conditions beyond UPS' control. 02/02/2011 3:46 AM Out For Delivery 02/02/2011 4:28 PM The customer was not available on the 1st attempt. A 2nd attempt will be made. 02/03/2011 4:08 A.M. Out For Delivery 02/03/2011 3:30 P.M. The customer was not available on the 1st attempt. A 2nd attempt will be made. I'm in NY and there isn't much snow both FED-EX and the USPS have been delivering with no problem AND both times that they claimed they tried to deliver I was home and no one from UPS ever rang my bell I got deliveries from both FEDEX and the USPS today and yesterday..Where is my package UPS?????
I hate you guys so much!! what is this? "The package was missed at the destination location. / Package will be delivered next business day." Come on guys!! Why are you so slow? it was a great day outside!! awful service!! FEDEX was making deliveries all day long!!! really bad experience!!
alright.. so.. my package said it had a departure scan today... at 10 this morning.. at a place 5 hours away from me.. why hasn't the package been delivered to the next ups place? why is there no scheduled delivery date? 
Gotta say that I love your Tracking System. Always has up to date information. I can see exactly where my package is at. :) Thank you!

I have been awaiting a UPS delivery for about five days. Today was supposed to be the 3rd and final attempt, so I rushed home to wait for it. I skipped a social engagement to wait for the package, as it is very important. After calling the 800 number to make sure that they had not come yet, I stood by the door for THREE HOURS from 5pm - 8pm. The package did not come. At 8pm I called the automated line, where I was told that the package was "attempted to be delivered at 7:06pm." This is a complete lie, as I was STANDING AT MY GLASS DOOR BETWEEN 5PM AND 8PM. My doorbell did not ring, and surprisingly, no door tag was left. UPS is lying about the delivery attempt and is now forcing me to go out of my way to pick up a package that was supposed to be delivered. I have been trying to get a live person on the phone but they cannot answer my call due to a "high volume of calls." UPS, please rectify this ridiculous and embarrassing situation immediately.
You wanna know what Brown can do for me? You can deliver my package like you're paid to do.
UPS CUSTOMER SERVICE SUXS! WHY HAVE THEM IF YO CAN FIND THE SAME EACT INFO ONLINE? waiting on package for 12 days and has been here in town 4 days and says ou for delivery on 3 different occasions, twice in last 2 days and still i have no package!
Stuff happens and we understand when things are out of your control; however, when your customer service continues to lie to a customer 4 times in a night when there is extreme wind and snow and say that a package will be delivered, then change your status 5 minutes after the 4th call with bad information; this is when customers get upset. I had a FedEx package that was also caught in the same storm, and still managed to make it to my house before your package and it was Shipped 2 days later, I think you should be highly embarrassed.
Finally got my package yesterday, even though it was supposed to come on Thursday. I can understand a day or two of delays due to the snow storm...but not 4! Everyday I checked, the package was supposed to be delivered that day, yet by dinner time, there was always an excuse or sometimes nothing. For example, on Monday, it wasn't delivered due to "adverse weather conditions." Too bad I live close to where the distribution center is. There was only a little snow (maybe a 1/2 inch accumulation, if that)...definitely not enough to delay a package (especially since the distribution center is in the same town as USPS and I never missed getting mail!!) I sent an email about this and only got a reply saying it had been delivered. I am frustrated with the lack of customer service and care. I am seriously thinking about switching to FedEx or just using the USPS next time. 
I just love how UPS will take your money for Expidited delivery but when they mess up it is the old "Bad Weather" excuse. If it is bad weather when you pick it up, you should state right then that I won't deliver this 2nd Day Air package so I won't charge you for 2nd Day Air shipping. What a freaking raquet they are running. How much moola do you think UPS has been making on Air deliveries this past 2-3 weeks that they have no intention of delivering on time. Still take the freaking money though.What a bunch of thieves!
Your service is terrible. I was told that my package could not be delivered due to "Emergency conditions beyond UPS' control". Why then did I see a UPS truck drive right by my mail box while I was out getting my mail? But they did not deliver to me. I also love how you cannot get a hold of a real live person to talk to when you try to call their 1-800 number.
On your way to and/or from the sun.... you obviously used my package to block impending and threatening asteroid attacks... For this package to be boxed and packed AND delivered by UPS - it looks like it was handled by butchers and put through a meat grinder!! It was clearly marked on all sides as FRAGILE HANDLE WITH CARE, I would hate to see how it was treated WITHOUT that label!! Booooo UPS... Major FAIL!
I really dont like UPS. Im opposed to using your services for anything. But sometimes, I order from places and you're the only option so i am forced to deal with you. How is it that I have packages that have been sitting in the local station (Mesquite, TX) 10 mins away from my house since Friday the 4th but there is a delay for "adverse weather conditions". The sun has been out the last two days and the roads are clear and you guys dont deliver on weekends. My mailman has come by everyday. FEDEX (my preferred carrier) drives to my complex everyday.... but not UPSh$%... i really hate your company and the lousy services you guys provide!!
When is the package I sent to TX on 2/1 going to be delivered? Packages that were sent after this are getting priority, I assume so they are not late. My 2/1 package is already late, so UPS doesn't give a rat's ars. How can you run a business like this? The weather has not been bad for 10 days in TX. Your customer service can't even give me a revised delivery date, I just have to hope every morning that it will get on the truck that day at the whim of some guy in Dallas. So frustrating. NE-VER again. 
Ughh always an issue with UPS. I've been patiently waiting for a package. Early this morning it was on the truck for delivery. There was just a UPS delivery at my office and the package didn't come. This guy better come back here today or I am going to be really really REALLY mad.
sooooo....... I got my post deleted due to something I wrote in it about the sorry customer service I had while on the phone to UPS CS. Then they send me a nice message telling me they deleted it and to e-mail them ......soooo I did and I have not heard back from the e-mail, guess my pkg is going back to the sender??
Well two packages one with 2 day delivery going on 7 days now, one with regular ground going on 10 days...adverse weather condition delays on days when there was no adverse weather here in TX. Called UPS @ 7:00pm on Friday and was told "That item shows on the truck for delivery, "I guarantee you it will be delivered today" (website still shows it on the truck for Friday). at 11:00pm I called and was told ummm that package was returned to the depot and rescheduled for MONDAY due to the high volume of undelivered packages. 
Thanks for NOT delivering my husbands Valentine's today, that I ordered on the 28th of last month. Maybe he'll get it tomarrow? Maybe not. I got the shipping conf from FTD on the 12th but no one can explain what happened. Nice Logistics you there, UPS.
I just wanted to thank you for crushing EVERY SINGLE piece of art that I get shipped through your service... 
I JUST WANTED TO THANK UPS FOR DAMAGING AND NOT DELIVERING MY GRANDSON BIRTHDAY PRESENT ON TIME!!! IT'S STRANGE HOW MANY TIMES THE PACKAGE WAS SCANNED AND NO ONE NOTICED THE PACKAGE WAS DAMAGED. IT WAS EVEN LOADED ON THE TRUCK AND SENT OUT FOR DELIVERY AND NO ONE NOTICED BUT AT 8PM THE DAMAGED WAS DISCOVERED AND NOW NO ONE IN CUSTMER SERVICE CAN TELL ME WHERE MY GRANDSON'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT IS. THANK YTOU UPS FOR THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY. I'LL BE USING FED EX FROM NOW ON!!! :((
Awesome. My new laptop that was supposed to be delivered early am this morning is at the distribution center in Williston, and I can't even go get it due to gross incompetence. Keep sucking, UPS.

rant part 1 your company is the worst. i cant express that feeling strong enough. THE ABSOLUTE WORST! from the way you layout your website (ie shipping policies are not on the check out page where the customer selects shipping options. even if this is an inadvertent oversight it is misleading to your customers), to the level of knowledge your "experts" allegedly possess (ordered the wrong part multiple times and relied on the customer to figure out what part i actually needed to order), to the blas attitude you have toward your customers time & financial resources (waiting for days to continually receive the wrong part combined with the multiple cab rides i had to pay for in order to correct your mistakes). in short, if you were doctors you'd be looking at a malpractice suit.
We had a customer get a flat in front of my store the other day while I was gone. One of my associates drove him across town with his flat to get another tire and dropped him off. 15 minutes later my employee got a call from the customer that the tire was replaced and he need a ride back. My associate went back and picked him up and my store made $0 off of it. Service is our best part! 
14" inches of snow fell overnight Tuesday, Opened the store Wed on time and also called our commercial customers and let them know we were delivering. The best part was the Zone's parking lot was not cleared until 11am and they closed by 5:30pm last night and we were business as usual. 
so fellow team members...a little question for a snowy night. What vehicle first got you interested in automobiles/favorite childhood automotive memory?

So, how about the other day we had our lovely neighbors at Autozone give us a lovely phone call. It turns out that they sold a customer a battery, uninstalled their old one, and found out that they didn't have the battery on stock. They asked if we could sell the customer a new one since they messed up. My ASM loaded up a battery and tools and sped right over. Installed the battery and had the customer follow him back to the store. How funny is it to have an Advance Auto truck in a Zone parking lot, installing a battery? I wish we had a camera at the time.

I think you should get out to each store and post a short story on the store and its employees. Take pics and under each person write something small about them. I think this would give customers a little family feel, instead of the business feel that you get in almost EVERY store you walk in to . The store i work in 6891 TIMBERVILLE,VA we are trying to connect more with our customers we started a board up so our customers and are employees can post their projects they have stirring up at home. Just a though running though me head.

Just want to let someone know how disappointed I am that I purchased one of the Tom Tom's yesterday via ebates.com and when I did it said that you had stock at your Colerain Avenue (Cincinnati, Oh) store. Imagine how surprised I was today when I drove all the way there to pick it up and was told that they were all gone. I was told there was a "gliche" in the computer. I think employees wanted them at that price and that they were there when I purchased it. Regardless, I am in a real pinch now because I told my customers that it was going to be a "door prize" at my computer class tomorrow!!! I am very upset about it if you can't tell!

I bought a cot from Big Bazaar Hyderabad. It was delivered in 5 days but the piece was damaged. The guy (mechanic) came for fitting didnot noticed it and started doing his job. when notified he asked me to take the cot to a welding shop and get that welded. when i have asked for a replacement. he gave me a (big story) process of getting that done. I have called up to the customer care 1800-200-2255 but no one picks up the call. I am lost now waiting for your process cycle to get effective. now i dont know how many days your guys will take to replace the cot....i feel as if i am cheated by BB...

they assured me that no problem they will give the missing parts whenever i come to gauhati.after they assured me i went on the 6 feb and i told them about my problem,but they told me there is no parts with them and they told me that they cannot help me... i have a feeling that as i am from outstation they purposely packed the bed with missing parts or give the parts to some one else..they even forced me to buy some mattresses with out discount price eventhough the price has been discounted already. I know I have been cheated so kindly help me what should i do...?. i did not expect this kind of deal from BIG Bazar.

I have a question for anybody that works at Food Lion. Why do you not sale weight watchers snacks? You sale some of the dinners and the icecream but no snacks. WHY?
I think that the company is a joke to work for. Employees are overworked, underpaid. They are lucky to hear a Thank You for anything that they do. Hours are being cut non stop, but the workload is being enlarged. All raises have been frozen, all Full time employees lost half of their holiday bonuses, and next yr I can imagine that the Part Time Associates will no longer recieve one. The company is so focused on keeping the stores clean, that customer service is almost non existent now in most stores. Employees are no longer happy and morale overall sucks! To me, that's no way to run a business. The employees of the store are the ones that keep it running smoothly, but it's the execs that get all the money and the perks. You have to respect the little people, because without them, your stores wouldn't run.
I really liked my job as a meat cutter and more importantly providing a great shopping experience and customer service for "my" customers. Its funny though, the store itself expresses no genuine friendliness or service attitude toward their customers, without sounding like it is required of their employees instead of being genuine. Since I have been fired for working off the clock, all my customers have informed me every where I see them that they are never shopping Food Lion again. They loved the service I provided for them, even when they would come after my time had lapsed, and this is where I got in trouble, having to work over to meet the needs of my regular customers. Doesn't make much sense, does it?
Food Lion could actually be a very good place to work if they would only learn how to treat employees with respect and a simple kindness. At 1313 Food Lion and most other stores in the area, Food Lion makes you feel expendable or worthless and very easily replaceable. I had to endure way too much stress and harassment for the three years I totally committed to giving them the best of my abilities. I would hate to think that they are so heartless that I would have no other choice but to sue this corporation that has abused my life so badly. When I wrong someone, I am compelled to make things right, to make restitution and repay and repair the damage and harm I've caused them. My ? is, "why wouldn't a huge corporation be willing to do the same since it is people that made them the success that they are?" 
your macaroni salad is really, truly horrible.
Thank you to ALL of my great customers who allowed me to have the pleasure of serving them here on Kent Island Md. I will miss you but look forward to serving you at the competitors. Thank you so much for your support and writing letters on my behalf to Food lion. Maybe they will listen
Thanks for your great promo when you bought two pizzas you gave us free garlic bread, wings and cookie dough! ;)
Love Food Lion in Powhatan Virginia! :)
The grocery store was jammed like Christmas Eve on Sunday.
You'll love all the ways to save this week at Food Lion. We have Boneless Ribeye Steak Value Packs for $5.88/lb., BOGO Progresso Soups, and Premium Long Stem Roses for only $19.95.
Since we are Coke fiends, always love specials on 2-liter bottles. And, of course, we we go for those specials, we have to stock up on pretty much all he other specials at the same time. In most cases, the Food Lion "brands" are the same quality as the so called "name" brands. I do wish "my" Food Lion would have a better selection of fresh veggies. I realize space is limited, but I still have my wishes. 
would like to see more coupons for meats
So, I shop at the FoodLion in Conyers. I've been there twice in the last 4 days....of the 6 BABY BUGGY's they have at this store, there are only 2 left!! It has been advised that people are STEALING THEM!! I just have to say, this saddens me tremendously! My little 3 year old girl, looks forward to going here at least once a week. And now, due to their being only 2 buggy's for her in the store....she' so upset!!! 
I enjoy shopping at my local food lion store you have fresh vegatables, and great meats
Just wanted to let you know that I loved the deal you had in your sale ad last week where you got the 3 free items when you bought 2 Red Baron pizzas! I hope you have more deals like that in the future!!
LOVE THE PRICES
hello foodlion associates i have a question regarding your new website, after you register mvp card it supposed to show your year to date 2011 savings i shopped today saved 7.91 cents on the website after i logged in it said my year to date savings was 0 how long does it take for website to recognize changes in savings amount to be posted???thanks
I just wanted to say thanks for carrying marshmallow fluff!! 
Food Lion I have loved your guiding stars game. Are you going to update it this week?
can I make a suggestion? Food lion in Florence SC needs non-diary ice cream. I love it but I'm allergic and I moved there from Myrtle Beach and they had non-diary ice cream. And now I miss it. Thank you! 
My daughter is at home sick in bed today and wanted to have a valentine treat to give to her class tomorrow at school for the class party. My hubby goes to Food Lion and texts her a picture on his cell phone of the variety of cookies for VDay so she can choose which ones to pick. Sad to say, he was escorted out of the store for taking a picture of the cookies. I am dissapointed in your actions - shame on you Food Lion for kicking out a father who was just trying to buy some cookies for his daughters class party. 
Food Lion- Do you plan on putting frozen concentrate orange juice on sale in the near future?

Food Lion store assists: CSX conductor critically injured in fall from bridge Published: February 10, 2011 COVINGTON, Va. A CSX conductor is in critical condition after falling 50 feet from a railroad bridge over the Jackson River, the Roanoke Times (Va.) has reported. It appears another CSX employee waded into the river to rescue Alvin Boguess, 24, Tuesday evening. Boguess was part of a three-person crew that was switching cars at MeadWestvacos Covington paper mill. Its unclear how he came to fall into the river. Friends of the Boguess family are holding a fundraiser to help the family from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. Saturday at the Covington Food Lion.
trivia question :)... what was on sale at Food Lion this week (ending 2/15) that came in the size 33.9 oz (2 lb + 1.9oz) and was on sale for $7.49 (or 3.54/lb). I wrote that down on a piece of paper while shopping & failed to write what the item was - now I can't remember! LOL!

I used to love FL when I moved to East TN 10 years ago. Most locations have since closed and the ones left are far flung. I do still follow the ads but I'm sorry FL, you just cannot compete with the other grocery stores here, namely Kroger. I won't really complain about double coupons because I don't usually use that many that are less than $1 face value. But, I just wish your sales were more exciting!
early morning shopping is the best shopping get good deals an steals!!!!

Enjoy! http://www.chow.com/food-news/71519/valentine-s-day-all-star-recipes/
i want some Raspberry Oatmeal cookies, why dose kroger only have a couple of the archway cookies like 5 to 7 kinds? 
I grew up in Michigan and the date filled oatmeal cookies were always a special treat at my grandmother's house. I live in the Chicago area now and can't find them anywhere (but see other Archway varieties are sold). So sad. Any advice or leads on this childhood favorite? Thanks, friends!
I am in Ohio and I am looking for the Soft Sugar Drop Cookie does anybody know were to find it?
I remember your rectangular, iced molasses Aunt Sally Cookie, soooo good! Many years ago the recipe was in the St. Paul, MN newspaper. I have made them many times. A very special treat!
an interesting and heartwarming story about this company, which is now owned by Lance snack people. The original Archway went belly up last year sometime shortly before Christmas last year and laid all employees off. Lance stepped in, rehired almost all of the employees and even gave the Xmas bonuses. After reading that in the paper I vowed to continue to buy their products in the future. They are good eating anyway, but a company like that I will support. 
Shortbread cookies rock.
I purchased some of your Windmill cookies last night. They are as delicious as ever. Any possibility you might change the ingredients to use unbleached flour and non-hydrogenated oil?
Archway Cookies teamed up with Operation Write home to send our troops 8,912 Valentines and over 4,000 cookies! The troops were able to fill out the Valentines Day cards in time to send home for the holiday today! While filling out the Valentines they enjoyed a variety of Archway Cookies. To find out more about this effort, check out OWHs blog: http://www.owhhomefrontblog.org/2011/02/happy-valentines-day.html. Thank you to our troops and Happy Valentines Day!
Archway used to make a fat free Dutch Cocoa cookie. They were the best cookie to eat while trying to watch your figure. Why dont you make them anymore??? I miss those cookies !
I love the frosty lemon & the iced molasses ! They are my favorites!!
My husband just ate the last Wedding Cake cookie. It's going to be a looooong time before the next one!!!!
Why can't I find Archway ginger Snaps in Syracuse, NY anymore
I'm in total withdrawl from Fruit n Nut Bars....I miss them soooo much, have tried to find recipes to make myself, with no luck....would love to be able to get them again!!
Are you having trouble locating Archway Cookies? You can order our everyday cookies over the phone to be delivered right to your door! Call 1-877-309-6361 to order!

I SO miss the one that was in Pungo! After we moved away from Virginia Beach (to Central Virginia), we used to travel three hours just to eat there! It had such an atmosphere. I hate to say it, but the others (Laskin Road and Williamsburg) just don't compare. Will we ever get one in Raleigh? 
Heading your way.... don't think I have tried Capt George's before, but I am looking forward to my stay in Hampton and having a great buffet meal......
Valentines is for seafood lovers!

wondering how many people who like the remake also love the originals...... I loved the way Richard Hatch (Apollo in Originals) came to return in the remake.
on this picture is a Mark 1 Viper Modelkit, which I have for more then a decade now. Colourscheme is diffirent cause I couldn't find the correct white Paint, so instead of white I used grey
Just a quick project! ;)
I just finished watching the entire series on Netflix... Absolutely Loved it. The ending was sad :(!
The series ending was disappointing,they should have just settled on the first devastated earth and stayed focused on that particular storyline (earth,humans,lives of the human/final five) I am sure that it is something they will keep in the bank just in case The Blood and Chrome doesn't make the ratings. From what had read it will be more gritty and true to BSG. Hoping for less Calvin Klein/soft core porn (assumption of what Caprica would be?).
Watched this series 3 times straight through now. Just got it in HD and makes it very surreal. Best series ever created! 
7 of 9 vs number 6 in a cat fight! Who wins?
just finished, what a visually captivating series. the series finale was emotionally satisfying.
wowww, testing the beta vrsion of the online game. simply amazing, is like be there, with your viper and with the fleet! the best ever online game!
Just finished it, I watched the first 2 years on TV but the last two on DVD. My son and I both thought it was a great ending!
just finished season one. I know im late to the party, but this show is frakin' awesome!
heart the original -- this will be my next netflix romance after I'm done with SGU
Edward James Olmos as Bill Adama is damn awesome!!
I just noticed that a post I put on the SyFy page has been removed and I can't make further comments. I didn't use any profanity. No heated words at all. Someone else stated that it was irritating that every post on the SyFy page was about Caprica or SGU. I pointed out that SyFy stepped in it when they canceled the sho...ws and that the SyFy page was the place for fans to vent. I said I 'm sorry you're not a fan. I finished by saying "best wishes". What gives? Anyone else have such a problem?
Just set my ringtone to All Along the Watchtower, and am planning on pretending I'm the only one who can hear it next time someone calls. I love Battlestar Galactica!
Dr Baltar was just at my place.... Just sayin'
This is the best show ever! Some vodka may be giving me a slight bias!
ffin brilliant , nice use of Richard hatch (Appollo) from original 78 series as well .
just watched the final episode, loved it. Lesson learned: don't let robots drink alcohol! ;)
Just finished the entire show a few days ago, undeniably amazing. The script, the acting, the psychology, realistic to the end! Ahhh it ended too quickly D':
GREAT show, love it!! Just started Season 4 and already sad that the end is in sight. 
love it all, except one thing...the stupidist mistake ever made. Sacrificing a newer better equiped, more advanced, larger Battlestar Pegasus and its many advantages such as an onboard viper production line for a 50 year old bucket (as great as it is) is a very VERY bad decision from any military or tactical position. They could have made that one major flaw in a better way. On the other hand it did good for a drematic and engaging episode. Love everything else though and hope Blood and Crome does well (dont trust syfy to keep it going though)
Cool show,Just finished season one, on to season two.....
Gaius is pissing me off already and I'm only into episode 1 of season 1. Surely he doesn't become any worse? But I'll love every minute of it. Fantastic series! 
Jez how come there is all these spaceships and stuff on my wrestling channel???
I just screamed and shouted, cursed and nearly leapt out of my chair when Adama in the Gallactica jumped into the atmosphere of New Caprica, dropped the viper squad, & jumped out just before impact! Great fraking CGI in this episode! 
I really, really want a first person shooter developed that would let me play through "The Oath" and "Blood on the Scales". Please?
Battlestar Galactica is like a good book that keeps you on the edge of your seat with every new page...you cant wait to see the next episode and to find out what happens next...At first I refused even watching one minute of this show when it was airing on scifi...good thing I gave it a chance 2 weeks ago on Netflix and I just now finished it...Lets just say that it is a complete masterpiece and in my opinion it is better then 99% of the movies that nowadays come out in the movie theatre...So say we all!!!
POSITIVELY THE GREATEST SHOW EVER CONCEIVED! I JUST GOT FINISHED WATCHING THE SERIES AND I AM DUMBFOUNDED! I WANT MORE! 
Battlestar Galactica Online launches today on SyfyGames.com!! To celebrate were giving away three BSG Last Supper posters and Big Frakkin Bags. Tell us your favorite BSG character in the comments and you could be randomly selected to win.
i`m just at 8 caps from the end of the best show ever! :D so say we all!
netflix has def. given this show a second life, never watched it on scifi during its original run but now i'm hooked. 
Can you buy the models they used to plan attacks in the same scale?
Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii
I liked Syfy back when it was Sci-Fi. Now they're just a horrible station canceling quality Sci-Fi shows like Caprica and showing crappy reality shows like Face Off and Ghost Hunters as well as wrestling. Their FB site is even blocking those questioning their program model.
Admiral Cain! She was such an dynamic re-imagining of the original character. Ohh, and she ate toasters for breakfast and was a tough as nails wartime leader.
Helo. So loving and true to himself and his ethics. How many people would deny their feelings when there stand so many people against it.
It's really hard to pick a favorite character on Battlestar - they're all so complex and entertaining! But there's just something about Saul Tigh that I adore. I love how he laughs when he's drunk! lol.
My favorite is "Fat" Lee Adama to see him let it all go just after a year of orbit of New Caprica. He lost all his confidence and cockiness. It was awesome when Admiral Adama said, "Get your fat ass out of here!" haha
I like Dr. Gaius Baltar, because he behave bad, but also good, he is not just good or bad. He is prehaps the person that is most like everyone in that way. And he also have a unike way to always think of how he can survive.
Starbuck Her character is just soo deep, and complex. she is just an awesome character.
Gotta be Big Daddy Adama. No matter what life threw at him he just kept going. Tough as old boot nails & a constant source of strength & inspiration to his crew. Who else could have led the survivors of the 12 colonies to a new home & with the help of the Cylons no less?
Boomer! She had that human/cylon inner conflict before anyone else, even before knowing she was one of them. It was thrilling to watch :)
Laura Roslin! She is hands-down the most compelling character, awesomely scary at times, but a driven leader. Haters gonna hate.
Boomer! It was great how faithful she was all the way to the end but you just weren't sure if she might just turn.
I liked Dr. Cottle. Tough old coot. Didn't mince word. Says it like it is.
Commander Adama is my favorite, but everyone on the show helped me through some horrific times. I was not adjusting well to my husband's death. My daughter brought the mini series and season one home for one of her visits to get my mind on other things. After the mini series was over I asked her if she had more of the series to watch, and fortunately she did. I know that this sounds silly, but watching Battlestar helped me to heal. When I was feeling really depressed, I'd watch another episode or two and lose myself in another world. Of course, the show didn't take away the pain of losing my best friend/husband, but for a while I was fighting Cylons and flying Vipers. Thanks everyone.
Bill Adama ... Frakk'n inspiring commanding officer, loyal, smart, steadfast. Then kinda guy you want to serve with. Also able to call BS on himself and get out of his own way to make the right decision. Wanna be like him when I grow up *LOL*
Ellen Tigh... drunk and singing "Bill Adama doesn't know where Earth is!" lol she cracks me up!
OMG, this is hard. Lee Adama just because Jamie Bamber is HOT, but depth of character, I gotta go with Gaius Balter. :)
Too many brilliant characters to pick just one favourite, but today it'[ll have to be - GAIUS FRAKKING BALTAR
Kara Thrace all the way. Katee Sackhoff did a great job portraying her. Although Lee Adama and Sam Anders are pretty easy on the eyes. ;)
Gajus Balter! Psycho, genius, chosen by a hot blond: toaster;)
Gaius Baltar - An underdog genius??? Brilliant! (and hot!)
Galen Tyrol 
I like the original Battlestar Galactica. I was upset when they changed, Col. Tigh, Starbuck and Boomer. Also when they took the nickname of Apollo from Capt. Adama (The son) and he does not have a child, adopted or otherwise named Boxie. What's up with that?
I'm surprised no one said Helo! Karl Agathon was the epitome of the loyal protector. he never directly betrayed an order from Adama, and he had an amazingly big heart. I know the contest is over, but my vote's for Helo!
Is it just me, or "D'Anna" is actually spelled "Diana", as the old Roman goddess of hunting?
I adore this series just half way through season 3 again u just find out more & plus the hints for the final 5 love it! 
Do I have to join this group, or can I just visit?
I hate Tigh. He was WRONG in everything he did and said and he was just the worst. I couldn't watch the show without yelling WORST at him every time I saw him...Did anyone else hate Tigh?
Starbuck's notes on the Cylon Raider are a mess! She said the engine power-up sequence began... "By squeezing something that looks like a red ligament with blue veins on the right side... coming out of a sack of gooey fluid... shaped like a cock". 
Have you tried the new Battlestar Galactica Online on SyfyGames.com yet? To celebrate its launch were giving away fun BSG stuff all week and today its a BSG guide book & Big Frakkin Bag. The book is full of behind-the-scenes revelations, interviews and more. Tell us your favorite BSG quote in the comments and you could be randomly selected to win! Dont forget to play at http://bit.ly/hroduz!
The only good thing about being at home sick is that you can watch all the great episodes again and again...I'm glad that I have ALL the shows. Being sick sucks SO SAY WE ALL. Which episode was your favorite? I still love the Adama Move(jumping into New Caprica) and the great fight and destruction of Pegasus
Butterfingers!
Does anyone know if the DVD/Blu Ray Box sets have all the un-aired/extended episodes or just the episodes that actually aired?
All episodes are available in HD on Netflix via streaming video. I just finished watching all four years of the series. What a ride!
Jamie Bamber had er recent short-lived role in Outcasts. A sort of joint BBC international SGU rip of.
This is something I have been thinking about: Cylons don't seem to age, and when they get resurrected, appear the same as when they died. So, why was Tigh younger when he met Adama? I'm going to assume I'm looking too deep into the mythology because there is no good explanation for that
This week we are giving away BSG prizes to celebrate the launch of Battlestar Galactica Online on SyfyGames.com. Today's winner will get three BSG figurines and a Big Frakkin Bag! Tell us what BSG character you would want to be trapped in space with in the comments section and you could be randomly selected to win!
Does anyone know if any stores are selling BSG figurines currently?
Heard that there is gonna be a new series set in the first Cylon conflict with early Adama, called Blood and Steel. Any truth in this?
Per il 1978 la serie originale stata superlativa, ma quella attuale spacca il c**o ai passeri!
I recommend you play Battlestar galactica Online, it's amazing ! You can choose cylon or colonial fleet. You take your character and, he is integrated to history of game.
Looks like our page has now been banned from speaking on SyFy's wall. But take a look at their response on my page. Apparently they don't know what trolling is...
Why didn't I watch BSG when it was on Television?! Just watched Crossroads part 2, blown away!
Last week Battlestar Galactica Online launched on SyfyGames.com and to celebrate were giving away two BSG Last Supper posters and Big Frakkin Bags. Tell us which BSG character you would like to have a spin off show in the comments section and you could be randomly selected to win.
starbuck from beginning
I think telling the story of the final five from the beginning would be cool.
I'd love to see a Tyrol "Chief" Galen spinoff, myself!
first Cylon war with Adama against the Cylons, and he needs a strong female female wingman like Starbuck to compete against for most kills per outing ... I think you could make a case for the beginning of the Scarface cylon vessel here.
hmm, maybe a Tom Zarek show? lots of opportunities for political hijinx...
I vote for seeing what happened to the red stripe Cylons after they were set free, where did they go, did they also pursue some sort of evolution?
I'd like to see the story of the last Cylons in the universe after Season 4 ! Can Cylons see angels ? If it is, they will see Baltar and Six... What is god's plan for them ? Are they really the last cylon in the universe (there was many cylon on original colonies, they where not destroyed, did they abandoned the place and all move to new caprica ?) ? Did they will protect new earth ?
I like Sharon "Boomer" Valerii ... 
well, we saw what happened with 'Caprica', didn't we? The story could have been tighter - not taken so long to build up the action, but it was really getting good. Unfortunately, there is no longer a science fiction channel on the air. All we have is the 'imagine greater' ghost wrestling channel.
Can I just buy one of those poster???? They are rather awesome!

I love that the Ancient Aliens series seen on the History Channel have actually entertained the BSG concept that early humans may have been influenced by or may have been themselves refugees from a dying space faring humanoid race. If such a thing could be proved to be true like envisioned on BSG imagine what an impact on earth's history, myths, and religious beliefs! You could probably make one awesome miniseries out of earth's alien history.
sooooo sad, just watched final episode last night. BSG ..come back!!!!
The first Cylon battle was broadcast today on Jeopardy! Watson, built by IBM, creamed the humans. It's all downhill from here. We're fracked
Bit late for ideas now, but can i just say.... What about a show called Gaius and Caprica - evolution through time. Showing them on "Earth" 100 million years later after Hera and the others found a place to live. Will it all repeat its self? Will the centurions come back to what? Give technology to the humans or repeat history. It could flash to the past as well and show how Hera lived as an older human/cylon. It could all some how be linked. 
Actually.... I'd like to see the story of Kobol and the original 13 tribes of man. How the war on kobol went down, the exodus of the 12 tribes and how they found the 12 worlds... There is little known about the colonial solar system. 
I'm just about to finish the last part of season 4 and I'm so bummed. I don't want it to be over but I'm compelled of course to find out how it ends. What am I going to watch when this is over? Caprica? Nothing will ever be quite as awesome.
I think i just saw president rosely on the train today. Oh wait she is not that fat
At the end of the final ep Baltar and Six should have mused over the fate of the Terran population now that, after 150,000 years, the two races had merged into one while sipping lattes in a Starbucks with Kara Thrace as manager. Since coffee is the only think Starbuck never drank I thought it would be a nice nod. The Cylons were addicted to caffeine for some reason.
just started season 1 on netflix. OMG why didnt i watch it when it was new? the storie is excellent!
Just started season 4. Kinda sad that its the last season... I almost wanted to put myself out of an airlock after i found out who the four other cylons were!!!
eee i've just watched the finale of the 2nd series! can't wait for the 3rd!
Someone realise that in the last episode of the first season, when Starbuck shoot at the glass that cover Apollo's Arrow, apear a cinegrafist behind the glass box ? 
Does Edward James Olmos have anything to do with Blood and Chrome? His direction in The Plan was fan-fraking-tastic I wan't sure if he'd be behind the camera at all in the new miniseries.
Brother Cavil/Number One is definitely my favorite Cylon.
Jus Started Watchin Lovin This Show!!! Cept Watchin It When Im High Makes All The Corniness Show, Hahaha
Edward James Olmos is 64 today! Happy birthday to the old man
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA IS THE BEST GAME I EVER SEEN AFTER DARKORBIT
Comicpalooza is excited to announce that Edward James Olmos will be appearing at the Comicpalooza Convention! Perhaps best known recently for his role on Battlestar Galactica, for more than 30 years, pioneering actor, filmmaker and activist Edward James Olmos has been creating memorable characters in projects that have burned themselves into our imagination.
my 2nd time through watching all of battlestar. I'm just on the scene where they jump after the battle at the cylon colony. Not sure I want to see the end again though :( 
My family just starting watching on Netflix. We are on season 2.5. We love it so far.
Without a doubt the best sci-fi series ever made. The strange thing is that the original, except for the special effects, was so dorky. I am not sure about anyone else, did the last time the Galactica come out of FTL actually hurt. I felt for the old girl!
I just bought season one and never seen the show...all i can say is WOW!! never been this into a show in a long time...cant wait to see the rest. I know i'm behind on everything but i'm going to do my best to catch up. 
watched 'The Plan' last night after having re-watched all the 4 seasons. It's over now :( Back to reality. Was surprised how good 'The Plan' was, although I was expecting it to cover the whole 4 seasons, not just the first 2. What next??? 
Just at two caps from the end of the best tv show ever! so say we all!

TIP - Buy chicken breasts in value packs - place each breast in a fold top sandwich bag or plastic wrap. Weight it. Write the weight on the bag in Sharpie marker (or use a label if you prefer). Pack all the breasts into a ziploc freezer bag. You can easily see the weight through the bag, it's amazing how much each can vary!

Plums or Pear (Ube)... It is native to the west coast of Africa, between Eastern Nigeria and Angola, and goes by the botanical name of Dacryodes edulis. Everyone knows that it is boiled or roasted and goes very well with fresh roasted or boiled corn. It presents a different more complex flavor when it allowed to ripen and become soft, and can be eaten at that time without cooking
Coconut Sweet meat, nutty richness and a pleasant chew are just a few of the reasons we love coconuts. One of the few ingredients that's equally at home in appetizers, main courses and desserts, the coconut is an indispensable ingredient in African cuisines.
Hmm! I'm salivating,looks nourishing.
Any african dish or fruit 4 weightloss?
Try nsala soup made wit chicken and pd/yam or banga soup and stach!

Fisnished off our honeymoon with you. Couldn't have picked a better hotel :) 
Is Sugar and Ice still at the Wynn? I didn't see it on the list of restaurants. Love that little gem!
I just had an amazing experience with Wynn/Encore rep - Edward Ch. Not only he fixed a minor mistake with dates of my COMPLEMENTARY reservation, but also fixed it with adding more of a food credits. Compare to other hotels in Vegas these days, -and you will be amazed that excellent customer service not only still exists, but actually thrives in Vegas - in the best spot there is! Thank you, Edward, thank you Wynn/Encore, thank you Steve Wynn, who knows how to do business even in bad economy. " There is overwhelming evidence that the higher the level of self-esteem, the more likely one will be to treat others with respect, kindness, and generosity. Nathaniel Branden
Is there another Oscar party planned this year in the sportsbook? Last year was a blast!
I stayed at Encore a couple weeks ago and was really annoyed with $20 resort fee that was charged for services I didn't need/use in my less than 24 hour stay. I asked the front desk clerk at check about getting it waived and she was unwiling to do anything. When I asked to speak to a manager, she came back after 5 minutes and said the manager was on the phone and she didn't want to wait. I tried contacting the manager and pretty much got a blow off in email in return. Has anyone else experienced such poor customer service and/or been successful in getting the fee waived?
Valentine's in Vegas? See who made "The List" -- http://bit.ly/i8dpoX
I am looking for information on planning a bachelor party and we are considering Wynn as one of the options for rooming/gambling/etc. Can you tell me if you have a person that deals with this type of reservation? I would want a suite, 3-5 rooms, cabana, private poker table, dinner reservations, VIP club access, etc and don't want to have to make these arrangements independent of one another. Any thoughts on how you can help? 
 anyone know when the Fall 2011 dates are announced and when they go on sale? That is going to be my 40th B-day present - just excited to pinpoint a date :
Hi, is there somebody I can chat to via email about my trip in September? I work on a remote minesite in Australia and have internet access, but work wont let me call over-seas on the satellite phone. I just want to enquire about some packages for Kaskade Sunday at Encore Beach Club. Thanks!
I think Wynn has THE BEST coffee!!!! I asked about it and was told that it is "Boyd's" brand, however, Boyd's has many varieties. Can you tell me which variety it is, I would like to order some. THANKS!!
Hi im coming to stay with you around March time iv heard rumours about a $100 fee charge per day for damages is this true as i dont fancy any unexpected surprises when i arrive :) thanks
Hello!, Im planning to stay at Wynn-Encore this year in September, when are you planning to close the golf course, two years ago around those dates it was close :-( Thank you!
Just spent the last foour days at the Wynn. It was a wonderful experience. We will be returning next year... Maybe later spring when it's a little warmer. Thank you for making our much needed Holiday wonderful.
Great feature on one of our best Pastry Chefs!
We're definitely indulging in this!

Suntrust,You are quite possibly the worst bank I have ever been with.I have been a loyal customer for many years and yet you continue to find every way possible to take my last dime.This morning for instance I was pretty impressed with how you WAITED to post things to my checking account until you were sure you could get the MOST in overdraft fees.You actually had some things posted as paid yesterday that are now posted as an overdraft.Real nice how you can use some creative manipulation to drain every last dollar out of my accounts.I just LOVE how you bounce all the small charges while paying off the larger check.It sure works out to your favor doesn't it?And you know what? That check was scheduled to post on the first THROUGH YOUR BILL PAY SYSTEM.But you conveinently posted it yesterday so you could get your fees.This isn't the first time you've done it either. Just so you know I will be closing out all accounts with you today.I am done with your thieving scandalous ways.
How do you get someone to be helpful at Suntrust? I have a 30 year mortgage and can not get any answers from the mortgage group despite several attempts. My last attempt was to talk to a mortgage lender in a Macon, Ga branch. I explained that I wanted to take advantage of the lower rates that are now prevailing. She pulled up my account and started looking at it. After a quick cursory review, she told me I was an excellent customer but regardless of a good credit rating and longtime standing with the bank unfortunately due to the current environment there was nothing she could do. She stated that there would be no way to get a comp in middle ga for an appraisal on a Jumbo loan so there was no need to even try. Why would SunTrust not want to help an EXCELLENT customer????? In these times you woudl think banks would want to keep their customers that are doing the right thing instead of trying to run them off!
Christina and Lindsey at the Cartersville Main Street Branch are always so nice and willing to help. The individuals, all of them, in that branch remind me with their actions why I bank with SunTrust. 
Why does my debit card not work but yet i get texts updates saying i am fine?
Happy Valentines Day STB. I <3 you.
Pretty upset with you guys right now. I deposited $20 CASH on Friday and still hasn't shown up in my account. I called and talked to a representative and she rudely told me I have to wait until Tuesday. I never would have imagined that a CASH deposit would take over three days to process. Now I have to delay a check that I needed to write by today. I am really just disappointed.
*ALERT* We are aware of an issue impacting some SunTrust ATMs/Branches. Our technical team is actively working to resolve the issue and it is their highest priority. We're genuinely sorry for any inconvenience caused and will keep you updated.
*WEATHER ALERTS* Due to weather conditions in the Nashville, Memphis, and Eastern Tennessee area several branches/ATMs will have delayed openings. Branches in the Tennessee Valley Market will open at 10:00 AM and branches in Memphis and Nashville will open at 11:00 AM.

I just wanted to make a post because I was so excited to have some recipes featured in the Red River Family Magazine for their February Issue. Valentines Day Treats. Once you click on the link it is on page 19. http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1qv3e/February2011/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fredriverfamily.com%2F
Rolo Turtle Candies would be great for Valentines Day. Just replace the pecans with Valentine Colored M&M's. Walmart has the Square Pretzels on sale right now. Those are my favorite pretzels for these. http://www.mommyskitchen.net/2009/12/rolo-pretzel-turtles-easy-turtle.html

Really like your site hope it helps me teach my daughter to cook
Hi Tina. I am waiting for the sausage stars to cool down a bit and just wanted to drop you a line to say how thankful I am for your website and blogs. You share the same family values as we do and unfortunately I did not have the chance to learn much of cooking from my own mom before she passed, so I REALLY enjoy your recipes as they totally remind of me good old fashioned home cooking. I have added so many of your recipes to my own family recipe book :0)
Hi Tina!! A few days ago, I mixed up a Friendship bread stater and yesterday (Sunday) was day 5 when I was supposed to add more ingredients. I left home yesterday at 8:30am and didn't get home till 10:30pm and completely FORGOT to add the ingredients. What do I do now?!?! Can I still add them and then push everything back a day or should I start over?!!? Thank you for your site - it's my official "go to" site when I am looking to try something new. I LOVE IT!!! 
I love looking at your monthly menu, I just wish I could plan that far ahead ...I am about to try out your homemade vanilla pound cake recipe:)
Just made your Blueberry sour cream scone for a neighbor, and because they are so easy to make, and smell so good, I had to make a whole 'nother batch for the 5 kiddos at home! Keep the recipes comin'.
Carson and his wonderful teacher after his PTA performance last night. They did such a great job.
I played around with the Saltine Toffee Candy aka Cracker Candy Recipe. I made a second verions that is just as tasty as the original. The only difference is this version in non nuts and less chocolaty. I am so addiced to this candy. I took photos and updated the cracker candy post with both versions. http://www.mommyskitchen.net/2010/12/saltine-toffee-candy-aka-christmas.html
What are your thoughts on freezing the filling of your chicken pot pie recipe? I made it for dinner last night, then it occurred to me that if I made extra filling maybe I could freeze it and serve over biscuits sometime for an easy meal. But I was concerned about the milk in it changing the texture?
Thanks to you, tonight I have successfully made buttermilk biscuits that actually turned out INCREDIBLE! THANK YOU THANK YOU!
Tina, Can you double the pudding ingredients to make more pudding? Will you have to use a larger pan than the 8x8 if you did? I LOVE CHOCOLATE!!! I have had this in a couple of restaurants, and it was heavenly! ANYTHING CHOCOLATE!!!
I made your chicken planks for lunch today. They were fabulous!!!!!!!
I made the crock pot salisbury steak recipie the other night, and it was DELCIOUS! My son is apprensive about me trying new things (I've gotten a bad reputation) and he told me they tasted like I didn't cook them. That was such a compliment! I'm going to try your "city chicken" tonight. I'm a southern girl born and raised, thanks for the wonderful site!
Today I made your Strawberry Cake Balls and Peanut Butter Hearts. Such hard work but after sore feet and an aching back they turned out AWESOME! Everyone loved them. I packaged them up and put some Gooseberry tags on them. So cute! Thanks so much for all your great recipes! You are becoming my second favorite (first being Gooseberry Patch) &hearts;
&hearts; Happy Valentines Day Everyone &hearts; I hope you have a wonderful day with all of your sweeties! Going to the kiddos Valentine Parties today it will be so much fun.

All is well again in the Butler House.
Hi Tina, I making your spaghetti and meatballs recipe but I am making the crock pot version. Do I still need to bake the meatballs before adding them to the crock pot or can I just roll them and throw them in the last 2-3 hours of cooking?
Change of plans for dinner. Suppose to have Beer in the Rear Chicken, but stayed at a friends too long so BLT & Checkers Famous Fries instead. Going to redeem myself with dessert ~ Apple Cobbler~

Wow. Email support is the WORST!
Just had some amazing chicken on wads. yum!
Yes, please me the food NOW!!! I acme to eat then watch the game YEAH!!! GO BOSTON MARKET!!!
Been a "Boston Market" fan for many years. They keep closing the ones close to our house and we keep driving farther almost every Saturday night. Not crazy about the new green beans. However, have to love our friends in Buffalo Grove, IL. We walk in and they ask us if we want the plain green beans. Made to order! Have to love the personal service! Thanks! Your staff is wonderful! 
I just had the frozen Beef and Noodles dinner and I've got one thing to say: "Boston Market, what were you thinking?' - There was nothing good about it.
hope they never stop making their sweet potato casserole it is so good i love it and i dont even like sweet potatos . it is so good,
Just found out that they closed the Grapevine location, now i have to go to either Southlake or Irving if i want Boston Market, this really sucks since i live in Euless!
omg your mac & cheese is to die for ....mmmm
Prices are too steep
VERY UNHAPPY with the service that I was provided. Not only did the manager heather in hurst, tx call me a liar to my face. She was very rude and I have never been treated with such disrespect. CUSTOMER SERVICE is important!! My friends and I will not return to this resteraunt as long as people like continue to work for this company. Shame on you. Is this really how you want your company represented. NOT GOOD!!
I love the new Green Beans!
I so DO NOT like the new Green Beans...PLEASE bring back the old ones!!!!!! :-(
Ohh La La went for lunch today the food was good as usual but my heart went thump thump as I thought about all the GREAT changes you've made to make yourself a cut above adverage. REAL SIVERWARE AND PLATES yeah it's the little things that make me slow down and savor the flavor of that hearty healthy food.Cuttin' down what goes into the landfill, Mother Earth Loves ya Thanks!!
My friend and I both like chicken carver sandwiches but I don't like cheese and she's very allergic to tomatoes. The market nearest our office cannot seem to get those orders right even when it shows on the ticket. I think part of the problem is language. We live and work in a very diverse community and like it that way. Seems to me that no matter what language the register uses, it should be possible for one screen in the prep area to be in Spanish or whatever the predominant second language is at any location. Might even only be a software fix. There should still be an English screen nearby for the managers and as a learning too, but I think better communication could mean a vast improvement in service.
Man it has been about at lease three weeks I've had the taste for those loaded mashed potatoes from boston market bout too get some now they are banging!!! 
Digging into a plate of chicken? What are your utensils of choice: fork and knife, or your hands?
Went to Boston Market with my mom and the chicken I think went on a diet and now they give you a big plate with the small sides in cups how cheap! 
Haven't been to boston market in ages , food was wonderful, fav side is a toss up between creamed spinach and the sweet potatoes, wasn't too geeked that the. "Meal" didn't include the drink????
I just got a job here! ;D
---You have the best chicken ceasar salads!

ENOGASTRONOMIA, ARGOMENTO CALDO. Il Rapporto Isnart/Unioncamere distribuito alla Bit ha dedicato all'argomento un intero capitolo. Si ad esempio scoperto che uno degli stereotipi per eccellenza dell'italianit, quale la pizza, si colloca solo all'8 posto nella graduatoria dei piatti che rappresentano la nostra trad...izione culinaria. Il primo posto appannaggio degli spaghetti, il secondo delle lasagne e il terzo della pasta secca, seguita dal risotto.
Il tema dell'educazione al vino delle nuove generazioni non sembra riscuotere un adeguato interesse. Forse perch gli adolescenti non hanno potere di acquisto sufficiente?

Black carbon is a greenhouse particle that is 680 times as heat-trapping as CO2, and it causes the ice sheets and glaciers around the world to melt even faster. Up to 40% of black carbon emissions come from burning forests for livestock. #Supreme Master Ching Hai www.crisis2peace.org
To stop the climate change and to stop the waste of the forests and land, stop talking around the subject. Talk to the point: Meat industry must stop. #Supreme Master Ching Hai www.crisis2peace.org
Livestock is the primary human-caused emitter of methane, and methane not only has 72 times the heat-trapping ability, it is a shorter-lived gas. This means that it will leave the atmosphere much faster than CO2, within just a decade as opposed to thousands of years for CO2. Therefore, eliminating methane by eliminating livestock breeding is the fastest way to cool the planet. #SMCH www.crisis2peace.org

I am so done with Kohls. I feel like I just wasted time. I left work early to return a Zeroe Exposure winter coat. I beleived the zero hassle no return receipt policy. I was even honest enough to tell two of the woman that I had bought it for 60 percent off. Apparently they couldn't trace the coat in there system. I was told that I could not exchange my coat for another unless I stood in line at the bank to trace down my receipt. I suppose the no hassle return policy is not no hassle. It is not my fault if the tag number could not be found in the system. They said they could not track down my purchase via my name either and would not even try. I am so done with my local store.
coupon code: FEBSAVINGS 30% off for Kohls Charge card holders 2/16 THRU 2/23/11. Just a heads up if u're planning on shopping.
Ok this is getting ridiculous... I just saved $233.20. I'm going to need Kohl's anonymous! I got SO much awesome stuff! 20% off and used my Kohl's cash on top of the already amazing prices. I think it's official, Kohl's is my favorite store!
When I get a 15% or 20% coupon, I tuck it in my purse "just in case" I need something. When I get a 30%......I go shopping!
To everyone who thinks Kohl's is an evil corporation who scams you out of your money: PLEASE. You have no idea how much Kohl's will bend over backwards to make their customers happy. If something is ringing up at a different price than you "thought", the cashiers will change the price. If something is cheaper in the last 2 weeks you bought it, bring in your receipt and they will do a price adjustment. They give you 20% off just for applying for the card, not being approved, and they will return almost ANYTHING! (even pee-soaked pants:true story) They sell books and stuffed animals for charity and have their employees go to charity events. A lot stores even have solar panels which cut down the energy bill by 30-40%. For God sakes they even give you 30% off coupons AND Kohl's cash. What store can honestly say they do all that? Yeah, that's what I thought.
I'm at that age where juniors' trends are too young, but some women's trends are too mature for me, so I mix it up -- a Candie's purse and headband add just enough to my everyday style. How do you keep your look fresh?
Just blocked ya'lls posts on my facebook page. I REALLY don't want pictures of girls in bikinis on my newsfeed. How about stopping that right now?
I haven't received a coupon in my email or in mail for a long time. Wish you would send more coupons. I shop there often, just spent $323 4 days ago with no coupons. Going back today, would like a coupon to use. It would be nice for the non credit card user.
explain this math to me - I have a 30% off coupon. I had $70 in Kohl's cash (which of course represents substantial prior purchases). I wanted to use my 30% coupon on today's purchases along with the Kohl's cash. But I learned that Kohl's cash is deducted from the subtotal of the purchase PRIOR to the use of the 30% coupon. After much explaining from the unhappy cashier, I was told that this is Kohl's policy and that's just the way it is. It seems to me that Kohl's cash should be deducted from the total owed, AFTER the 30% coupon has been applied. So I asked that my purchases today be cancelled and rerung, using only my 30% coupon, and keeping my Kohl's cash to use later. (which did not make my cashier any happier)
Hello Kphls! I love your store and if you gave out I "heart" Kohls shirts, i would wear it proudly. My only quam, along with every other department retailer, is the lack of selection and quantity of boys toddler and infants clothing. The ratio of girls to boys rack is always 3:1 or worse. Moms of boys love to shop too and the selection of designs and sizes is always lacking. Other moms out there "like" if you agree!

b'1. Transportation Secretary LaHood: \xe2\x80\x9cno electronic-based cause for unintended high-speed acceleration in Toyotas. Period.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n\nAfter a 10-month \xe2\x80\x9cexhaustive, thorough\xe2\x80\x9d study of Toyota\xe2\x80\x99s electronic throttle controls, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and NASA reported today they found no evidence that electronics were to blame for alleged unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles. \r\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo let me be clear: the jury is back. The verdict is in. There is no electronic-based cause for unintended high-speed acceleration in Toyotas. Period,\xe2\x80\x9d Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told a packed news conference in Washington, D.C. \r\n\nLaHood said NHTSA and NASA rigorously examined nine vehicles, poured over 280,000 lines of software codes and bombarded the vehicles with electro-magnetic radiation and found no flaws in Toyota\xe2\x80\x99s electronic systems. \r\n'

Looking for a good twice baked potato recipe? Any suggestions??
Last night for supper I concocted a casserole from ingredients on hand. It was VERY good. Pork Chop Casserole In a foil lined 10 x 15 casserole dish layer in order: 3 lbs sliced white potatoes 1/2 bell pepper sliced 1 med onion sliced 1 jar sliced mushrooms--drained 1 stick margarine sliced sprinkle with salt and pepper Place 9-10 (family pack) of boneless pork chops on top of vegetables. Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper. Whisk together: 1 can cream of mushroom soup 1 can cream of chicken soup 4 oz sour cream about 2 cups half and half (enough to make sauce thick but not soupy) Pour on top of pork chops/vegetables. Bake 75 minutes at 350 degrees. 
We have a morning talk show here in Middle TN and one of the hosts features a *surfsite* of the day......I just recommended yours. :)
Making chicken and gravy right now can't wait for it to be done! Thank You for all your wonderful recipes!
made the beefy pizza appetizer for supper...made them in individual sub buns because it was what I had on hand. Definately going to make it as an appetizer soon. It was something new for supper...I am always out of ideas. Thanks so much!
Looking for a special brownie recipe for Valentines Day. Lost my recipe. It's a dense brownie somewhere between a cake brownie and a fudge brownie with a ganche icing. Not very crumbly. Thanks!
 a few weeks ago, we were talking about the triple crockpot container, found one for $80.99 , each crock pot is 2.5 quart, you can buy it at BrylaneHome.com, and if you enter promo code for free shipping, it is BHSHADOW. 
i tell ya,,, i have been staring at recipes here all last week trying to figure out something to make for super bowl.....just too much good stuff. so i decided to make the black-eyed pea jambalaya.....had to have the chow chow and tabasco on the side////delicious Mary!
Just wanted to say I have the 3 Envelope Picante Roast, minus the Picante in the crock pot and my house smells heavenly!!!! I just tried a bite while waiting on the hubby to get home and it taste just as good!!!! I love your site!
Tried your recipe for Chicken and Dumpling bake on Monday night. My whole family loved it. In fact, my kids are begging me to make again for supper night !!!!
After seeing you mention the cookbook "Who's Your Mama, Are You Catholic. and Can you make a roux?" several times I just had to order it. I'm so glad I did! My daddy's family is from Churchpoint and it brought back wonderful memories for me. My husband has already earmarked a few of the dishes my momma use to make for me to try. Thanks for sharing this great cookbook with me.
Do you have a good recipe for Oysters Bienville?
Wanted to say that you have a really good site and many of your recipes are very similar to what I learned from my Mother...I have a few I don't see though so I'll hunt them up and share them..Thank You..You really seem like a very sweet person...
I just added this thru my phone. Read thru some of the recipes and SO can't wait to get home so I can print some of them off and begin to make them! Wow! 
This weather has been so nice down here this week though I do need to get out and work the yard, clean the beds up & rake a bit, ugh. :) Wishing you continued spring-like weather for a gorgeous weekend - have fun & enjoy it!
Morning! Isn't if funny how a little thing can bring back such vivid memories of a loved one? Was plating up some grits with my breakfast & had a flash image of my mama vigorously stirring butter & lots of pepper into a bowl of grits. She could have been standing right there. Sure brought a smile to my face!
Im cooking your 'sunday supper' roast this evening......got my rice on right now. Just about ready. This has been smelling up my house all day and I CANNOT wait to EAT!
Got any good ground beef recipes???? Help!!!!
Does anyone have the started recipe for the friendship bread?? I am thinking it has yeast in it?? I have the instructions for the 10 days.
Donna is looking for a starter recipe for Friendship Bread. I have one somewhere around here, but haven't made that recipe in so long I have no idea where it is. Does anybody have their recipe handy?
Leftover butter beans & cornbread for lunch, shrimp something (I don't know yet) for supper later, root beer glazed chicken on the grill Sat. likely & Sunday lasagna! What are y'all cookin' up this weekend?
i love ur recipes!! i cant find a recipe for fried corn with out alot of milk this lady from made it with onions a flour fried in it has anyone heard of this
The Cajun & I ended up going to the d'Iberville BBQ Throwdown/Festival today & ate way more BBQ than any two humans should ingest in one day! Sure was good though & has me really considering moving into a smoker. Picked up a Sweet Stuff king cake from Fayards on the way home. Fat & happy (and REALLY sleepy now LOL)!!
Mary, I have the recipe for Friendship Cake posted on my blog. 
Looking for a good Cabbage roll recipe..I could not find one in your site..Thank you:)
Shirley is looking for our best cabbage rolls recipes. Mine is pretty basic but hasn't made it to the site yet since The Cajun isn't a fan of cabbage. He'll eat the filling, but not the cabbage leaves! Do you have a tried and true family favorite to share with us?
In my experience, I don't think Cajuns in general are particularly fond of cabbage except maybe stewed. My mother suffered through every New Year's Day dinner at my aunt's house in Ohio due to the pork and sauerkraut. She tried to make herself like cabbage rolls but couldn't quite get there. But when I was growing up in the 70s, I learned to love sauerkraut, pork and mashed potatoes from the school cafeteria. I can't imagine schools serving anything like that today!
I'm looking for ideas for a southern wedding reception ... finger foods, etc. I would like to find something special to make it different than your average cake, peanuts and mints. Thank you.
trying to figure out what to make tonight for dinner with crawfish tails. I do not want to run to the store and have no tomatoe sauce or paste!! ugh help 
I'm looking for a recipe for a true southern caramel cake. The one I use now is what people used to call a burnt sugar cake where you caramelize the sugar and use it in the cake and frosting. I would like to find one someone has had success with that is yellow cake with the caramel frosting. I'm thinking the frosting was made with evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk. Could anyone help me out?
Two things I learned today. People actually fry spaghetti! Anybody ever make this? AND, the ole retro remake of retired Taco Flavored Doritos were brought back last December (and I didn't know!) but they are keeping them around longer than they planned! I think I used to live on those when I was a teenager. Have a great evening y'all!!

And last of the bread, but certainly not least, this one is on my Super Bowl Menu! Your guests will love love love this one. Just slice and serve this Sausage Cheese Bread. http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2010/10/sausage-and-cheese-bread.html
This tasty Pork Chop & Onion Bake is another easy weeknight meal that can hit the table pretty quick. http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2010/01/easy-pork-chop-and-onion-bake.html
Use those same pistolette rolls & this stuffed crab recipe to form patties and make mini crabmeat po'boys. Add extra filler to stretch your crabmeat out, bake or pan fry. Top with cheese. Lay out on a tray, cover tightly with foil and warm in the oven or use the microwave to melt the cheese. http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/06/stuffed-crab.html 
When we were working through sandwiches from the Super Bowl link page yesterday, I forgot to mention these Homemade Sliders. Many of you know about these and have made them, but for those of you who are new, they are easy, delicious, and everybody loves them! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2010/05/homemade-beef-sliders.html
I can't believe that February is half over already! Why is it when you are young, the days seem to drag on forever, but once you hit "a certain age" time seems to fly?? Anybody doing any special cooking for Valentine's Day? I'm hoping to cook up a reservation myself. :)
Pretzel S'mores decorated for Valentine's Day! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2011/02/recipe-for-pretzel-smores.html
Gumbo is another great choice for Super Bowl because it makes a big pot that can be held on the stove. Seafood gumbo is pretty expensive to make, but you can put on a pot of chicken & sausage gumbo pretty cheap. Andouille is spicy, so switch to regular smoked sausage & add just a bit of Cajun seasoning to keep it on the milder side for your guests: http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2008/12/chicken-andouille-gumbo.html
One of the best things about jambalaya is that it feeds a crowd, so it's perfect for Super Bowl. I have a roasted meat Cajun style jambalaya and a Creole version made with tomatoes & shrimp - each a little different from the other. I also prefer to cook mine in a Dutch oven in the the oven, rather than on the stovetop. http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2008/10/jambalaya-with-chicken-smoked-sausage.html

Made these wings for Super Bowl & we really enjoyed them! Would be a great addition to your party wing collection. Cane Syrup Glazed Sriracha Hot Wings: http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2011/02/cane-syrup-glazed-sriracha-hot-wings.html
One of my favorite ways to eat chicken is Southern Stewed Chicken. It may not take a pretty picture, but it sure is good! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/02/stewed-chicken.html
Don't know about your part of the world, but it is GORGEOUS here on the Mississippi Gulf Coast!! Nice break from the cold that's for sure. I do have one more soup to share with y'all though and it's a winner! Chicken Dumplin' Soup - yum - enjoy! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2011/02/chicken-dumplin-soup.html
I used a round boule loaf for this Beefy Pizza Bread since that's what I had on hand, but of course French bread works fantastic. Just slice into serving pieces & watch them disappear! Love this one too. http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/01/beefy-pizza-bread.html
Last one before lunch ... this is one of my favorite sandwiches and it would work well on pistolettes for Super Bowl too! The flavor of this loose meat sandwich is fantastic! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/02/yummy-hamburger-sandwich.html Stay tuned for some great appetizer breads this afternoon! 
New post & perfect for Super Bowl! 3 Envelope Crockpot Roast Beef Sliders with Caramelized Onion: http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2011/02/recipe-for-3-envelope-crockpot-roast.html

Just plug in the search terms and it'll bring up a Google search of my site. http://www.deepsouthdish.com Question? Email me at mary@deepsouthdish.com anytime! Most days I check email several times. Have a good one!
I'm thinking I need to dust off the grill this weekend. Maybe make these Root Beer Glazed Chicken Legs? http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2010/07/root-beer-glazed-drumsticks.html Course there is a BBQ festival going on in d'Iberville on Saturday too... hmmm...
If you don't like the namesake of this dessert, just called it a layered peanut butter dessert! Like the other layered desserts, it has a press in crust, a layer of chocolate pudding, cream cheese and whipped cream, but this one has peanut butter. It's is SO good y'all & great for feeding a crowd. http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2008/11/jimmy-carter-cake-pudding-dessert.html
Just a reminder that all of the recipes that you've seen featured this week on the FB page are located at one "Super Bowl Page" on the website.

Grab a couple of good, dense loafs of 10 to 12-inch round Italian bread from your local deli and build a couple of Muffulettas for your Super Bowl party. Cut into small wedges and platter. Or, go light on the olive salad and you can build these on pistolettes too! Put those little sous chefs (aka kids) to work to help you build them. http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/01/mississippi-new-orleans-muffuletta.html
There's always good old Texas Sheet Cake. This recipe has been around forever, is so easy to make, and since it's made in a thin layer on a big jellyroll pan, it feeds a crowd. Not to mention it's just delicious!! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/05/tommie-to-die-for-buttermilk-chocolate.html
Afternoon y'all! Italian sausage can make a quick, easy & tasty weeknight meal & I love to pair it up with big pasta & a tomato cream sauce. What's your favorite way to cook them? http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2008/11/sausage-with-rigatoni-in-tomato-cream.html
7 Can Taco Soup. A favorite cold weather food - satisfying, filling & EASY! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2010/03/7-can-taco-soup.html
Course, good old familiar banana pudding with a homemade custard & meringue topping is always a winner anytime! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/07/homemade-southern-banana-pudding.html
What does being neighborly mean to you? Jackie over at Syrup and Biscuits has a great post about it that also includes her 30 year old Friendship Bread recipe. No pictures yet, as she just got her starter going, but stay tuned! http://bit.ly/fk3WyW
Southern BBQ Pork Brunswick Stew: http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2011/02/southern-bbq-pork-brunswick-stew-recipe.html
An email from a reader and this spring-like weather had me longing for a fruited iced tea. Can't tell you how many pitchers I have made of this the past couple weeks, but it is so refreshing. The cherry juice was an add-in, but is completely optional. http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2011/02/southern-fruit-iced-tea-recipe.html Try it sometime!!
Chili is a great & inexpensive choice to feed a crowd on Super Bowl Day too. If you don't already have a favorite recipe, this one is delicious! It's a no bean chili, but feel free to add them or check out my other chili recipes linked at the bottom. Don't forget the add-ons & grab a bag of corn chips or French fries to make Chili Cheese Fries! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/02/stovetop-no-bean-beef-chili.html
Another good Super Bowl dessert to make are Homemade Brownies! There are a couple of unique steps you have to do with mixing these, but it is so worth it. Just the right amount of chocolate, just the right sweetness, just the right kind of tender and moist, and nearly gooey insides, with a so slightly crunchy top crust. http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2010/05/homemade-chocolate-brownies.html
Y'all know I'm a dip lovin' gal and this one is one of my most favorites! Perfect for game day - Awesome Jalapeno Popper Dip: http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2010/02/deep-south-dish-awesome-jalapeno-popper.html
Last dessert & perfect for Super Bowl! I used fresh tangerines for this cake, but just substitute canned mandarin oranges to make it easier! It's basically a cross between a Mandarin Orange Cake & Paula Deen's Is it Better Than Sex Cake and it is delicious! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/11/fresh-citrus-not-better-than-sex-cake.html
Southern Vegetable Beef Soup is a good one too for this cold weather. And... it always reminds me of my grandma when I make it. :) http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2008/11/mary-southern-vegetable-beef-soup.html
Melanie said "My husband is 100% German and he LOVED this." Okay, it's not traditional southern fare, but if you're looking for something different to do with boneless pork chops, give this a try. Works great with boneless, skinless chicken breasts & strips also! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/01/pork-schnitzel.html 
I was poking around in my Trisha Yearwood Home Cooking cookbook again, and ran across this recipe for her Charleston Cheese Dip. Man, is it good! Another one for the dip collection. http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2011/02/charleston-cheese-dip-adapted-from.html
Mini sandwiches and sliders are a great choice for Super Bowl. Stick a pork butt or shoulder, a beef roast, even a chicken in the crockpot. Shred it, pile it up on split dinner rolls & you'll feed a crowd! I'll be posting a few links today for things you can make into mini sandwiches. Hope that you will share any ideas you have too!
Here's another dip that everybody seems to love - great for game day. I like to use fresh cooked chicken rather than canned, but either will work. http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/09/buffalo-chicken-dip.html
That's it for me everybody. Hope you got some good ideas this week to help you have a fantastic Super Bowl party. Just heard Dallas had 8 inches of snow today - crazy! All this ice & snow - y'all stay safe & warm and have a great weekend. Food. Family. Memories!
We've been talking sandwiches - now let's talk about some bread with stuff on it! This rich & cheesy bread is buttery decadent enough to pass Super Bowl scrutiny - http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/06/cheesy-garlic-bread.html
Have you seen my "Cooking Tips" section right under the top of the website page header? You'll find tips there for all kinds of cooking helpers, including this one for "How to Make Perfect Pasta!" http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/01/how-to-make-perfect-pasta.html
Don't limit yourself to shredded meat though. Cook a slice-able roast, get some Pistolette (mini French) rolls and make mini roast beef po'boys! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2010/04/step-by-step-homemade-mississippi-roast.html
Another reason to look forward to spring - Vidalia onions! I sure have missed them this winter with these strong eyeball tearing yellow onions. While we wait, substitute another sweet onion or good ole yellow onions for these crispy onion strips: http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/09/deep-fried-sweet-vidalia-onion-strips.html
Chicken on sale this week? Try this recipe for Roasted Balsamic Chicken Thighs http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/10/roasted-balsamic-chicken-thighs.html
Updated! Meal in One Cajun Steak Casserole http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/06/country-bob-meal-in-one-cajun-steak.html
Made extra grits this morning, stirred in some cheese then poured into a loaf pan to make some of these! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/02/grits-cakes.html This fried cakes work nicely under those shrimp with the shrimp & grits recipe I posted a few days back too.

Okay, I got one more appetizer in. Bacon Wrapped Chicken Poppers! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2011/02/ultimate-jalapeno-chicken-poppers.html
Thawed out chicken breasts and shrimp today - thinking either chicken fried chicken or batter fried shrimp maybe? Better make up my mind soon - daylight's burnin'!! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2010/07/batter-fried-shrimp.html 
Creamy Butter Beans are on the menu today! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2008/11/southern-creamy-butter-beans-large-lima.html
Use this Crockpot BBQ Beef and dinner rolls to make mini sandwiches: http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/02/crockpot-barbecue-beef-for-sandwiches.html
Morning! Hope y'all had a great weekend. Sure was pretty here - though a bit humid, already. Gumbo is a regular around here since The Cajun shrimps, but have you ever heard of gumbo potato salad? http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2011/02/creamy-gumbo-potato-salad-recipe.html 
Happy Valentine's Day! Wishing you a day of love. To the world you may be just one person, but to one person you may be the world. That could be your child, your friend, your mom, your dad, your brother, sister, a neighbor, your lover. Love comes in many forms. Have a beautiful, yummy day!
Morning! Made my full "homemade" spaghetti meat sauce recipe yesterday. Set aside half of the sauce it in the freezer to make lasagna. Made with meatballs? Make extra & transform them into meatball sub sandwiches for another meal. Make extra noodles & spaghetti pie becomes another meal! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/03/easy-homemade-spaghetti-sauce-with.html 
Rounding down the week of Super Bowl foods with a few desserts. Remember this Moon Pie Banana Pudding? Several readers have already made it and loved it - would be a yummy dessert to share with your Super Bowl guests! http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2011/01/moon-pie-banana-pudding-recipe.html
Salaam, If any one wants to know the recipe for CreamRoll, please visit our discussion section. Thanks
Bollani Kachalool ~~~~~~~~~~ 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup water room temperature 1 tsp. salt 1 tsp. olive oil,1 teaspoon dry yeast 1 lb. russet potatoes (about 2 medium-size potatoes)1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro 1/2 cup finely chopped scallions white and green parts cup plus 2 tbsp. olive oil1 tsp. salt 1 tsp. ground black pepper 1 tbs.chopped fresh jalapeno 1/2 tsp.ground coriander gashneeze khoshk) Instructions:Mix the flour,yeast and salt together in a large bowl. Slowly add the water and the teaspoon of oil and mix the dough together, kneading it a little until it forms a ball. If the dough is too dry to come together, add more water, a tablespoon at a time. Once the dough is formed, knead it for 10 minutes on a lightly floured cutting board. If you are impatient like us, set the timer so you wont reduce the kneading time. Put the dough back in the bowl, cover with a cloth and let it rest for one hour In the meantime , boil the potatoes until soft in the center when pierced with a small knife. Remove from the water and when cool enough to handle, slip the skins off the potatoes. Put the potatoes, cilantro, chopped scallions, 2 tbsp. of the olive oil, salt and pepper in a bowl and mash together with your hands or a potato masher until thoroughly combined. Some lumps are ok. You can also make this the night before and keep it refrigerated until ready to use.Take a small amount of dough the size of a small apple and roll into a smooth ball. Spread some flour on the wood board and roll out the dough using a rolling pin. Continue to flatten the dough until it takes a round shape, is as thin as a tortilla, and about 10-12 inches across. The thinner the dough the better. If you have trouble rolling the dough to the shape you want, use a lid from a pot to trace a perfect round shape. Spread cup of potato mixture on one side of the dough, leaving a 1/4 inch border around the rim. Fold the other half over and press the dough together with your finger to form a seal. Get a Electronic griddle or lr saute nonstick pan add 1 teaspoon oil or brush the griddle w/ some oil put the Bolani over the griddle flatted more w/ your hands so the Bolani is more thin and cook it over medium-high heat. Brown both side of the bolani golden on both sides. Lay cooked bolani on a paper towel.Serve w side of home made yogurt and chatni
Recipe: 5 eggs 4 cup " Jiffy " flour and 1 cup 10 oz salted butter or 1 full cup canola oil with 1/2 teaspoon powder ( for extra salty taste) optional 1 hand full reg flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon cardamom 5 Eggs Add milk to make a nice firm dough (start w/ less than half cup of milk) If needed you can add more ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Add both flour,baking powder,cardamom, into a big bowl mix it w/ an electronic mixer for couple minutes than the rest of ingredients mix it for another 4-5 minutes. or until a nice firm dough.cover top w/ a plastic food wrap leave it for about 25 minutes. this mixture makes anywhere between 30 to 4o .Depending on the size Combine all the ingredients to make a firm dough ,take a little of the mixture and form it into a ball about the size of an small plum or walnut ..than put your thumb in middle of the small size ball dough and twisted half way ,than design with a knife around the cookie dough and flatted a little bit ..brush the top with egg yolk and a few black seed on top bake 350 degree for 15 minutes or until golden brown ..Also put the cookie tray in the middle of Oven Rack I f you find " Jiffy " All purpose baking mix than you shouldn't add any extra baking powder..
*Chapli Kabobs*~recipe ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ingredients: 3 Ib Ground meat (beef or lamb) 1 bunch Green onions thinly chopped 1 bunch of Cilantro (chopped) 1 teaspoon fresh minced Garlic 1 tb spoon Coriander Salt to taste 1 teaspoon Hot red chili peppers (optional) 1/4 cup reg Flour Vegetable oil to fry black pepper (optional) 2 fresh fresh jalapeo (chopped) 2 whole egg ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Instructions Take ground beef or ground lamb, put it in a bowl, and set it aside. In a blender or food processor, chop finely one bunch of cleaned green onions, one bunch of washed cilantro. You want the mix to have the consistency of paste or else you will have chunks of ingredients sticking out of the kabob and the small pieces will burn upon frying. Take the mix out of the food processor and into a clean medium sized bowl. To the mix, Mix the rest of the ingredients together well If you would like to make the chapli spicy, then add Jalapenos (fresh or canned) to the food processor stage. I recommend using the canned Jalapenos as these come in mild or hot. For extra heat, take 8 whole dried red chili peppers and empty the seeds into the mix, then take the red skins and grind them into a powder and add to the mix. The seeds contain the heat so be careful about how many you add. When all of the ingredients are mixed well into the meat, it should be soft but not sloppy. If it is, then add a little bit (1tbsp) of all purpose flour. Do not add too much flour or it will ruin the taste. I recommend using non powdered disposable gloves that you would use for cleaning or at a Dr.'s office to mix the meat. You can buy these non latex gloves at the grocery store (use nitrile or polyurethane NON POWERED). In a frying pan add 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and put on medium heat. To make the kabobs uniform, take enough mix to make a ball - about the size of a large golf ball and roll the mix into a round ball in the palms of your hands (much like making meatballs). Next, flatten out the ball by pressing from the center out and turning the ball until you have a patty about 1/4 inch thick. You do not want them too thick because the outside will cook and the inside will not. Once the oil is hot, carefully lay the kabob into the pan away from you in case of splatter. There should be enough oil to almost cover the kabob but not quite; remove any excess oil with a large serving spoon (carefully) or add more oil if needed. The kabobs will shrink by about half so don't worry if they look large when you first form them. Also, do not make them so thin that they rip when you put them into the pan. Press the kabobs down with a spatula as they have a tendency to arc up and the underside middle will not be as cooked as the rims. Just press till it stays flat. Give each patty plenty of room and cook until the kabobs are brown on both sides. If you are worry about oil splashing when you turn the kabobs, use tongs to flip the patties - just like you would a hamburger.( served with naan

This really is so much easier in that everyone can see who signs up for each day as they do it. It puts everyone in-the-know at the same time and we can see what others are bringing so we don't bring duplicates. Great idea!
Shared on Hypnobabies (Official) about this wonderful resource for new families in the immediate postpartum period! Thanks!
In the past 5 weeks 20 meals have been provided to one family using your online scheduling site. I appreciate this service more than you will ever know.
I had brain surgery on the 1st and we were set up for meals for a month within 2 days of my bible study setting up my page.. My recovery has been going so well being able to relax and just get better we even got to decline half of the meals after next week! This is such a brilliant idea! Thank you!
My MOPs group decided they wanted to provide meals for my family once a week until my baby comes. I am on bedrest (I can get out of the house on occasion with a wheelchair) and this is such a blessing. Within a day of hearing of their intent, they had a page set up!! This is such a relief for my family and I love how easy it is to coordinate. Thanks Shiloh Hills Mops and TakeThemAMeal.com. I feel so blessed!
Have you heard about this site? If you or someone you know is arranging meals for a family during a medical recovery, or any other reason, this site makes it very easy for others to know when a meal is needed! I know I have a lot of Christian friends this could help! Please pass along!
What a wonderful idea and service! We are using Takethemameal.com in Redding and easton CT and it is so easy and efficient. Thanks to the organizers who began this service. I have a feeling you might be Girlscouts...
A great idea from meal coordinator, Chris Williams: Leave a large cooler in the trunk of your car to transport groceries, potluck meals, and meals to families. Food stays hot (or cold) and the cooler contains any spills. Thanks, Chris!
A recent meal coordinator from Alabama created a schedule to provide meals for shut ins, widows/widowers, and single parents in their community. The meal coordinator had a list of people who would be encouraged by a meal and a list of people who would be happy to provide a single meal once a month. As you can imagine, she reported that putting the two lists together resulted in many smiles.

Love the Eggplant Parmesan!!! It's better than most restaurants I've tried!
I like the Eggplant Parmesan. It's better than Ukrops's Gourment. Three layers of plump tender eggplant. Just the right amount of sauce, breading, and cheese. A hearty meal for my dad and myself when I have to work late. Done in 17 minutes and no clean-up. Thanks Michael Angelo. You are an artist.
One of my Favorite individual Frozen meals that youguys make is the 4 cheese Lasagna. Lately it seems I can not find this kind in any of my local stores where as before all the stores used to carry it. I have looked on your where to buy section of your web page & am unable to find any stores that sell your products, Yet I know for a fact we do here in Az, I work for Fry's Marketplace out here and I have also been to Albertson's & Safeways as well & no luck so where can I find the 4 cheese Lasagna now? Thanks.

Letter of the week! "Our beautiful girl, Kizzy, pictured, didn't like dog food since we had her as a 10 week old pup. We tried many varieties and gave up. Kizzy has since been fed on poached chicken, raw chopped steak and vegetables with occasional lentils and brown rice. I ordered the trial pack hopefully. I was delighted to see it arrived today when I returned from work. When I opened a tin, Kizzy sat on her mat, doing her best sit. My son giggled and said, Mum, it's dog food, no way will she eat it. How wrong he was!! I put half into her bowl and she waited politely for me to say 'Go on then' Kizzy had a good sniff and proceeded to push her bowl around the kitchen despite it being empty. We were all in shock. Princess Kizzy eating dog food! As I said to my son, this isn't dog food, it is just like mum's and home cooked. Can't wait for her to try all in the goody box! Woof woof!"
A couple of Bedtime Biscuits did the trick!
Thanks so much for the lovely cooking course today. I took home so much great information on all the good herbs for dogs. Will definitely try those dried apple rings for Tigger. Pauline

Hello - I live in Austin Texas and my HEB, along with others, is having a shortage of your organic milk. There are signs posted but they don't mention the reason for the shortage, is it because of the weather or is it in high demand? In need of whole milk for my little guy! I've contacted my store but I haven't heard from them yet, can you shed some light?
In your DHA-supplemented whole milk, what kind of testing do you perform to ensure the algae (and the water it's grown in) is free of common water pollutants and contaminants? 
My husband and I, always wonder why Organic Milk can last longer than regular pasteurized milk? Shelf life for organic can be a month and the other barely two weeks.
any plans to make flavored organic creamer, like one of your competitors? I would so buy it!!
i love horizion vannliamilk its deloius
Sharing some happy stats on a snowy Friday here in Colorado. Horizon now works with more than 600 organic family farmers across the US. The smallest family farm is located in Vermont and has just 12 cows. Wishing everyone a great weekend!
Does anybody know if lactose free, organic milk exists??? I had given my 1 year old daughter horizon whole milk with DHA since she started on milk, but her little tummy can no longer handle the lactose. 
I went to my first Forensics Tournament yesterday, speaking as a sales rep for Horizon, I made it to the Semi-final rounds :) 
Just saw that article with you removing the natural fat in the "organic" milk, and replacing it with a chemical not allowed in organic food. You just lost my trust and my money! 
According to Cornucopia, the DHA in question(added to Horizon "organic" milk is a "synthetic additive" banned under organic standards. Horizon counters that it has been using the synthetic DHA for years in its organic baby formula other organic-milk products [see correction below], with the approval of the USDA. Cornucopia shoots back that DHA-laced formula has been shown [PDF] to cause adverse reactions in babies -- and adds that USDA recently acknowledged [PDF] that it was "incorrect" to allow synthetic DHA in organic products in the first place. 
Hello, I am a senior at the University of Kentucky and I'm working on a marketing project about Horizon organic milk. I was wondering if I could message someone about a few questions regarding your marketing and sales strategies. Thank you!
The 2010 Dietary Guidelines were released yesterday, and guess what? Americans aren't getting nearly enough dairy in their daily diets. Experts recommend 3 servings a day, and encourage us to choose low-fat and fat-free dairy most often. Have you had your 3 servings of dairy today? http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/dietaryguidelines.htm
With Valentine's Day just around around the corner - here at Horizon we are showing our love for our organic farmers because we just added 100 new family farms to the Horizon family! Which brings the total to over 600 family farms that supply milk for all those Horizon products you love. How are you showing your love this Valentine's Day?
Lots of questions out there related to our DHA products today, so we wanted to share some more details about why we have them, and where the DHA comes from. Check out this link for more details. 
Mmm... rich chocolate and luscious organic cream cheese. Great for Valentine's Day or any day. Are you in? 
Came home last night from Meijer and the entire side of my Horizon milk carton was split at the seam-- milk everywhere! What a pain!

I love your milk. I'm addicted to the 3 pack of the single servings of chocolate and strawberry milk!
my 2 year old son loves yalls milk!! In the doctor today he was getting blood drawn and he was crying i told him if he was good he could have moo moo milk (that is what he calls yalls milk b/c of the cow on front) he got so excited started yelling moo moo milk and forgot all about them sticking him
I live in Virginia and would like to know if you have half/half in the quart size? The pints are hard to find but I buy as many as they have when I find them. I love you products.
is the little Horizon milk cartons (for kid's lunches) recyclable?
Hi there! Will you have the small cartons of whole milk?? I know those do have to be refrigerated all the time, but it would be just wonderful!! also, where can we find coupons? I have emailed your customer service and she emailed me back telling me I can print them off your website/ I was explaining to her, that I am always recieving a error when they go to print. I dont think its my printer as other coupons are able to print. Thanks!! My 13 month old loves your milk! We go through at least 3 gallons a week:)
I love your MILK! It's the only one I can drink w/out problems. Thank YOU!
Hey everyone. I just received my $250 gift card from the Resolutions Sweepstakes. Thank you Horizon, thank you, thank you. Good luck to all in the grand prize drawing, you still have a couple of hours to enter.
My twin boys are finally getting nice and fat on your milk. Thank you for making such a good quality product that I can feel good about drinking/serving!
My son and I can't drink milk, but my husband and daughter L.O.V.E. it! At the recommendation of our nutritionist, I bought your milk. My husband says your milk is the best milk he's ever tasted in his life. Now, if only you sold it in gallon size - because my husband & daughter drink a gallon a day. Seriously. Breaking the bank, but I know it's healthy and they love it. 
My daughter and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE your milk! Thanks for the peace of mind that she's getting nothing but the best! :) & BTW, gallon containers would be great! 
My kids love the chocolate milk - best they haev ever had :)
I love your organic milk! My grandkids love the chocolate also! I haven't tried any of the other products yet, but after the storm rolls by, I will definitely be at the store! I'm forever sold on organics! Do you have coupons available?
My entire family loves the silky texture of your milk and the convenience of on the go containers. Chocolate is my son's favorite-very moolicious!
We love Horizon milk! I signed up for the Horizon site to receive the coupons you have listed and it is not working to print. I print coupons all the time, so I'm not sure what the problem is with Horizon coupons. Any help to get the coupons would be appreciated! Thanks.
I just bought the rennet-less string cheese sticks at Safeway a week ago! Love that I can still enjoy string cheese without rennet! 
I tried All the other Organic milks on the market and Horizon is the only one and I mean only one that did not leave a metallic taste in my mouth...just the best tasting milk I have had since my childhood, when we got the milk delivered locally.
Is Horizon a publically traded company? I'm interested in stock. I LOVE your products!
Does anyone know if the individual boxed milks will pass through airport security?
Where is it on sale?
Buy these for my home daycare because the kids just love them! Clean of any added hormones.
I LOVE Horizon Milk! I think that the whole world should know how amazing the taste is and how great organic milk is for you!!!!! 
Good stuff! I especially like the strawberry milk for special treats for my kids!
My son has taken one of the chocolate milk's in his lunch every day since he was about 3. He's 7 1/2 now! Great stuff!
Horizon cheese is so good!
yum - like their cheese
Does anyone know where I can buy the 18 pack of plain low fat milk boxes? All I can ever find is the vanilla and chocolate, and my daughter does not like them.
Is anyone else having a hard time finding 2% milk with DHA? I haven't been able to buy it for the past 2 weeks! When I ask the dairy mang at the grocery store he just says "we are having a hard time getting this" . We miss our Horizon milk with DHA!
I'm so addicted to your chocolate milk!!! Good thing is low fat ;)
My son tried the Vanilla milk in the "juice box" and LOVED it!! I am planning on getting him some next time we go to the store!
 I am on the Forensics Team at my school, in the "Sales" category. My job is to write and memorize a speech about a product and try to sell it to the judges and audience. I get to use visual aids in my presentation as well. In my speech I am to discuss the company's history, the product itself, why its better than competitors, and how the Company is involved in the Community, and/or is going green or organic in some way. If i can hit all of these key points I will be very successful. I buy Horizon Milk and am satisfied with it. I thought your line of products would be a good fit for my presentation. If you have any suggestions, facts, or visual aids you would like to send me that would be great! Keep in mind, this is free advertising for your company! 
I'm really happy that you are on the right side! I'm tired of all these big companies setting the "standard". Aren't we the consumers supposed to be doing that! I'm pretty sure anyone that is trying to support small family farms, which is A LOT of us, are opposed to the genetically modification of anything that we are eating. What is wrong with Wholefoods and Organic Valley?? For the love of all that is wholesome, keep up the fight Horizon!!! I will be supporting you more now then ever! 
Happy Valentine's Day! We're celebrating with pics from Andrew & Ashley Hardy's July wedding - complete with tractors, boots and hay bales.

Horizon- What can I do if I wish to buy your products but the stores near to me do not carry all your wonderful products? I feel like it is such a shame that I would have to drive an hour to purchase them when they should be in the 4 grocery stores I have in my city. Do I contact my store? Help on this matter would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for your wonderful Company!
I'm a little concerned about The Cornucopia Institute's organic egg study/scorecard during which they found that your hens are held in pens with a tiny opening to discourage them from roaming outside. I'm not sure why I've been paying $5 a dozen for them.....
Maybe it's my imagination but the gallon chocolate milk tastes so much richer than the single servings is it me, or IS there a difference? 
I am no longer finding Horizon milk at Target. Have they stopped carrying the brand? Do you sell at Whole Foods? Anywhere in RI or MA?
BEST MILK EVERRRR!!! <3 itt!! : )
I usually just drink soy milk until I met Horizon. :-)
Where do all those plastic ringed pour spout sealers (and screw top lids) on the milk carton go? Is it really necessary? Yes, it's sort of convenient, but is it really that much more convenient than the simple milk carton we all grew up with that doesn't add this extra bit to the land fill?
A Sunday breakfast of French Toast with Maple Syrup and sliced banana. The best bit of all - it was Slimming World friendly!! What did you have for your Sunday breakfast?

Thank god I discovered Ella's Kitchen! My daughter (also named Ella!!) is lactose intolerant and it has been difficult to find lactose free food suitable for weaning until I found you. Do you sell baby rice or porridge which is LF? I have only found the fruit and veg purees so far.
Just wanted to say ur products are fantastic. I started weaning my lil boy, Jack about three weeks ago and he loves your food. His faves are ur pumpkin, sweetcorn and peas and also ur carrots, apples and parsnips. Also just tried him on ur banana brekkie which he seems to prefer rather than porridge. Thank you for helping weaning be exciting and enjoyable :)
Just wanted to say how yummy your stage 1 pouches are! i had them with my 1st and now im using them with my 2nd. seriously delish and so handy to take out and about! seriously takes a weight off my mind knowing that my child is having nothing but goodness. thankyou so much xx
Just started Emma on solids today. Emma enjoyed the broccoli, pears, and peas and had no spit ups. I love that your products have no GMOs and organic. 
Hi, can you tell me if there's somewhere I can buy your fruit smoothies in the Netherlands (preferably in Amsterdam)? Thanks! x
my baby has been eating your baby foods for about 3 weeks now and he <3 it the best out of the other kosher baby foods from earths best and beechnut ! So thanks for making these and hope to find more of your foods in the US soon !!
Thank you for the spinach, apples, and rutabaga combination! Finally after 19 months of searching a green veggie my son will eat!!!! (We just braved that flavor today for the first time and he had it along side his lunch AND dinner.) 
Amazing product!! My 22 month old STILL adores eating each and every kind of pouch you make!!! It's the only way we can get him to eat like 90% of his fruits/veggies. Keep up the great work!!!
Just discovered your products, and they look fab!
Thank you so much for my weaning guide, got it through the post this morning my daughter who has just turned 3 is having a good old nosey :) x
I'm looking all over for your products and can only find a couple of them. I'm interested in the meat ones. I live in southern california, can you please tell me where I can find an array of choices? Thank you
just been and got some of your food can't wait to try it and its cheap as chips!! X
I wanted to thank you for your wonderful products and packaging. I have a 13 month old with pancreatic insufficiency and diet is so very important to him. He drinks these products like a smoothie straight from the package. He loves it and thinks its fun. Thank you Ella!
hi, i have just registered on your website,when can i expect my weaning guide? do i download it from the website?
Hi Ella's Kitchen. Can you tell me where I can buy some of your very yummy Cheese & Spinach Bakey-Bakies? Haven't seen them in Waitrose. Guidance would be appreciated! Thanks
Thanks for your wonderful foods! My daughter loves all the great flavors and I love the nutrition and easy, neat-to-slurp-from pouches. Just curious if you've ever come across re-usable pouches similar to those you use. I'd love to find some to hold yogurt, pudding, and homemade fruit & veggie purees!
I am totally new to your products, but i can't wait to try them out! just curious, can any of the pouches be eaten by older kids? I have an 18-month old, 4 yr old, AND 5 yr-old. Trying to get them to eat veggies is sometimes a challenge, so these would be great!
My 8 month old is sooo picky and so far ive only bought her the apple strawberry and she loves it! Also she loves to hold the pouch herself just wish they were a little cheaper
My daughter is 2 and sips the pouches, she thinks they are yummy. I only buy the veggie ones, cause she its the only way she eats her veggies. LOL. Babies R Us now only has the fruit ones, but today I found all the veggies ones at Target.
We love fruit smoothies!!
Drum rolll pleaseeeeeee..... we are now available Nationwide at all Target Stores!!!!!

b'Alcoa Celebrates 125 Years of Modern Aluminum. This month marks a milestone in American history that\xe2\x80\x99s known to few but benefits everyone. Thanks to the birth of the modern aluminum smelting process 125 years ago by Charles Martin Hall, thousands of products can be made safer, lighter, more fuel efficient and more recyclable.

The aluminum pellets created from this discovery are called \xe2\x80\x9cAlcoa\xe2\x80\x99s crown jewels\xe2\x80\x9d (see image) because it led to the patent Hall received July 9, 1886, and later the founding of Alcoa. \n\nLearn more and watch a video:\nhttp://www.alcoa.com/global/en/news/news_detail.asp?pageID=20110223005416en&newsYear=2011'

Taco Bell do not change a thing, I eat your taco's because I like the taste and the price is OK. If I want 100% beef Pattie I will make myself a hamburger at home. I never believed that the taco meat was 100% Ground Beef only. I must admit I was a little nervous about the meat a few years back when the little dog disappeared but I think the lizard got him after all.
Taco Bell keep up the great work for all those Taco Bell fans out there!

i frankly dont give a crap whats in the meat...... as long as it tastes good. taco bell is my disney land and always has been.
i just had you an hour ago
I have never seen a company so thoroughly and forcefully OWN someone filing a lawsuit against them. This lady not only will lose her lawsuit, she may even end up being bankrupted by Taco Bell. Don't f*** with The Bell, baby!!!
Don't worry Taco Bell. We still love you.
LOVES Taco Bell...and if you do too, and think the lawsuit Atty. "Dee" Miles has recently filed is a fraud and "get rich quick" scheem, You can call him and tell him that! 334-269-2343, use the search menu and enter 645 and then "1" when prompted for "Dee" Miles.
Taco Bell as a salute to those who cried out about your beef, in all split product restaurants that have buns, bring back the BellBeefer PLEASE!
you might want to stop reminding people of the MEAT Lawsuit .... out of sight, out of mind

Craving a steak chalupa right now...........
where's the beef?
i wanna say about the recent news and lawsuit that if it turns out your beef is only 35% and the rest is some chemical soup stuff. I'll say Gimmie that 35% chemcial soupy stuff > real beef anyday. Cuz that stuff taste GOOD!
I GOT TO GET ME A QUAD STEAK

What happened to my Taco Bell? The one I go to in Encinitas is all closed and the signs are even gone. I want it back. 
Did you know we also have a new Quad Steak Quesadilla? Four portions of new thick and tender steak, blend of three melted cheeses cheddar, pepper jack and mozzarella and creamy jalapeo sauce all folded in a freshly toasted tortilla. http://www.tacobell.com/menuitem/Quad-Steak-Quesadilla
Oh Taco Bell, How I love you.
why is it that double meat cost the same thing as sour cream. it's is like the sour cream is worth just as much as the meat. i think that the sour cream should be cheaper than double meat.
Tell me something that will make me feel better about what was on the news about Taco Bell...
to the people sewing taco bell: whats wrong with you?
i am munching on one of your delicious tacos right now, and might i say, it is supremely delicious!
Going Loco 4 Tacos! taco, taco, taco; taco bell it!!!!!
I live in Iquique, Chile and we don`t have taco Bell here, just in the Santiago but whenever I travel there I go directly to have a burrito or a quesadilla with spicy salsa. and NACHOS with cheese :)
Mmmm Soft Tacos [;
When can we expect a Taco Bell Classic...where you make everything like you made it in the 80's? That would be awesome. Bring back the olives, because my Enchirito needs them! :D
My favorite thing to get is a bean and cheese burrito with green sauce and onions! Love em!

Dear Taco Bell. I love you. Thank you for opening a UK branch.

Dear Taco Bell, I find myself hopelessly addicted to you. Do you know of any Taco Bell rehab programs? Thanks Jo
Please tell me it isn't true: Taco Salad discontinued??? SAY IT AIN'T SO !!!
just tasted the chicken for the first. its actually good. I might get it more often. 
Dear taco bell, I have never liked any of your menu items, for various reasons. Then a while back you came up with the Chicken Flatbread Sandwich for $0.99, and I thought "why not, let's see if this is any better." It was WONDERFUL! really surprised me! Tasty, cheap, not very messy, and actually HEALTHY-ish. So, my question to you is why in the world did you stop making this!!!! When this item came out, I went to Taco Bell almost every day and ordered 4-5 chicken flatbreads. now, I do not go anymore because you have discontinued this delisious little sandwich. Please, please, PLEASE, taco bell, bring back the chicken flatbread sandwich!!!
tacos are amazing i feel mexican
Taco Bell is my favorite fast food location!!! Crunchy sumpreme tacos....yumm!!!
When is Taco Bell coming to Germany???? PLEASE COME SOOOOON!!!
You know whats would be awesome... a chocolate empanada
Use 100% beef in your taco meat filling please. 
u are my best friend taco bell ;):)
I JUST GOT 4 LBS OF FOOD FOR 4 DOLLARS TACO BELL IS THE SHIT!!!!!
Just love the plain ole bean burritos . . .
If it were 0% meat it'd be "Vegan". If it were sold in SoHo for $40 a plate, it'd be "molecular gastronomy". So it's soy lecithin and maltodextrin. . . So what? It's delicious, inexpensive, and I'm gonna go get me some right now.
I would really like to see a news station research Taco Bell's claim that their "double" and "QUAD" items actually contain 2 times & 4 times as much meat in them, I am not a believer after trying the Quad Steak Burrito. Just look at the pics on Taco Bell's menu board of the Double Steak & Quad Steak Burrito and you will see that it is the same picture!! lol, also, concerning the "double" beef burritos, double the beef? I don't think so... 
I love you taco bell!
i have to say that the new shredded beef burritos are no good bought two and i am getting ready to feed them to the dogs if they will eat them
tacos<3
i think taco bell messed up on this burrito it truely sucks and i want my money back but i guess it was my choice to choose it so i am not going to complain any more. just dont get it. IT SUCKS!!! 
here is the funny thing everything i have posted on facebook under my post about taco bell has posted everything that i have posted under taco bell has disappeared hmmmm
so they refuse to have someone post comments about ther food now what gives is it all about '"where's the beef" 
GIMME A NACHO BELLGRANDE , CINNAMON TWIST, A MEXICAN PIZZA, AND A LARGE BAJA BLAST :)
hey do u people think that taco bell should have a lager varity of sodas and not just the same kinds of sodas and if they can screw up the parking lot then they can get more sodas for us 2 choose from
The quad steak burrito is okay, but it can't touch the cheesy double beef buritto. Please bring it back! I'm getting so depressed!

U need to deliver :)
I love you Taco Bell, its okay baby nobody's gonna hurt you or your business!! XOXO
Wow Taco Bell, can you please follow me back on twitter? I would be most honored :) My twitter is @anitacee ! 
Taco Bell, you're not only the most delicious corporate brand, you also have the best personality. I love the way you treat your fans, you're so human and warm, yet I also love the ruthlessness with which you treat your haters. I've been watching this entire lawsuit beef (pun intended) and the resilient no bullshit approach you've taken is surely admirable. You've got integrity and you're not afraid to fight back because you and all of those who love your delicious food know what you stand for. I am about go grab that 12 taco box. I love u, Taco Bell, I really really do. 
Taco Bell- Now with real beef.
I want some taco bell so bad, but im BROKE =[
WTF taco bell, i wanted some delicious food at around fourth meal time and you tell me you guys ran out of meat!? how do u run out of meat!? you guys dont even use meat! very dissapointed was i.

dude i love taco ball!!
COME TO ARGENTINA I'M DYING FOR A TACO BELL! :( HAHAHAHA
LOL. People let's imagine this lawsuit was true. Let's imagine that taco bell didn't use meat at all! It's bullshit... but let's picture it for a second. What the fuck are you so angry about?! If Taco Bell was so fucking genius they managed to make the most delicious tacos in the entire world without using beef then PETA should hand over their keys, we'd eat great food with no guilt of murdering innocent animals, and cows everywhere would rejoice at their emancipator. Hell, we'd have better diplomatic relationships with India now that they know that our most delicious food isn't even responsible for cow murder.
Really, if all this lawsuit were true, would it matter??? At all??? Would it say anything bad about taco bell???? We eat taco bell because it's fucking delicious, not because we need a beef fix, gentlemen, it's not like anyone in the world makes beef that even resembles just how tasty taco bell beef is. As a matter of fact, the whole reason this lawsuit exists was because some guy bit down on a taco and in a gustatory orgasm told himself "THIS CANT JUST BE BEEF, IT'S MEAT FILLING MADE FROM HATHOR (egyptian cow goddess)." so y u mad ppl?
taco bell is getting something with chipotle shrimp
Ima always b a steelers fan reguardless of a loss,,we playd hard though =) 
mexican pizza is amazing!!!!!!!! 
Lol im so hungry taco bell soundz sooo rite!!
Taco bell = fast food heaven D: !!! :)
In 1980 I worked for Taco Bell - Store #87. Let me tell you, the meat was real! I cooked it and served it to many happy customers. I was proud then as an employee and I am proud now to be a customer of Taco Bell. Thank you for all the great years for being on both sides of the counter.
Having my 4th meal for my first meal ... Beef Burrito Supreme, Beef Chalupa Supreme and a HUGE Baja Blast ... $6.66 hmmmmmm
thanks for a delicious lunch! Love taco bell!!
i luv taco bell!!!
Dear TacoBell - your Quad Steak Burrito is delicious, but not worth $5.70 by itself. Please place it on your 79, 89, 99 cent value menu. Thanks.
Guys, you should really consider putting a taco bell closer to boston. Like... inside boston. Also, and I don't think I'm the only one, I lament daily that taco bell doesn't deliver. I would seriously pay exorbitant fees to have any number of double-decker taco supremes delivered to my home.
The new steak quad burrito is the shit; juss sayinnn' (:
The Chili Cheese Burritos need to be brought back Taco Bell!!!!! Get with the program!
BRING BACK THE CHICKEN FLATBREAD NOWWWWWWW :)

To the gods of Taco Bell: Several years ago, a commercial was crafted for you. This commercial featured parodies of classic 70's songs, such as "Taco Man," instead of 'Macho Man', "My Tomato" instead of 'My Sharona', and "We got the Beef." My friends and I have scoured tape upon tape of recorded television shows from the early/mid 90's and have been unable to find it. The almighty YouTube does also not supply this commercial. Is there any possible way that you can reconnect the loving fans with this classic commercial? If anybody in the world can, it's you. Sincerely yours for life, Jim

Thank you Taco Bell!
Homemade tacos aint better. Theyr crap! You gotta go to the store, buy all the crap, go home, cook it all up, then you gotta wash dishes at the end of it all. Taco Bell, you just walk in with a few bucks, eat, and no damn dishes.
Gotta love Taco Bell's great tasting food I strongly support you
I love taco bell!! what ever happened to the macho nacho bell grande you guys had like, 10 years ago? that thing was so awsome! It had everything! Please bring it back! Fire sauce rocks!!! you guys should sell that in stores
Taco Bell --- can vegetarians substitute beans for the beef on their taco using this coupon? 
I LOVE TACOS!
My free taco print page keeps refreshing and it says "Initializing Print" about 1/10 the download bar, and the refreshes again. WTF?
it would be nice if a Taco Bell opened up in Desoto, MO or Hillsboro, MO. I love Taco Bell but its not worth the 20 min drive to the closest one, & if my husband goes & gets it the tacos are soggy & cold when he gets back. We don't eat Taco Bell as often as we used to. :(
I love tacos from taco bell.
Thanks Taco bell for the coupons!!
Yeah. Free taco. Just printed my coupon!

Thanks for the free taco coupon!! I heard about this from The Coupon Wizards.
i. enjoy. your. tacos.
I LOVE taco bell
Dear Taco bell, I recently saw on the news that your being sued because you claimed you use %100 real beef. Hm. Honestly, all taco bell lovers dont give a crap if its %100 or %1, whatever it is, its awesome, and we love it. Dont change a thing. Seriously we dont care, so don't be afraid to post it loud and proud that its not %100 real beef. I eat baloney, there's no difference. <3 love you guys always. Cherrie effin B.
Thanks taco bell
I couldn't print it...something about needing Smart Source installed? Oh well....no free taco for me...
i get an error message after clicking "print" the free taco coupon. bummer! was gonna go to Taco Bell for the first time in years!
i just want to say that as vegetarian if none of your tacos had meat that would be fine with yours truly!
i am goin to own a taco bell one day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(:
What a scam.... Went to the local Taco Bell and they would not accept Coupons printed off the computer!!!!!
I dont eat meat anyways, so I don't care about the lawsuit! I <3 you Taco Bell!
FREE taco sounds good, but there is not meat in it, on going law suit on taco bell for advertising beef when the FDA says there isnt any in it
i love taco bell i eat u everyday... i love u
Ta-co, Ta-co bell....I'm gonna eat, some Taco Bell!!!
When I click to print the coupon for the free taco, it says print request denied. Abnormal request. What can I do? Thanks for the help! =)
I think you guys should take ideas for new quotes to put on the taco bell sauce packets. This would be a good, fun thing to do to see what people can come up with. 
I love you Taco Bell.!(: You make my tummy HAPPY(: 
Bring back the cantina tacos. Those were really good. especially with fresca sauce and quacamole. It was actually mexican food. :-)
Will they bring back the pork carnitas? Those things were awesome! 
My free taco coupon wouldn't print...help!

I love you Taco Bell. Please don't bring back fish/shrimp tacos. A new allergy sign just went up at our local TB, and I guess they are bringing it back. I can't eat there when you do this because of my allergies to shellfish... You loose a lot of good customers who have seafood allergies. My whole family quits going as well. 
dont put sand in ur beef!

Woot! Woot! No beef tacos for FREE!!!
Love me some Taco Bell grew up on it and my kids love it keep doing what you are doing Taco Bell and I will keep eating. Much Love from San Antonio Tx.
For the people that visit Taco Bell frequently, we really don't care if it's real beef or not. It still tastes good. There will still be a demand despite the "new" news. Really wasn't news to me, and most people I know, but whatever. End of story. 
Taco Bell rocks in the fast food world!
dont change a thing taco bell dont change a thing
Please bring back the green onions for the nachos. I think they are safe now.
I LOVE YOUR NEW COMMERCIAL!! THE ONE WHERE THE MAN IS SINGING AT THE PIANO!!! IT IS GREAT!!! 
Don't care what the beef is...cuz Taco Bell is delicious :P
Thanks for the offer. I love Taco Bell!
Thanks for the coupon Taco Bell!!! I heard about you from The Coupon Wizards!!! Check them out for other good deals. BTW I had Taco Bell for dinner tonight and had my free taco! 
I wish your beef was not 35 percent real. 
Defend Taco Bell From the lawsuit
I Love Taco Bell Taco's I Eat There a Lot Hear in Shelby,NC I got My First Tast When I was 5 I Had a Bell Buger a LONG Time a Go in The 1970's and Still Love Taco Bell Take Care and God bless. Chief Jay Flora Cleveland County REACT Shelby,NC
What is the "beef"? It's a 99 cent taco, not a 4 star restaurant meal. I love TACO BELL!
Taco Bell tacoas are the Greatest!!
I LOVE TACO BELL!!!
Today...well, yesterday technically, was my birthday and TB was the last thing I ate lol YAY CRUNCHY TACOS AND PEPSI! lol (No, I'm not drunk-just EXHAUSTED!) 
I <3 taco bell!!
Just wondering about the beef its 35% meat.... so its 65% of what after that??? I still love Taco bell :)
I love taco bell! U guys need some Celebs to sponsor u guys for commercials... that would to wonders!!!! F* that lawsuit.. they just mad or crazy!!
Love your lime drink .... love you!
I love these things! They question the quantity of beef --- who cares -- they are delicious. So it has some oatmeal added --- it makes it healthier. Meatloaf has oatmeal or cracker crumbs added, no one gripes about that. The bottom line is --- they taste great. I just wish sometimes that they would FILL up the shell.
I don't have a printer :( But I looooove taco bell!
Free Taco=best thing ever!!!!!!!!!!
Taco Bell Is so cool!
Your free taco coupon thing socks! It won't run under Chrome
kierooooo taco belll :DDDDDD
Maybe meat maybe not, but I love Taco Bell just the same.
I have my own food version of "don't ask don't tell" just like sneaking veggies into my kids food as long as it tastes good and won't kill me I'm cool. I'm sure there are many things we wouldn't eat if we really knew what was in it!
taco bell is the shit!!! way better than chipotle

The family and I LOVE Taco Bell!!!!
I love Taco Bell. Doesn't really matter how much beef, we were eating it before we knew so why the problem now? 
The meat is healthier then other places seeing how its 35% beef means tht what else could it b? Soy?! And the meat tht is in it is 100% grade A beef, so Shut up stupid! Ur gonna lose ur case! 
i love taco bell !!! yummmy !
Yo quierro taco bell!
Okay, Taco Bell! Beat those little lawyers up! No one cares how much beef you have! We want our TB! 
Need free taco wow 
Love me some taco bell
I love those burrito supreme. I get them with no onion, sub beans for meat and extra sour cream. Yum Yum 
Thanks for the Coupon for a FREE Taco!!!! Pass it on FB Fans!!!
I have come to terms about the Beef.......What is the chicken?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!
i love your tacos! lol 
I worked for Taco Bell for a few years in the 70's. Their beef was not fillers. It is ground beef with package of seasonings. I know because I had to make it twice a day. Hoping nothing has changed since then. 
Love taco bell tacos
Love Taco Bell food
Seriously? Why are people up in arms over how much meat is in the taco? Let's be real here. The group that are suing are just money hungry, knowing damn well on any drunken night they are going to run for the border. We have eaten way worse things in our food I am sure, then to be worrying about if it's 35% meat or 85%. GET REAL... 
You shouldn't tease a free taco if your software is too buggy to actually print out the coupon.
Go to Taco Bell and click "Like" print a coupon for a Free Taco!

Free taco please mmmmmm
Taco Bell provided me with the TERRIBLE customer service this week. After not being able to answer a simple question about a billing dispute. The manager failed to provide me with a number to call and complain, stating the number is on the reciept, and if I were purchasing something I would have that. After giving me an extreme amount of attitude and rudeness she asked if she could help me or I needed to leave, and I asked for the supervisors number one last time she then proceeded to call the police on me. It appears that the calling of the police and having my cars license plates called in to them is not 1/100th of a big deal to you that it is to me. After talking to the regional general manager, it appears to me that customer loyalty is sacrificed for employees with terrible judgement. I had the police, with the authority to detain me, called on me. With all the people out their that need jobs, I do not see how that manager is the most qualifed to be serving your loyal customers.
TRYING TO PRINT COUPON. I AM AT THE PRINTING SCREEN AND IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE PRINTING BUT IT HAS BEEN OVER 10 MINUTES - NO PRINTING YET!!! IT SAYS IT WILL TAKE UP TO A MINUTE - YA RIGHT!!!
I like taco bell. Ch.7 says I get a free taco if I like you taco bell, and I'm hungry. Also you say your "beef" is actually 88% real beef. Can I have a taco now?
Free taco!!!!! I love taco bell mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm sooooooooooooo GOOD!!!!!!!!

how do I get free taco?
TACO BELL IS VICTORIOUS OVER ALL RESTRAUTS
Wish I didn't have to print a coupon to get my free taco. Can't I get an SMS code or something? 
I've got an idea for Taco Bell's PR team. If it's only 35% beef, figure out a way to lower that amount, and market it as vegan and/or vegetarian friendly beef. GENIUS. REGARDLESS I'M A SUPPORTER
yess!!!! im gettin that taco b
Thanks Taco Bell!!!!
Could have used the coupon yesterday, when I went to Taco Bell for lunch!! LOL
I had a printer problem & my coupon didn't print. Now it says that I can't re-print it even though it was never printed from the beginning. :( Could you email me a coupon, please?
Yeah I "Liked" you, and error came up, and my coupon did not print, So no free taco for me :(
Thank-you for the free taco! I've first tried Taco Bell in 1979 in California. Been a customer ever since!
Wish you delivered in this icy weather. Could really go for some yummy taco bell.
I still love taco bell....
Thanks for the taco and I hope you put those shysters out of business. Exactly the kind of ambulance chasers that give the legal profess...cant say the phrase...lawyers their stereotyped bad name. They file a class action with no regard to whether it has any basis in fact, settle for pennies per individual with 75% of the settlement value going to legal costs. I did no research on the actual values stated above, but then again neither did they.
yo quiero mi taco con carne authentica por favor. ahora!
I did not get my coupon for my free taco! Starting to dislike!
Taco Bell is the greatest place there is to eat. I drag my husband there at least once a week!!
Thanks for the free taco!

I wanna free taco but no printer:( Only have facebook mobile!! TACO BELL IS THE BEST FAST FOOD TO EAT!! Been eating there a long time. Since i was younger i am now 35!! Keep TACO BELL UP!! :)

Taco Bell is awesome!
Pretty freakin dumb to advertise free taco coupons when their impossible to print out..can NOT download smart what ever the fuck it is.

I was very disappointed by the free taco I received today. First of all - I actually DIDN'T get a "free" one - because they didn't process the coupon. THEN - it was the soggiest taco I've ever seen. I ended up throwing it away - along with the other two that I purchased! :( 
DUST FILLERS IN THEIR MEAT --EWWWWW
I could not get the coupon for the free taco to print
I juss had a chicken soft taco with jusst chicken cheese and sour cream you fans should try it with a baha blast and hot sause yumm and thanks for the free taco coupon. I LOVE TACO BELL!

it wont let me print it off wtf and you just want everyone to like it beacuae you dont use 100% beef.
TRIED TO PRINT COUPON-24 hours later, still unable to print-but still love Taco Bell
I can't get the coupon to print because my printer takes a password and this coupon software bypasses the normal print dialogue box. It's not that big of a deal since it's just one free taco, but why would you make it so hard to get if it's just one taco? Couldn't I just show the guy on my phone that I'm a fan? 
i love taco bell !!!!!
I love taco bell!
Yum yum TACO!
I don't care if your tacos contain adorable puppy dogs. They taste great and are a comfort food I'm needing right now.
I eat Taco Bell everyday. Thank you 7 hills.
oh shoot! i think it is time to get my taco bell fix on!!! i dont know why they had all of the hoopla about taco bell meat being 'mixed' hell mcdonald's hamburger is full of soybean and tastes more and more like damn bad school lunch meatloaf plus it makes you high tail it to the toilet. keep on rocking taco bell!!!!
Is it just my area or is taco bell not putting that white sauce (not sure what it is) in there cheesy gordita crunches anymore?
free tacos yeah baby
I like tacos. But I don't like your coupon deployment system. Why hate on those of us who use Firefox? Switched to Safari and got closer but then your app locked my system. Boo. 
"Subject to availability;..." Or printability. It does not work for me in Safari, Firefox or Chrome. Taco FAIL. I know an agency who could help you on your next effort.

Thank you Taco Bell for standing up to the garbage lawsuit. I'm tired of people complaining about things and filing lawsuits because it doesn't suit what they believe the world should be. What happened to common sense and rational actions? 
Thanks Taco bell keep up the good work

Thanks for the free taco that's worth $0.50. How bout some more value? It's not like fake meat is expensive.
post prices for each state on your site and DELIVERY IN ABERDEEN, MD PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I only hope that the Bangalore Taco Bell store does not serve beef, else you can be ready for a public outrage.
Free taco lmao
I've been trying for 2 days to print the coupon. I can print all my other coupons from all the other websites and links, but not this one. I even tried Internet explorer and could not get it to print. You would think with all of the problems people are having Taco Bell would let you print it from facebook like HY Vee does.
Ta Ta Taco Bell
I <3 and support Taco Bell. Always have. Always will.
Taco bell i love ur food but miss the green onions.u guys r the best thing that ever happened to my tummy.on my way to u guys today!yum yum yummy i got taco bell in my tummy!

Here's my thing. I make meatloaf and always put a bit of a filling in. It makes it healthier and taste better. I don't know why people are making such an issue. Shouldn't we be trying to reach World Peace, Come on people!!!
It's easy to say that all beef is 100% USDA inspected... not that easy though saying it is 100% certified, right? ;)
i work for you guys and i gotta say. not getting sick of it yet. i love going home smelling like burritoes
YUMMY! I <3 TACO BELL!

can taco bell workers used this free coupon? 
Yo quiero taco bell!
Mmmmm, my favorite, crunchy beef taco! Thank you for the free coupon. I will so enjoy it!
go taco bell (:
Common sense on the "not real meat" issue at Taco Bell. Go vegan. See if you can find fake meat that convinces you that it is the real thing. Go to a health food store; try to buy fake meat that is indistinguishable from actual meat. Can't do it. If my beloved TB had figured out a way to bilk people into believing they were eating beef when they really weren't? That'd be nothing short of miraculous.
Taco Bell is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I used to work at taco bell......lets just say, its more enjoyable just eating it, not makeing it. lol
Coupon for free taco does not work! I got NO COUPON! No matter what I did!
I WANNA FREE TACO DO U DELIEVER???
I am a vegetarian. Can I use the free coupon to for a free bean taco instead?
You are my escape for my niece and I when her father comes over and starts to break pictures, yell at my grandparents, and demand money. Literally a life saver for us.
I miss you taco bell!!! You need to open a chain in London!!!
if there was a "love" button instead, i would have hit that.
It is not letting me print off the coupons for the free taco.
Your free taco give-away is a very smart advertising strategy. Well done.
Thanks for the free Taco!

Taco bell is amazing Beef combo burrito with extra red sauce + sour cream is the best thing ever.
Fake meat? Whatever, it's delicious.
Look I dig your food, but dude...come on be straight up with us.....what the fuck is in the meat? If its horse or kangaroo just fuckin say so....chances are we'll all still eat it anyway, but be fuckin straight up man
Taco Bell in Oxford Ma is the worst I used by free taco coupon and the taco had hardly anymeat in it. That is sad considering they are trying to get people back. This particular Taco Bell is always skimpy on everything.
Ok . . . How do I "unlike" this thing. I don't really want Taco Bell commercials on my FaceBook page.
I love you Taco Bell!
what happen to the tostada... yall have all the ingredient to make them.. also why are the bean Burrito $.99 when yall sell bigger Burritos for $.89 and $.99.. sometimes i like to kick it old school.... should be $.79.. bring back the chili cheese burrito too... 
Its beef ask for a tour to look if u thnk its not real.and if u dont thnk its real or dont like it Dont Eat At TACO BELL its that simple. Isnt that right taco bell lovers? 
i remember when i ate taco bell every day for 2 week.. sometimes hitting up 3-4 locations a day... this was an attempt to when a xbox (old school one).. guess what... i won!!!!
i love how taco bell has something new every could of weeks.. whens the last time mcdonalds came out with something new..
TACO BELL ROCKZ MY WORLD 
5 Layer on a 12 instead of a 10 with lava and creamy jalepeno, boken up frito chips and one extra pump of sour cream... i have other ideas to!!
Where's my free taco??? Got to go with the cheesy bean burrito!!

Where's my tacos I'm hungry
Tried to get in on the coupon for the free Taco but the coupon thing said I hit my back button but I didn't.....really bummed.
I love you Taco Bell :P
Gotta unlike you, after seeing the special about taco bell having less than 30% meat in their food, thats disgusting. Sorry. Not saying other fast food places are top notch, but, less than 30% is crazy.
Why can't I print the coupon from Firefox? Tried to print with Safari as recommended for macs and it froze up. Come on, Taco Bell, I applaud your food inventions and I want to like you, but making this coupon for one single taco such a pain in the neck is not the way to get people on board with your mostly-meat beef.
I can tell you what's not to like about a free taco offer. That is an offer that can't be accessed if you have a Mac and run foxfire, and there is no mailed alternative available. Guess I won't be getting a free taco anytime soon. Diane
Free Taco -- not for me -- unable to download the needed JAVA program to print my coupon out -- oh well. Thanks anyway
I have been trying to print my coupon for a free taco.No such luck.
no free taco for me. wouldnt let me print. o well. it doesn't mean im going to unlike taco bell like the other immature people. lol
Cant print the free taco offer. Why?
Does anyone else miss the Taco Light or the old style circa 1988 Enchirito- ( Corn Tortilla)? I wish they would bring some retro items back.
I don't HAve a printer to print my free taco coupon!!;-(
is it me or when i go onto the taco bell home page do you start smelling the taco bell?
Dear Taco Bell, WHEN are you going to bring back our beloved Chicken Flatbread sandwich????
Yall meat isn't real its a grae above dog food. Which is grade E that is nasty 
Aleways the Best
Gotta 'unlike' u cuz u say i already printed coupon, which i have NOT. A few of us share a computer, & they were able 2 print theirs, but u won't let me print mine. Booo!!
Ticked Off, your Taco Bell with the get one taco for free, even look at my coupon, the manager was nasty and would no honor it.....so I did not buy nothing......whitehall, PA do not go there.....
I LOVE TACOS 
Great ... Just Spicy Right ... Yummmm!!!
FUCK YEAH I LOVE ME SOME Taco Bell!!!!!
So Wow thought I was gettting a free coupon for a taco and have spent hours because of a problem with Java. Just as soon pay for one not good Taco Bell.
Well, they taste 'Just Spicy Right' ... But, Your Coupon Won't Print!!! What good is a free Taco when it's not "FREE"?
I tried for the free coupon and it said that I already printed it. Not true just was getting ready buy the whole family lunch there. Now I will go somewhere else. Too bad you lost a big order!@!
WHAT DO I DO??!! I had trouble with the java stuff, got that running, but then the default printer was the WRONG printer, but when I changed it to the correct printer, it wouldn't let me try again. ARRRRGGGH. I really DO deserve a free taco. The particular store in my area is REALLY bad at getting orders right- but I never complain. Please let me have a free taco. 
I currently reside in China, and I want Taco Bell so bad. Man it sucks.
how come some of the taco bells do not have the volcano menu? that's crazy!
you guys should deliver!
Thanks for the free taco coupon
Just had some Taco Bell last night. :]

How do you get the free taco?

I love your tacos.
i m gonna eat at taco tomorow

If your going to give people a coupon for a free Taco shouldn't all stores accept it? I know your a big company, but I bet you have a way of communicating with them all. Maybe you needs a lesson in logistics. 
LOVE TACO BELL
YO QUIERO TACO BELL!!!
Note to self: when printing free taco coupon, turn on printer. Thank you for the free taco!
Did you get your free coupons for TACOS
Hungry and craving something Melty, Crunchy, Spicy & Grilled? How about a FREE taco for Fourthmeal Friday? Click on the link to the Free Taco tab to print the coupon! http://bit.ly/tbfbfreetaco Help? E-mail us at facebookquestions@tacobell.com

the quad steak burrito is amazing
What happend to the chicken flat bread? theyy were awesome!! 
Dear Taco Bell, I love you so much. Why oh WHY did you leave me cold and alone in Saskatchewan? Couldn't you please bring the heat back? I'd melt like the cheese in your Quad Steak Burrito if you could just come back. Yorkton would be best, but I'd be happy if you could make your way back through the snow and ice to Saskatoon or Regina. Please Taco Bell? I miss you so. Forever Yours, Becky "Burrito's my middle name" Willems
This lawsuit pisses me off. WHO DARES TO SPEAK ILL OF MY BELOVED TACO BELL?!

Normally when I eat your salads I throw away the taco shell when I'm done. But tonight I broke up the bottom of the shell and ate it. It was hella good.
we need taco bell in wa, australia... :)
Just so you know, I wasted a good 5 minutes "ringing" the bell on the Taco Bell website! It's late and I'm craving Fourthmeal!
Can you just email me some? N where do I let you know my email? STILL won't work and according to the official Java Sun site, I have the correct version. SIGH.
i love you taco bell I LOVE YOU
Just went and got a regular hard shell taco, and a chili cheese burrito. AMAZING 
Thanks for the free taco, but I think it's kind of ridiculous that the location I went to couldn't put the sour cream on my taco, but was completely okay to give it to me in a ramekin container, but I guess it's cool.
had tacos and burritos for lunch :) love Mexican cuisine :D
Oooooo taco bell...i like the three layer burito i always order it...sometimes 2...there drinks are nice 2 they got promgernate stuff!
My 1st job was at Taco Bell, Store #44, Garden Grove, Ca. Things were alot different back then, 1986. My wife also worked at a Taco Bell. Way to go Taco Bell, and stand up to the lawsuit. My family and I will always eat here. Fast, inexpensive, great selection to choose from, and when you are hungry, they are available. I think it will turn out to be some great publicity, in TB's favor. Everyone needs to click like and print out that coupon. Thanks Taco Bell.
ew fake meat
Do u remember Taco Lights?
I love taco bell! Because of a misshap when the wife and I was dating we had Valetines dinner at taco bell. now for the past 26 years every valetines day we have TACOS!!!!!

Taco Bell doesn't like Macs
WHOOT TACOBELL!!!!!
I am very disappointed in you, Taco Bell. Getting rid of the cheesy double-beef burrito is unacceptable and I demand it's reinstatement! 
hahahaha you meat grade is lower than dog food 
I am a lil sad that Taco Bell got rid of Bacon. Way sad!!! Plz bring bacon back. I don't eat there much more without it. I only go back for Frutistas
Yummy! I Like Tacos!
I love Taco Bell!!!!!!
i am very sadden that you took the cheesy double beef burrito away and demand that you bring it back!!! 
taco bell is my fav place to eat every week end with my friends yummy

My grandson who has special needs and can't speak very well likes to say Taco Bell all the time and that is two words he can speak clearly. He is constantly wanting to say Taco Bell or go there to eat.

I'm a Taco Bell addict and have been since the 70's. Question: We have the new green sauce (verde) here in North Carolina. Is this really new green sauce or is the old green sauce from the 70s/80s revived? That old green sauce was discontinued but was gooooooood stuff!

i printed off one of the free taco coupons. then i scanned the barcode with a barcode scanning app, and it said "the coupon is invalid. do not accept this coupon." I feel like i just got ripped off. it's not free to print at this university. luckily i didnt travel the 25 miles to get to the nearest taco bell just to get my coupon rejected in front of my date. happy valentines day :-/

Since the new steak burrito commercial came out, every time my son sees something that has to do with taco bell he says "steak, I like tacos".
It wasn't free but we just enjoyed a fabulous taco bell dinner to celebrate valentine's day! Yummy Yummy. (no pun intended)
I hate that I love taco bell. It's my only regret about growing up in California.
Taco Bell, you have disappointed me one too many times. You will no longer be on my friends list. It began with you saying 1-11-11=5, then moved on to you only providing 35% beef and while saying you have 3/4 beef then when proven wrong said "it taste like beef to me". Our friendship can go no longer. I am going to eat at Del Taco from now on. They're cheaper and open 24/7 anyway.
yo quiero taco bell!
The XL chalupas are all bread!!! Might as well have eaten a gordita!!
te quiero taco bell!
your beef is fake
i love you taco bell :)
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF JESUS bring the chili cheese burrito back... chilito or whatever it is lol... At least to Tennessee cause it s the greatest burrito ive ever had and it really should be a part of the more permanent menu.....PLEASE SAVE MY TASTEBUDS
Thank You Taco Bell for the Free Taco! 
just another BUST trying to print the Taco Bell coupon =) Am I surprised? No....

I just want to thank u for my 5 buck box meal this shit is a mouthgasm!

I LOVE Taco Bell!

yall have done it man yalls new Quad steak burrito is the best burrito i ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you very much for the free taco. Was in too much of a rush Monday to savor. I promise to come back again soon and enjoy a normal meal with your Dorsett store!
who doesn't like taco bell
Just had some last night...so good!
u guys should deliver
Man that Quad steak burrito is pretty good. You know what else would be good? If you guys would D-E-L-I-V-E-R in Grand Forks ND and anywhere else in the country. Taco Bell could single handedly be saving the economy. Delivery creates jobs, tips, and some satisfied drunken bellies across America. If I was intoxicated I would want to sober up to a Mexican Pizza in my hand without having to drive. Imagine the News headline: "Taco Bell saves man's life via new delivery service! Taco Bell driver recieves handsome tip!" 
taco Bell,on target with taste, we love it here in louisville ky
Take Cinnamon Crispas and drizzle them with honey butter YUM
ahhhh. the other day i ordered a quad steak burrito. BUT,,,,,,, i got a double steak burrito.
The only thing I will ALWAYS eat here is the chicken case-uh-de-a YUMM
spokes person here.Are u ready for shrimp tacos!!
Thanks for the free taco Taco Bell! To bad my girl and I had a hard time using ours together. Even though the coupon said one per customer not per order. I wont go back to that Location! Why give us free stuff when its a pain in the butt to use? So we dont use them?
SHRIMP TACOS!! Any one
I want some Taco Bell right now but I'm stuck @ work & can't leave...so stop teasing me with this AD...LOL
i love you taco bell! without you snacking would not be fun!
TACO BELL! PLEASE COME TO GERMANY!!!!!!!
haha my man is manager at taco bell!!! <3 u baby
SHRIMP TACOS!! Any one
Is Taco Bell still offering the take home taco bar? 
$2 Chicken Burrito Deal (Diet Pepsi - the King of Soda) and Supreme Nachos for lunch!!! YESSSS!!!!! :)
Did anyone else have a hard time redeeming their free taco coupon? I tried 2 Taco bells, the first didn't accept it, the other took it but said they hadn't heard of the facebook coupon. Not complaining just wondering why the taco bell management had no clue of this when there are 10 million coupons being distributed?
just came back from having an amazing lunch at tb, had 2 hard taco supremes and a chicken burrito so yummy! 
Did you print your FREE Crunchy Taco coupon yet? Hurry! Today is the last day to print. No worries, if you print today. you have 7 days to get your free taco! Link to the Free Taco Tab: http://bit.ly/tbfbfreetaco Help? E-mail us at facebookquestions@tacobell.com
I printed my Free Crunchy Taco coupon, and I thank you for this promotion. I am a vegetarian, and I would like to know if I can ask for beans instead of beef when I redeem it in the store? 
Got to love it when people complain about FREE stuff. Jesus get over yourselves, people. Get to a freaking printer or try another computer. Or splurge and use up the rest of your paycheck to buy a 89 cent taco. No wonder Taco Bell doesn't do coupons. I wouldn't either if people btched so much about it.
shit! im really miss taco bell jajajaa
1) How long is the Beefy Crunch Burrito going to be around? 2) GRILLED STUFT BURRITO - CHICKEN ENCHILADA I miss you.
was waiting to pay at the drive up window and happened to read the warning about fish and shellfish: it said "perscado" when it should have said "pescado." Either the Spanish-speaking person they had proofing it was incompetent or they didn't use one.
I love how your guys meat is only 30 percent, that's not fake at ALL.
You guys need to make a customizable Taco!!
You guys need to get a Taco Bell in North Cape May ,New Jersey. We need a awsome taco place.
Thank you for the free crunchy taco!! It was so yummy!
Hey taco Bell when I Get Work For This Company?
Got my taco!
the computers at our school dont seem to have Java which actually sucks!!!! I want my taco!!!!!
Thanks so much for the free taco. I love taco bell.#5086 Casyville Il.
YOU ARE AWESOME! taco bell is my favorite place to go eat! 
Bring back the lemonade frutista! That one has been the best one so far! <3

I ate taco bell Saturdy
just want to send some love to the Drive Thru Lady at Taco Bell at Eastgate in Greensburg, Pa. She was the most pleasant person I've seen working a drive- thru in many years. She put a smile on my face just by being friendly.....Thank you!
Had the quad steak burrito today, pretty dam good.
Grilled steak taco is the bomb
how are you guys even still in buisness.on the news it said you guys only use 35% ground beef which is below health standards or something.i guess that explains why i throw up when i ate there last
Did you print your FREE Crunchy Taco coupon yet? What are you waiting for? Last chance to print it! Link to print the coupon on the "Free Taco" Tab: http://bit.ly/tbfbfreetaco Help? E-mail us at facebookquestions@tacobell.com
37% real meat , nuff said
No free taco for the MAC users > ( !!!!!
how can you guys eat it if theres only 37% ground beef.dont you want to know what the other 63% stuff your eating
How do I take taco bell off my fb page. Unfriendly them?
Taco Bell's beef is awesome! I don't know what's in it and don't care. Whatever the 67% of "other" ingriedents might be...it definitely makes the beef taste goood! If the extra stuff is cow brains, eyeballs, and intestines...then those organs taste a lot better than I thought they would! Just don't change what your doin Taco Bell. The beef is the best part of your franchise. For you haters out there...GET A LIFE and if you don't like it, don't eat it! You wanna raise hell about beef...talk to McDonalds. Taco Bell's beef is nowhere near as nasty as McDonalds. Just sayin
SHRIMP TACO NEXT MONTH, AND SHRIMP TACO BE READY THERE AMMMMAZING

Okay, I know it was FREE, still I had to drive out of my way to get it, thinking it was going to be a treat. My free taco looked NOTHING like it does in the picture. My wife and I both, who have frequently gone to Taco Bell in the past, were both amazed by what a puny amount of meat and cheese was in it. (There was no lettuce) And LITERALLY the taco shell was about 1/4 full. We both thought it was a mistake or something, so I had to park after going through the drive-through, go inside and they gave me another taco looking the EXACT same way. I'd never seen anything like that in all my years of going to Taco Bell. 
I tried to print the coupon and it would not allow me to print. I am disappointed. I would like a free taco. I also had a BAD experience recently with a TacoBell employee. He, as a cashier, was very rude... yelled at me and spoke like was an animal that had disobeyed. I had been polite to him and trying to help another customer, since he was busy. I really wanted to slap the boy, but I was taught better manners than what he gave.
Quad Steak= Amazing!!!
Annoyed that when I print out the coupon a giant color ad is also printed taking up 3/4 of the page!!! The amount of ink it wasted surely must me more than the cost of the taco. Thanks for the free taco though =/
the chicken burrito is the best
BEEFY CRUNCH BURRITO!!!
I really think this sucks, we went to taco bell for the free taco and then after were already there were told that you have to have the coupon well sorry i dont want to go all the way home and then come back it was advertised on t.v. to get one free today and it did not mention the fact you had to have the coupon, still no luck I think it is very bad advertising and customer disappointment once again I will never support your business again I will go to your competitors instead which is Del Taco. When you advertise for free then thats what it should be coupon or not. I really hope you lose your lawsuit now. S. Kwek Reno, Nv Keystone Av. Store.
I wish there was a Taco Bell in my small town.
I'm SO bumbed! I had nothing but trouble trying to print my free taco coupon! It never did print, and now it's telling me your records show that I have already printed!?!? :-(
I, for one, would like to express my outrage due to the fact that the price of the Beefy 5 layer Burrito has rose to $1.29 or so from the original price of 99 cents. OUTRAGE!!!!
so bummed, clicked to print my free taco coupon and it says the offer expired. It's only 9:23 my time in Cali and I missed it. :(
Can i get 2 soft tacos & a chessy nachos with beans!!! oh yeah a Med sweet tea please.. ;) 
YOUR BEEF IS NOT BEEF. THIS COUPON FOR FREE FALSENESS WILL NOT STOP THJE TRUTH!
33% beef!!! Whats the other 66%?
NEW YORK (MainStreet) Theres a brand new class action lawsuit against Taco Bell (Stock Quote: YUM) for a beef deficiency in its beef tacos. The suit points to open-ended questions on what exactly restaurants can and cant - get away with when it comes to truth in advertising. The brouhaha began with a class action lawsuit filed this week on behalf of a California woman, Amanda Obney, that claims that Taco Bell's signature beef taco contains less than 35% meat.

Thanks for responding to my complaint letter, Taco Bell. You really are a top-notch facility. *sarcastic tone emphasized*
Any chance of bringing back the taco light? It was the one probalby about 20 years ago that was a flaky shell and wrapped in foil paper? That was amazing.

TACO BELL'S MEAT IS MADE OF OSTEREG 
Check out the behind the scenes with Buddy Mignon. He reveals the juicy details of his love affair with the new Quad* Steak Burrito! http://www.youtube.com/user/tacobell?feature=mhum#p/u/3/1aWw8K0PUrs
Taco Bell is an addiction.
wheres my free food for life taco bell cant u just grant me this one wish?
Dude! Only 88% beef?! No wonder I got sick! Get your game together guys-go 100%!
Had one of the $2 meals yesterday for lunch. Hard to beat a deal like that, I can't pack a lunch for that price and I'm all about saving money. 
I love that new taco bell commercial singing about the succulent steak 4x the steak!! It reminds me of Queen's "Someone to Love" for some reason
Taco Bell = Dankness... just don't eat the sour cream.
so when i get a beef taco what am i really eating? Oatmeal? Fish? Oysters? Beef? 
WHEN ARE YOU GETTING CHICKEN FLATBREADS BACK !?
2 tacos for 99 cents. now.

Volcano nachos + volcano taco + volcano burrito + crispy potato soft taco + baja blast = My dream dinner.... I have had my dream dinner... it's delicious... Look like a woman, eat like a man<3
Mmm Me encanta taco bell
Love Taco;s
WHY DON'T I GET A FREE TACO?? It says the coupon has been withdrawn or something :( :( :(
Everytime you put something good on the menu, you jack up the price way too much. The cheesy double beef burrito WAS 89 cents and was awesome, then the quality went down and it went up 80 cents? The crunchbox WAS 5 bux and WAS good but once again, the quality went down and the price went up 1.99? C'...mon, you guys don't even use REAL MEAT! I am boycotting Taco Bell indefinately and I invite everyone to join me. You will most likey live longer without their "food" anyway. 
Taco Bell, although I get an ugly loud rumbly in my tummbly...I can't walk away and stop eating you!! MMMMMM 
Aw man, I need a dislike button; all the free taco coupons are gone. ;(
Bring back the Chilli Cheese Burrito!
If the free taco offer is over , then it should be removed. All I'm getting is the offer is OVER.

You guys should bring back the cheesy double beef burrito
Did you change your meat recipe after the law suite? I loved the way your tacos are but after the law suite i have noticed and so has my family that the meat does not taste the same. Its worse! bring back the old stuff NOW please!
Volcana taco rocks!
BRING BACK THE CANTINA TACOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I just wanted you to know that I've been searching all my life for answers of why we are put on this earth. Here and now, is my declaration of the Church of Taco Bell... a place were man can become one with the universe. Everytime I unleash my jaws on your delicious 5 layer burritos, crunch wrap supremes, or even an amazing chalupa or two.. my soul transcends to a place of peace and happiness. I devot my life to you Taco Bell, I give you my heart and soul... No fast food chain will ever mean as much as you have meant to me, nor will they guide me to the promise land. So say we all.
u should build 1 around carbondale pennsylvaia :) :) :) 
"Knock knock" Who's there? "Taco Bell." Taco Bell who? "TACO BELL DELIVERY!" ;) No joke.....THAT is something i'd like knocking on my damn door. Make it happen! To be honest I probably wouldn't have asked "Taco bell who?"..I would just open the door right away after hearing Taco Bell.
I work at Taco Bell. I still love it there. I still love the food. Haters back off. However, two things you should bring back: The chicken flatbread sandwich (at my store, it was as popular as the five-layer and that's hard to do) and the shrimp tacos. I loved both of those with an unholy passion. However, I heard from a little birdie that y'all just might be bringing back the shrimp...
was craving taco bell so bad......got lost on my way but found it LMAO
I ORDER THE 12TACO PARTY PACK ALL THE TIME!!! If you Love Taco Bell's Value Menu and Love TO BE healthy, please friend me. 
Ok, HOW do you get your cinnamon twists soooooo yummy? How did you come up with the glorious creation? NEVER stop selling them! They are SOOOOOOOOOO good!!!
would help if you let me print the coupon instead of getting directions, since i know how to get there and after printing directions there was no way for me to print coupon, that sucks big time.
Taco bell... I eat you everyday
Would like to give a Big Big Bell to a couple of emplouees at the Taco Bell in Bardstown, KY. After having lunch with my husband, I left without my purse, hanging on the chair. Their honesty brings hope and the method they used to let me know was stunning. They couldn't call me as my blackberry was in my purse but one employee saw I had fb on the screen so they posted on my own wall that I had left my purse there. I still had not noticed my purse was gone and it was a couple of hours later when I logged on fb as I usually do in the afternoon. There it was, the notice that my purse was at Taco Bell. I was able to return to the store, retreive my purse, gratefully thank everyone several times, and return home to let all know that Taco Bell is not only good, it is home to the Best Employees around. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!!!!! God Bless
i like tacos
I had one of your 35% beef tacos today and it didn't taste right. It was missing something other than the other 65% of beef. 
Was just at Taco Bell and was told they no longer have the cheesy double beef burrito. WTF? It was one thing to discontinue spicy chicken (chicken + hot sauce doesn't cut it), but this is a whole new level of low.
I can't wait to be reunited with you once agian tonight. 5 layer burrito no sour cream. OH... Yeah...
i am terrified to eat here now since it has fake meat!!!
You should bring back the Volcano Nachos :) please!
Never got my free taco, could'nt even get the coupon. It was prob fake and a way to get u to support them. I think they need to have a day and give them out like jack in the box did. They gave out two free tacos. Besides my taco bell here has never even heard of the coupons. They also need to bring back the chicken cesar burrito! 
you guys use cow trimmings and in the meat you put meat filling like sand and sugar gross!!!!!!!!!!
Dear Taco Bell, I would like it if you convinced my Boyfriend Nathan Hunter to let me have You Saturday. I haven't had you in a while and he won't let me have you. This makes me very sad as you are my favorite thing to eat in the world. Please convince him to let me have a chicken quesadilla. =D
I luv taco bell
The FREE TACO coupon is FALSE ADVERTISING to increase the number of people LIKING Taco Bell's page. If it wasn't, they would tell you BEFORE you click like that the coupon is NO LONGER AVAILABLE. I smell lawsuit!
i could go for a beefy 5 layer burrito ritgh now...
Who's ready for the weekend?!? Start it off with a Taco Party Pack! 12 Crunchy Tacos for just $10. http://www.tacobell.com/food/featured
Need to have the Chicken Flatbread sandwiches back for good...we all loved them around here...very tasty
I miss the XL chalupas and the Double Cheesy Beef buritos!!! Please bring them back!
Could you bring back the "BELLBEEFER"? IT WAS AWESOME!
I Like Taco Bell not for the FREE Taco, but I like reading the sauce packets. We hoarded them, think we just filled two sandwich-sized ziploc bags with them.
You guys really need a breakfast menu. . . Just add some eggs maybe some chorizo and waalaa 
ROCK OVER LONDON... ROCK OVER CHICAGO...! TACO BELL... MAKE A RUN FOR THE BORDER...!
Why doesn't taco bell have a breakfast menu!? Even subway serves breakfast!
gotta love that not real beef
Might want to change your privacy settings so that nobody can tag your pics-people are tagging bad language in your photos...
you really should check out the photo you posted--the tagging has gotten out of control and is very offensive...

i promise if you put a taco bell in or even near laconia new hampshire you will make ALOT of moneys ! :)
i love taco bell no matter what they say thats bad 
there would be alot less drunk driving if taco bell delivered
Dear Taco Bell #022606 (Canyon Park), Thank you staff for singing for Jorden's birthday! I can't tell you guys how much all 11 of us appreciated it. Also, thanks to the 10 other people who came! I paid for five, 6 people and it was only 20 dollars! Amazingly cheap food! Thank you!!!
did you change your beef filling? had tacos a couple days ago and the meat seemed different. not as mushy and no flavor. i didn't like it and will no longer be buying beef tacos again from taco bell if the meat filling did change
I want a taco like... RIGHT NOW! D':
I JUST APPLIED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please bring back the chives!! I don't care. I know what they did before. But, that didn't stop me, permanently, from eating at Taco Bell and eating chives. They're the essence of the cheesy potatoes. ;)
Dammit! I think I might've missed out on the free taco. :( When it was going on, I had no way to print anything. Now, I do. Perfect timing, huh? lol
Hey Taco bell come to Poland please, I miss this food :)

It's funny how you guys advertise sooo much steak right after becoming under fire for your 30% meat product. How people suffer through the shits by continuing to eat your failed food is way beyond my knowledge.

Bring Taco Bell to American University in Washington DC! 
i need ma flatbreads back! deAdass !! dem shits were dhee besttttt! 
A little while back I got a Quad-Steak Burrito, but I was really disappointed, it was really small. Though now I think it was made incorrectly, seemed to be about the size of a standard 99c burrito... I might give it another shot, but I dunno... $5 is alot for a single burrito, especially if it's gonna be made stupidly small! I think they gave me a regular steak burrito instead of a quad-steak by accident... Could I get a refund, so I can give it another shot? :D
Wheres the Taco Bell dog?
I love Taco Bell! Chalupas and chicken burritos are yummy in my tummy!
My friends and I have made many Taco Bells very happy. Who else rolls in and asks for the entire menu?
taco bell is awesome i love taco bell
i love taco bell one reasone is cuz it is a good place to eatand the second reason is that my nickname is bell
the quad steak aint even bigger than the grilled stuff burrito i would have expected it to be bigger
Quad burrito was meh, but your tacos are awesome.
So we definitely need a Taco Bell indorsment haha
I love working at Taco Bell! (:
I don't care what you put in it b,....Just keep it going dudes....Taco Bell RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You should make a pink taco for valentines day

I took the Not Real Beef stand of a minute, just because I didn't like it till recently. (Tnx, to Beefy Crunch!) Glad you all stood up and told us its real standing up from the normal Corporate ideas and waiting. You kick @$$ Taco Bell keep it up! ;D
Hey love taco bell, how do I get free coupons?

In defense of Taco Bell, I stand with millions of others who upon hearing that your beef has only 30 % real meat I say. "Really, THAT MUCH?"
Encirito no red add green and onions. = amazing c:

I love Taco Bell.I've been eating it for years........ will never stop.....love the price and the food......:)
That Quad Steak Burrito is the best! Never let that one go. Three days in a row if gone to get it. Yummy! Thanks Taco Bell!! =)
Hey..!!!...i want to @Taco Bell in El Salvador
If Taco Bell meat wasn't real meat, they would have been shut down a long time ago. Also, why would they put a lawsuit against the accusation knowing it would be tested if it wasn't real? 
As Taco Bell is one of my favorites, I want to suggest a marketing tool that can only "quadruple" business. A new slogan; that if utilized and followed, will have customers flying in the doors! If they use it, fine.i just want free Taco Bell forever!! Here it is!! 'WE MAKE IT LIKE THE PICTURE!" ......... yes, I am serious. :) 
All i can say is that Taco Bell is off tha HIZZAY!
Taco Bell I would just like to officially thank you for giving me something to look forward to after a two hours competition.
where can i download the quad steak song from the tv commercial ? Lol
You guys need to ban all these spammers about the meat. It's getting annoying and I know the company already responded to the complaints.
Also: if you don't like Taco Bell, do us all a favor and don't 'like' it.
TACO BELL IS CAMEL MEAT
Never thought I would say this, but there's actually too much steak in your quad burrito. 
i just had u .... i like it when ur inside me
You just asked: Whats your favorite Taco Bell Burrito? You got almost 1700 answers and over 100 of the comments mentioned a burrito you haven't had on your menu in over 10 years! When are you going to pay attention to what people are asking for and bring back the Chili-Cheese Burrito? 
So I was just really craving your new quad steak burrito. I left my house around 12:06am. Your hours of operation is usually from 11am-1am, am i correct? If so, then why was it that when I arrived at your drive-through, the lady at the window said that you're closed. It was 12:16am. 44 minutes before 1am, am i right? I... am very disappointed that i could not fulfill my cravings for the quad steak burrito. WHY U NOT OPEN TILL MIDNIGHT OR LATER LIKE YOU SAY?! 
Bring back the taco bell hamburger, it was great!!
Shrimp Tacos!!! Bring the boys back home!! Lx-D
Taco Bell car# 34 was 3rd in the Daytona 500! I was rooting for that car.
beefy burrito wth green sauce yummmm!!
I love both the new steak burrito and the new crunchy beef burrito. They are both really good. I think the new steak burrito is too costly though.
I don't care what's in taco bell meat. I will still eat it.
"I would like a burrito" "Chicken or beef?" "Camel&horse meat please!"
I love burritos in Taco Bell I eat them with mild sauce.
I LIKE SOFT TACOS:D
I LOVE WORKING THE DRIVE THRU Taco Bell
Please bring back the Light Taco that you sold many years ago. It was the one with the light, crispy, flaky shell and it came wrapped up in foil paper. OMG, that was the best!
Everyone help me suggest to bring back the chicken cesar burrito and if u have a suggestion let me know and i will do the same for u!!
I loue the chicken supreme chalupas so good yummy!
how do i get my free taco for signing up on your facebook page??? How do I get the coupon?
Very, Very, Very bad taco bell. These sites can be good or bad for businesses and today shame on you taco bell. You had me sign up on your facebook page to get a free taco. Well, guess what people let me share with you today, there is no free taco!!!!! Let's all come together and have them correct their error. Stop putting this up that are not true and they need to coorect this mistake! If it is not a free taco, you need to replace the offer with something else!!

Hey, I like Taco Bell as much as the next guy but the main reason I go there and take my kids is because I like to support David Gilliland, Driver of NASCAR 38 Taco Bell car. PLEASE help Bob Jenkins fund his team! He's putting your logo on his car with his own money, that's not right. Will you consider helping him out a little?
good run for Gilliland in the taco bell ford 
Hey Taco Bell, Think outside the bun!!!! Please get behind Bob Jenkins, Front Row Motorsports and driver David Gilliland. Go David!
Yay David Gilliland and Taco Bell!! Love you both!
I Support David Gilliland And The Taco Bell Car You Guys Need To Pay For Your Logo On The Car Not The Owner Its Not His Responsibility You Guys Better Get Your Act Together 
Go David Gilliland!! Show some support for FRM!!!
Great race yesterday for the Taco Bell team. Keep up the great work. 
How about some additional funding on the Taco Bell car this year? Way to go in one of the biggest races of the year!
Dear Taco Bell: Thanks for sponsoring David Gilliland but it would sure be nice if we could buy some merch. Please? The stuff we get is all outdated unless we make up our own somehow. Let us know ASAP. Thanks for sponsoring the best driver in NASCAR. 
thanks Taco Bell for sponsering FRM ... what a great race yesterday ... my fav. driver David Gilliland & FRM did a awesome job ... Im sure, with your "help" it will be not the last good finish this year 
It was very cool to see David Gilliland and Front Row Motorsports bring Taco Bell a podium finish at the Daytona 500! The brand got so much attention yesterday! Hopefully, this will encourage Taco Bell to help out the team! 
i love taco bell!!!!!!!! lol im on my way now.... so where is my three free tacos jkk :)
Why yes, it did just take me 8 taco bell hot sauce packets to eat my crunchwrap! Taco bell did not take off in Korea but there are Koreans that love you! 
I HOPE THAT ALL TACO BELLS WILL HELP SUPPORT THE TACO BELL CAR THIS YEAR! I ALWAY'S GO TO TACO BELL BECAUSE OF THE TACO BELL SUPPORT FOR DAVID GILLILAND. GOOOOOOOO DAVID!!!
To see Taco Bell @ the Daytona 500 was great! To cheer David Gilliland on was fantastic! To see Taco Bell and Front Row Motorsports finish third was awesome! 
GREAT JOB DAVID GILLILAND AND FRONT ROW MOTORSPORTS!!! THE TACO BELL CAR HAD A GREAT DAY!!!!!!!!!!!
Did the David Gilliland site just tell everyone to post over here? 
Taco Bell car driven by David Gilland finished 3rd in the 2011 Daytona 500
I hope Taco Bell will step up with the sponsorship of David Gilliland now that he had a great showing with Taco Bell on the hood in the Daytona 500. 
Thanks for supporting David Gilliland & Front Row Motorsports for the Daytona 500! They did such a great job!
The only reason we go to Taco Bell is we want to support David Gilliland, driver of NASCAR's #38, Taco Bell car. After a 3rd place finish at the DAYTONA 500, you NEED to help Bob Jenkins fund this team!!!!! He is putting your logo on his car with his own money, that's NOT right..... Come on and help him out!!!!
I Hope that you decide to Sponsor the #38 FrontRow Motorsports Ford Fusion driven by David Gilliland, Full-time after he gave your Fast food chain a 3rd place finish in the DAYTONA 500.k
My mom wants u to make the tacos u had in summer!The grill ones with beef chicken or steak!!!
Hey Taco Bell! I feel that yall should give a little extra funding to David Gilliland and Bob Jenkins of Front Row Motorsports, so you can help them make up those 2 extra spots and put the #38 TACO BELL FORD in VICTORY LANE NEXT WEEK!
I'm sure David Gilliland helped sell some tacos today. Go David!!!
The "Chili Cheese Burrito" belongs in all Taco Bell joints. A radio station in my state made that happen in their city. They are hoping to influence the whole state. Submit to our demands now before protesters camp outside your place. Just a thought :)
Taco Bell !! never ate there before. Do you think they have tacos with only beef cause I won't eat it if it has anything else in it. 
Great to see David Gilliland running up front in the Taco Bell Ford yesterday at the Daytona 500!!!!
David Gilliland did a great job in the #34 Taco Bell car finishing 3rd yesterday!
<== is singing 4 times the steak
Taco Bell car finished 3rd in the Daytona 500??? Saw the car all day long on the tele-cast.Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!
just ate thier with my bff brittany trew
I reall miss the Cheesy Double Beef Burrito. I know the beefy crunch is the same thing with sour cream & Nasty frito chips, but i just want beef, cheese and rice. Is it too much too ask for? 
taco bell dog!

You guys rock. Your Crunchy Beef Burrito has become an instant favorite and staple in my diet. Please keep it around forever :)

I got a 7 layer burrito last night, but got 8 layers...I do not eat beef. I was not happy. Which saddens me, for I love the TB.

I want the quad steak jingle as a ringtone, you guys need to set that up for download on your website.
Taco bell is so coooool!
I don't remember clicking "like" on this, but it's okay. I do like Taco Bell in Americus, the food and the service are very good. The dining room is clean, too. The Taco Bell in Eufaula just closed; according to the Eufaula Tribune they lost their lease. Wonder why they didn't renew their lease? The food was bad, the service was slow and the dining area was always nasty. I ate there 2 or 3 times but finally gave up.
PLEASE bring back the Chili Cheese Burrito to ALL locations! It was one of the key reasons I loved your chain in my youth, and one reason why I sometimes go elsewhere now that I'm older. It's unreasonable that some locations here in the US still have them on the menu but not all.
taco bell for lunch!
Thank you for the free coupon, enjoyed it alot. Luv u Taco Bell.
I love your cheesy bean and rice burritos... and your crunchy tacos!
PLEASE OPEN A TACO BELL IN PERU !!!!!

Taco Bell, WHY U NO PUT NACHO CHEESE IN THE CHEESERITOS?
I am really disappointed...the free taco coupon on facebook does not exist. Is Taco bell really serious about customers ?
The limited sauce, the smaller sizes- Taco bell is seriously not paying attention.
I wish taco bell would bring back the chili cheese burritos for keeps! I lived off those thing til i was like 11!
<3 SPICY CHEESE CASADILLA'S 
The Quad Steak Burrito Rocks!!! I really miss the Cantina Tacos...except they should be made with tomatoes & cilantro instead of onions & cilantro... or you should be given a choice!!! It was a big fave of mine! Healthy and yummy! :)

I'm officially requesting that Taco Bell bring back some of their "Limited Time Only" items from the past. The Three Cheese Melt. The Texas Taco Sandwich. The Five Alarm Tacos. The Spicy Chicken Burrito. Hell, how about the Bell Beefer? C'mon, Taco Bell! McDonalds lets us have the McRib back every once and awhile. Why can't you?
I don't care what ANYONE says about TB .. beef, no beef ... who cares!!! at 3am after a gig with the Fifth Level Band, there is NOTHING like a 10 pack of crunchy Tacos!!!

I feel like my life is one big drunken trip to Taco Bell. Dear T-Bell, why dont you deliver? I would make getting my crunch wrap supreme at 2 am much easier.
the chicken quesadillas are the best! and the cinnamon twists. taco bell is the only fast food joint that i can get my wild cherry pepsi and i love it! it just gives me more of an excuse to go to taco bell besides their amazing food! :)
I love Taco Bell and I look forward to trying any new creations from the Taco Department

Taco bell is the best place 2 eat
I'm a Taco Bell addict..i need help...but i don't want help! (:
I love you, Taco Bell. And I just wanna say, I'm disappointed in everyone here still blabbering about the meat. It's real just shut up. And even IF it wasn't.... 1). I'm sure at least half of you ate TB for years and didn't even think about it. You only make a big deal now to get on the bandwagon. 2). Even if you didn't eat it before, why would you like the page?
thanks taco bell......i love your store yhess yhess ;; just had taco bell though
 Taco bell i dont know if i can ever keep away from you, i love your Cinnamon twists and your tacos I LOVE YOU!!!!!! 
Just got a double steak quesadilla it was pretty amazing XD

TACO BELL TACO BELL TACO BELL!!
88 cent Crunchwraps coming Sunday for one week only!
LIKE THIS IF YOU WORK FOR TACO BELL
FYI - do NOT eat at Taco Bell on McCain, NLR, AR! The Pepsi is 80% water, the food was barely warm, and it was TOTALLY bland!!! yech!!!!!
why are you guys so stingy with sauce? you should have a sauce hanging from the drive thru window so i can grab as much as i want. 3 packets isnt enough for all the food i have.
Had Taco Bell for dinner tonigh! The food was good...service not so good! Taco Bell, please reach out to the Mustang, OK store to teach them efficiency. 
So do you really put sand in your meat?
Bring Back the Bell Beefers. A lot of people want them again. It's good for business!!!!!!!!!!
Chickend soft tacos d best!!!!
Omg taco bell your tacos are like flying to heaven while eating!!!!! <3
88 cents for a Crunchwrap?!?!? Something this unheard of? Is it really happening?!? Sure is, but for one week only starting this Sunday! With REAL seasoned beef, nacho cheese sauce, sour cream, crispy lettuce, diced tomatoes, and a crispy tostada shell, all wrapped up and good to go; who could resist getting one for JUST 88 CENTS?!?!?
Went to Taco Bell Today, can't beleave they no longer offer taco sauce when you go through the drive through window or put some in with your order. No where on the drive through menu says you need to ask for hot sauce. Soon they will stop giving us napkins. Then they are going to charge us for napkins and taco sauce.
i wanna eat some taco bell right now
Taco Bell can you tell me the most popular food now?:) BTW: Cute dudes add me<3
Throw people for a flip, give them more hearty guacamole, sour cream, etc....you'll attract more
Who has two thumbs, braved the cold and ordered a number 6 beef supreme with a soft shell, mountain dew no ice and a side of nachos and cheese?..... THIS GUY!!!!

tacobell...in my house...i would die happy XD
i work at taco bell in dyersburg, tennessee and I freakin love it and everyone there...YEA BOI!!!!!!
Really Taco Bell, REALLY?? You have 3 items staring you in the face, but don't capitalize and re-release items trying to pretend they are new just adding a little extra meat. When you created your Apple Empanadas you should have came up with a Cinnamon swirl soft serve to compliment it before you got the Fruitista Freezes.While typing about this maybe you need to jump on the seasonal dessert train like around Spring(Easter) make one with a Coconut Cream filling. Entree/Non Dessert Empanadas. Mass produce these at your factory, and make them with ground pork, beef, or shredded chicken. Fill them with different items with it. Finally why have you not made Chimichangas? People love burritos, people love fried food and feel it's like comfort food. People love a nice crispy Chimichanga. It's not hard just jump.
Why are bean burritos so addicting??? Taco Bell Jones is a tough thing to shake off!-LOL!!
taco bell.... is the best... <3
yay! Rents bring home taco bell for lunch! lml! :)
Mmmmm Fiesta Salad for lunch!!! 
Bring back the original Fajitas from the 90s!!!!!

Just gotta say I am so in love with the Grilled Stuffd Steak Burrito with no beans and extra Baja sauce!! My all time favorite tho was your Steak Fajita wraps that u had like 10 years ago!! Why did u stop making them and will they possibly ever come back?!
Whos braving a cold Saturday Night for some warm, melty Fourthmeal goodness? #LateNight #Munchies http://www.tacobell.com/fourthmeal/
Me, Patrycia Foltyn, and Bianca Derango just walked for 45 minutes to get some of your delicious food. It was so good and warmed up our tummy!
Dear Taco Bell, I'm trying to tone my body. I'm not saying I'm a chubby person. I'm saying that I would like to not only be healthier, but look pretty damn good in a swimsuit. I've started running again and doing my night stretches and crunches. I'm trying to eat healthier. But my cheat food is your 5-layer Burrito with the Mild Sauce. I continue to do my exercise routine, I'm starting to see a leaner, meaner body that I want. And still sneak the occasional 5-layer burrito. I don't care how many calories there is in there. I have control to eat what I want and do my thing to still look damn fine. My point of this message? To tell you to continue rocking. You make my dieting a lot easier by treating myself to your place every once in a while. Your lover, Desiree Nunez P.S. One time, this chick starting making a scene this one location by my school. She started yelling at the manager too. The cops came, but I was a witness and defended your honor. DEFENDED IT. Also: Call me! <3
Hoy saci mi hambre con 4 burritos doble queso y uno de frijolitos... Mmmmmmmmm ya me dieron ganas de mas y mas y mas Taco Bell...

Taco bell is daah shxt.!!!
88 cent crunchwraps!
when are you guys going to bring back the chili cheese burrito?????
grilled taquitos with sour cream and guacamole are the best with some supree fries yum!
I think Taco Bell should stop being cheapskates and quit putting rice in their burritos to skimp on the meat. Trust me, you're not fooling anyone. MORE MEAT!!!!!!
you should put takis in the beanie crunch burrito istead of the frittos:)
Hey amigos oy cronsh rap suprim only 89 c taco bell contgamos con un exelente servisio y personas amables que te esperan con una gran sonrisa para servirte esos nachos bell grande con jalapenos. No faltes yo amo taco bell y tuuuuuuuuuuu

i love taco bell yum yum
You just made my day. 88 cents woo hoo! 
Just walked about a mile for a 5 Layer burrito and a Mtn. Dew. So worth it.
I THINK TACO BELL SHOULD DELIVER (:
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG Taco Bell, You are going to be the only thing I eat this week! 88cent crunch wrap supremes.... I'm in love........ <3
Autolyzed yeast extract is another name for MSG, isn't it? (Yes, it is-- I know because I am allergic to both and my body doesn't differentiate depending upon what you call it...)
Taco Bell should expand further north then Concord, NH. Everyone I know in Franklin, NH would go out of their way for Taco Bell, despite the 1 hour drive which is there and back. Making a Taco Bell in Franklin, NH would be a huge success, like how Amsterdam made pot legal for their town; Everyone loved it.
Really wish we would get another Taco Bell in Chillicothe, MO. I know we and a lot of others miss it.
taco bell ! im so happy you cleared up the meat thing . YALL MEAT IS REAL . ( :
I don't care if taco bell's meat is only like 1 percent actual meat, its so fricken good!:)
I love reading all these comments, so happy that because of stupidity, we get cheaper food. And it's a great way for them to gain more business because who wants just crunchwrap supremes?!? Maybe then we'll also buy a drink as well <3 My favorite thing to do is buy a two dollar chicken burrito meal with an extra chicken burrito with a 7 layer. I don't care if the food is bad for me, or if it is not real (which it is) it's so damn good!
I LOVE TACO BELL....
As a vegetarian, I was so happy to hear the rumor that your meat didn't have much meat. I went out and bought tacos. Would it be so hard to make delicious veggie meat-like crumbles with you spices? Really used to love TB meat. The non-meat options are not the same.
I get to make 88 Cent Crunchwraps!!!! COME GET EMM!!!! YUM YUM YUMMMM
why were the Chicken Ranchero soft tacos taken off the menu?
Just went to get the crunchwrap supreme and had to pay $2.49, they say it won't be 88 cents until after 5:00 =/
i <3 tacos esspecially from taco bell
taco bell is the best fast food in the world!

Just got charged $2.88 for a Crunchwrap Supreme #falseadvertising
taco bells meat is 35% real and the rest is bs they add so now i dont eat there
Taco Bell is the best drunk food
I wish there were more Taco Bell's in the area. I LOVE Taco bell...but I have to feed my craving while at work as too far from the house.

I love me some Taco Beezy!!!! :-D
Dear Taco Bell: Purple Shirt & I <3 Ma job *Thankzzzz**

BRING BACK GRANDE QUESIDILLA!!!!!
crunchwrap supreme + beans instead of meat (i'm vegetarian) = best thing in the world.
I am already sick of making the 88 cent crunchwraps BUT if it gets ppl to stfu about how "bad" our beef is ill gladly make millions more without complaining :)
Taco Bell Vs mcdonalds 
mmmm. Taco flavored kisses honey!!
Your Taco Bell Nascar car just got wrecked lol
Hey Taco Bell ~ Here's something that my girlfriend posted on her FB wall recently regarding Taco Bell - "it's pretty bad when you overhear the kid at taco bell say "this bitch wants baja sauce on everything but the taco" and you drive home crying over it." That's pretty bad. 
I TRIED to get the 88 cent crunch wraps, too bad nobody told the Taco Bell in Galax, Va. Ya'll SUCK!
like this if u agree tacobell is amazing!
On your website you say you have no MSG in your tacos but that is a lie by ommission. Autolyzed yeast extract contains MSG. Dishonesty is not the best policy.
Hahaha posted how I got sick, taco bell removed it. I understand why, but that's cheap. After previously eating taco bell many times, I had it one night after not eating for several hours and then eating nothing after, then got food poisoning.
I moved out to California last year and have ate at quite a few different TacoBells and have YET to find one that even comes CLOSE to the amazing customer service and quality food I'm used to getting at the Alpena Michigan location! I just wanted to let you guys know what an awesome job this location has done. 
Please bring back the chili cheese burrito to south east Michigan!
Is that 88 crunch wrap supreme at all tacobell's ???
88 cent my foot l0l what about the price after taxes
I would like 5 hard tacos, delivered to my house, asap, thank you
Please extend the new price for the crunchwrap supreme!
Please bring back the HUGE taco salad!
i want that cheesy chicken jalapeno wrap thingy. yummm.
I don't understand why people who hate Taco Bell has to comment on here. Like really, go away. K? K.
RVA DRUNKALOS WORSHIP KRUMM @ TACO BELL. BEAN IS THE BODY. BAJA BLAST IS THE BLOOD. 
 like this if u agree tacobell is amazing! 
I wonder where they get the hot fritos, im always sad cus they suddenly disappeared from the stores :'/!
I love your food. forget what others say. I dont eat beef at any other fastfood place. 
Just bought a Crunchwrap Supreme for 88 cents. It was priced at 88 cents in reference to 88% pure beef and 12% special ingredients. It would have been nice if they would have put at least some beef in my order. It was mostly lettuce.
taco bell!!!
Taco Bell and cheap beer are never a good combination,but I love the cheese wraps,good stuff!!
im danny d king taco bell+on-facebook
Dear Taco Bell, Thank you for making my favorite thing on your menu even more affordable. Signed Amanda's already giant butt. :)
You should totally start making fully loaded nachos again :D
I saw your commercial Taco Bell. Yeah you know, the one thats real professional looking and you dismiss the rumors of your low grade beef. That is why you all of a sudden you released your crunch wrap supreme for only 88 cents, Because your afraid of losing fan base. Why so paranoid Taco Bell?? I will still love you no matter how much your beef resembles dog food. Why don't you guys just admit that your food is eaten by a predominantly stoner percentage? its true. Thats why no one cared to complain about your beef because they were too high, and your food tastes so damn good. BTW you need allow Mtn Dew Baja Blast to be sold in stores just saying...
Just saw the ad after the Simpsons. I hadn't eaten TacoBell in years before this news story broke. Thanks for posting all the ingredients, and turning the doubts cast on your meat around into an honest listing of the 12% other ingredients. I like knowing what's in there. Oats for moisture...clever
I love u taco bell!u shuld make fish tacos!lmao gross
stay the course you beautiful bell, let the haters hate, just put on your h8tr blockers and let them deal with it
I just saw the commercial where Taco Bell addresses the issue with the recipe. Bravo, Taco Bell. You handled it well. Maybe people will leave you alone now.
I worked for Taco Bell when I was 16, that was a long time ago. I know they used real beef. I don't believe the story about them using meat with fillers. I love their new beefy crunchy burrito.
88 cent crunchwraps sound awesome! I miss the 99 cent chicken flatbreads though.
Just went to taco bell. Some good stuff man
I LOVE TACO BELL!!!! YUMMMMY!!!
Taco bell is Very GOOD!!!!!!!Don't you Think So
How awesome would ordering sound with auto-tune in the Taco Bell drive-thru?
Taco Bell is awesome!!!!
Taco Bell should do delivery!!! "Like" if you agree.
New Taco Bell Commercial! 80% Ground Beef, 12% Original Recipe.... What about the other 8%????
do u guys sell tacos?
ask me how many tacos i had today
taco bell needs to deliver!!!!
TACO BELL NEEDS TO DELIVER!!!!!! 
to all the haters of taco bell out there, talking about crappy meat, look at the meat in between those two buns of mcdouble in your hands, talk about 10% beef. just saying.
Went to taco bell in cullman, al today (2-27-11 @ around 5-6pm) and the douche bag guy working the drive through kept joking around like he couldn't hear my order. Almost went inside to 'make sure he heard me' but told him fuck this im going to arbys :o

I love Taco bell no matter what mess ups may happen or meat you may use or dumb people you hirer Taco bell will always forever be my Favorite place to eat !!!!
Dear Taco Bell, How many people would need to sign a petition for you to start delivery from your stores? I, along with many taco lovers, think delivery would be a fantastic service! 
is it just me or have the soft Taco's gotton ALOT smaller?
i love taco hell. most of the time they get it right, if not i call 1 800 taco-bell and i get a gift cert for what i spent plus.
Crunchwrap supreme needs to come in chicken
You have made my week; I'll be looking forward to my crunchwraps :)
i figured the t-bell near union square in NYC wasn't going to have the crunchwrap deal since half of the other stores in NYC don't abide by the general corporate promotions... i'm SO happy i was wrong...
I will get my .88 cent crunch wrap this week. Please bring back the Bell Beefer, I used to love them. They were a hamburger Roll with the meat, lettuce, cheese, just like a taco but with a roll. Or the bell beefer supreme. yum-o 
Juss ate an 88 cent crunchwrap supreme!! It was scrumptious!! Heheee!!
I really miss Taco Bell. Since my heart attack, I have been banned from Taco Bell. Will you be creating any heart-healthy recipes any time soon?
How is it that Centralia, WA taco bell doesn't honor the $.88 crunchwrap......Kinda bogus.
I would give up drinking if taco bell delivered
I LOVE YOU TACO BELL.
Apparently taco bell in farmington NM didnt get the $.88 crunchwrap memo. i just paid $2 and some change for one. drop out of school and wonder y u work in fast food
PLEASE-PLEASE BRING BACK THE BELL-BEEFER...even if it is for a short time...NEXT TO THE GRILLED STUFT BURRITO..BEST TWO THINGS EVER ON YOUR MENU--at least think about it OKAY?

I LOVE TACO BELL!!!!!

Taco Bell 018908 in Commerce, TX. . . Seemed conveniently unaware of the Crunchwrap special today. . .
Eating a delicious 88cent Crunchwrap Supreme and two crunchy tacos. Thank you for making my day on one hour of sleep a bit more bareable <3
Whoever sued Taco Bell has obviously never eaten there. Everything on the menu is delicious.
beefy cruch burrito is the best item they have.
Please, please, please open a branch in Cardiff UK!!!!!
i love tacos,but my only suggestion to the company is to put the cheese on top of the meat so it melts .not on top of the lettace. it should be meat ,cheese ,then lettace.and also a little more meat.
i just finished the second of my two crunch wraps :D tacobell you made my day... open one next door and we can be together forever.
My husband and I went to our local Taco Bell in Paris, Tn. When I asked about the crunchwrap, the girl at the register gave me an evil look then huffed as she rang it up. Then, even though it was 5 hours before closing they had no steak and when they had to cook some more, they started throwing stuff around in the back and complaining cause we wouldn't take chicken instead. Major attitude adjustments need to be made there.
ok ya stand behind ya meat why ya give so little? load them tacos dont need veggie tacos!
Were back with another deal like no other: Get a Crunchwrap Supreme for just 88! Now thats a supreme deal (pun intended)...

Taco bell beef is only 88% beef and 12% of I don't give a shit. I eat taco bell because it's cheap it fills me up and believe it or not I like the taste. I know it's not health food, but I don't care. Once a friend told me they actually used goat meat. To which I replied, "Not bahhhhhd." Viva las nachos! Long live Taco Bell!!! 
I work at the taco bell in Reading,PA n you dont need a cupon just ask for it. Its only 2 per customer tho
I LOVE THE NEW SAUCES! they should bottle them cuz i love them, way better than tabasco or chalula!

Motives strongly and frequently supports Taco Bell.
Yesterday I ate a chalupa and a crunchwrap supreme ! They were delicious the only thing that would've made it better was a mexican pizza but I ddnt wanna be fat !
i just can't quit you . 
Oh how I love those crunchwraps! ADDICTED. Nice promo!
Been going to Taco Bell since the 60's, it's always been "Fun food" and for the money it fits the bill going to the track.As far as this lawsuit, they can kiss my Chalupa. The beef thats in it, is beef, not cat....so get a life and quit wasting the courts time with such nonsense. Everything in moderation.....no one puts a gun to your head to live on fast food, it's food on the go for a quick refill. BTW you can order 2 instead of 10......
Went and had one for lunch 2day with my hunny it was very good ...thanx Taco Bell !
So hey listen, Taco Bell, you and I have been together for a while now. So long in fact that I made you my religion and my political views(check my info). I wish I knew how to quit you. Sinsiirrlay, Mark Edward Shelton II

Had my first bad experience at a Taco Bell. :( They told us we couldn't get anything that was fried or that had tomatoes or potatoes and had little beef. When we ordered what we could we were afraid of the quality of the product as the guy handing us the food looked angry at us.
LOVE UR FOOD ( just wish the price for the white sauce wasn't tht much )

I Just Ate Some Of You , Yummy (:
Taco Bell... 88% Beef... 100% DANK

Seen at Bugrun Sweden 2010
Fry! this fantastic bus we found a few years ago, a super original 1968 bay window microbus from Stockholm that had been tucked away at the back of a garage for most of his 40+ year life. Fry now lives in sunny California with Jerry Seinfeld.
This photo was taken around 4 years ago in May, Classic car magazine Sweden came over to do a photo shoot on Fry, around the same time that me and suz where expecting Travis to join us. I think Travis was born with in a week or so of these pictures.
Me suz and Cucumber What Else - our first born ; )
The cool thing with Bugrun, is that there is always a VW that pops up out of no where, and becomes the talk of the show. 2008 it was Jonny and his 23 Samba. like many I saw this bus for the first time between the pages of James Hale's Book "How to modify Volkswagen BUS suspension, Brakes and Chassis for high performance" around 2003 we photographed this same bus in its early guise when we first started out gathering photos for the Original VW Camper Cookbook, unfortunately that early fold never made it in the book. Anyone know who has it now? Last I heard it was heading to the UK.
The first video was a lot fun making. Filmed at VW show Bugrun in Sweden and at the first Camperjam in the UK.

Hi Kari, love the show.I will make the merange w/lemon curd this w/e. Any tips for a low cal white sauce to top red heart shaped cheese ravioli?
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: what's the (best) brand you used and would recommend? Thanks! Love your show a lot.. (",)
I have a question regarding the 'vermicelli egg noodles' that the Turkey Meatball Soup calls for. I found plain vermicelli (spaghetti type-no egg) and plain egg noddles..but couldn't find anything call vermcelli egg noddles. I even looked in the ethnic sections of the grocery stores. What exactly are they? 
Love the show you d a wonderful job of hosting always cheerful, interesting, and informative. The one thing that I truly like is the fact that the recipes are adaptive the fact that you can improvise and the dish still tastes as good as the original. Now my only pet peeve, I hate the thought of hair in my food and the sight of Kary's hair hanging loose over the dish she's preparing makes me cringe, if she could be a sweety and tie it back it would be nice . Keep up the good work 
Where can i purchase the gadget that you use when you scoop up the vegetables that you add to the recipes ?
Hi Kari, Can you make easy cinnamon buns on the show someday for us-your loyal fans? Take care and thanks for all of the great episodes! Love the show.
Good Morning! Coffee in hand, scrolling down the wall answering all the questions I missed while filming :)

Morning has started off on the right foot! Neighbour dropped off the cheesiest croissant! Happy Friday
kary how do u measure 2/3cup of butter or margarine. do u squish it down in your measuring cup?
...dinner was on the table with banana bread and ice cream for dessert. Although its Tuesday and I thought I would have had a few meals prepared for the week, Im glad everything turned out the way it did, we got to catch up with family, sat in our dinning room for the first time (been in the house for 1.5 years!!) and had an amazing family day dinner! Now what to make for dinner tonight :)
...I deglazed the pan with red wine, lifting up any bits from the pan and whisked in a few cups of beef stock. My original thought was to leave the gravy as is, with the soft strands of onion and roasted garlic cloves, but instead, took an immersion blender to make it silky smooth. It tasted like french onion soup gravy....delish! I invited my in-laws to stay for dinner at 4pm and by 6:30 pm,...
...Next, it was the gravy's turn - I used the same pan that I cooked the mushrooms in, incase there was any leftover flavour in the pan, I added the bed of onions, garlic and thyme that the roast cooked on, sprinkled in some flour and let it all cook for a minute until the flour started to darken and stick to the bottom of the pan...
...they were caramelized and cooked. I added a little red wine to deglaze the pan and borrowed some beef stock (meant for the gravy) for the mushrooms to drink up and finished them with little black pepper and parsley....man were they good! Once the roast was cooked and resting, the yorkshire pudding went into the oven - my mother-in-law is british, so I always get her to help with this part :)...
...Blanching/par-cooking my green beans makes life easier when the meal is almost complete - they just had to be sauteed in little butter and parsley. I wanted the mushrooms to really brown up, so I used a stainless steel pan. I sauteed them in a little oil and butter (so the butter didn't burn) and tried to leave them alone, only tossing them a few times until...
...Next, I seasoned a sirloin tip roast with kosher salt and pepper and as soon as the banana bread was done I cranked the oven to 450 to oven sear the roast for 30 minutes and then lowered the temperature till it cooked to medium. I had left over mashed potatoes from the shepherd's pie, so that was done, all that was left to do was blanch some green beans, make the yorkshire pudding batter and chop some mushrooms..
...I quickly popped the banana bread mixture that was in the fridge (meant for the middle of the week) into the oven, and got started on the roast beef dinner. I chopped some onions and peeled some garlic cloves and placed them into a baking dish, tossed them with a little oil and dried thyme - this was going to be the bed for my roast beef...
...so never having a self cleaning oven before, I decided to give it a try....didn't know that once I pressed that magic button, I would be locked out of my oven for several hours, forgoing the roast dinner. So plans changed quickly, shepherd's pie moved to Sunday night's dinner and it's a good thing because my in-laws dropped by yesterday, very last minute, and that meant surprise family dinner :)...
I spent this past Sunday cooking all day to get ahead for the week. Made a shepherds pie, banana bread batter, grilled chicken for salad's and sandwiches and was supposed to make a roast beef dinner for that night as well. I finished making the shepherd's pie and was about to get started on the roast beef dinner, but noticed my oven was dirty and smoking,...

I don't eat a lot of bread, but my husband and daughter love sandwiches, so I bought a bread machine to make sandwich bread for him that would be healthier than Health Nut bread from the store. I make really tasty bread in the machine, but have yet to find a 100% whole wheat bread that is light enough for my husband's sandwiches. Friends have given me recipes, but I either don't like added ingredients or it just did not work fro us. PLEASE, does anyone have a 100% whole grain bread that can be baked in a bread machine and can be used for sandwiches! I would be soooo grateful!
I was going to make the hearty beef chili from this week's simple meal plan, but I discovered I don't have a heart after all (please no jokes here...). I know it says to substitute more ground beef, but I do have a kidney, can I use that?
had deja vu tonight. Edible San Diego posted on FB tonight's special at restaurant Alchemy. grass fed burgers, local organic veggies, house cured pickles... plus parmesean frites. did you consult the chef? ;)
Thought you might get a laugh at this: Within minutes of finishing dinner, which featured pastured pork tenderloin grilled over mesquite, kale salad with walnut oil, crusty baguette with real butter, steamed peas topped with homemade mayo), my 4-year old foraged in the frig. and said, "Mom, can I have some salami? I ate all my pork." After our side convo on your grass fed burger post, thought you might be amused. Surely meat frequents our table!
hello jenny I love all the great information and recipes you give us so generously. I keep finding myself returning to your website to find the article you wrote about why fat (good fat) is so important to health (again and again I have to share it with incredulous friends). Can you direct me to it? I made a thorough search through the archives but couldn't find it, although I did find a lot of other great posts. Maybe the "food philosophy" section could list some of the major points (separate from sources and recipes). thank you! simone
I just discovered my Mother's beloved cinnamon pickle recipe uses packaged candy and red food coloring. Ack! Is there a natural cinnamon pickle recipe?
Curious if you've made quinoa flour, and how you deal with the saponin issue? I can see grinding anything else and then soaking it as flour, ie millet. But that seems like it wouldn't work for quinoa. Maybe soak, rinse, toast, and then grind? I don't want to reinvent the wheel if i don't have to!
Yep. Not everything in the Nourished Kitchen turns out every time. And a note of warning: don't forget about the butternut squash chips in your oven when you take a nice, long hot bath.
Just put your winter squash souffl in the oven. It is my first souflet... saying a prayer!
Jenny, your blog is as gorgeous as it is informative! Would you mind sharing what plugin you use to format your recipes? 
I just selected 'recipe box' on a recipe in your blog. Question: Where do I pull up these stored recipes. 
is raw butter supposed to taste cheesy? I just bought some organic pastures butter and it smells/tastes a little like parmesan. Its weird, and I dont think I like it! They are discontinuing their butter at my local store so I bought the last 4 containers... and now I think I might want to take them back. As someone who has never tasted raw butter though, Im not sure if maybe its SUPPOSED to be that way???
hey Jenny. Do you know if cabbage is an essential part of the 'cultured vegetable' process? I wanted to make some cultured daikon with ginger on its own, but I'm not sure it'll fermnet properly without the cabbage. Any insight?
What is the best oil to make mayonnaise??
Have you read Devil in the Milk? It is a fascinating book about the difference between goat's milk and cow's milk.
Hi guys! Are there any Canadian sources for things like fermented cod liver oil or real kefir grains etc that anyone knows of? I'm trying to find a way to access these foods without having to ship them from the US if I don't have too. (I'm Cdn..).
Looking to buy a used copy of the Nourishing Traditions and Gut and Psychology Syndrome (2010 New Edition)
I am a member of the nutrition committee for my child's school district. I want to create a parent group for information sharing, fund raising, and family nutrition education. Any ideas?
I made the Valentine's Day meal on your meal plan with the raw oysters. I made the mistake of telling my MIL, and she asked if I was trying to kill her son. She is a woman who doesn't understand sarcasm, so I think she was partly serious. This past weekend she learned that I am feeding my family raw milk as well. I am tired of defending myself to uneducated and fearful family members, so I said, "Why yes, yes I am." I loved the raw oysters, BTW, and was so happy that I tried them!
We're having pasture-raised pork chops on a bed of sauteed chard and apples. I love the foods of winter. What are your favorite winter dishes?
Hey does anyone know a good online source for coconuts? I bought one at my grocery store and it was moldy.. I don't think they really sell well where I live. 
It's a good day at the Nourished Kitchen: three things arrived in the mail today - a bucket of pastured lard, a side of fresh bacon and our mushroom growing kits.
Hi, i'm making a chicken stock from the Nourishing Traditions book and it says to skim the scum off the top while cooking and then to put in the fridge till the fat rises to the top and then skim that as well. I thought that we wanted all the fat and gel in the soup? Please help it's my first broth, thanks :)
So I made my first batch of beef bone broth last night.. and today it's going to become some beef stew. I was so surprised at how gorgeous it is, and it gelled perfectly! Just wanted to thank you guys for all the inspiration, you are helping my family get on the right track food wise <3

I have a question for healthy-eating traditional folks out there. Today we discovered a local farm that slaughters their own meat on site (beef, pork, chicken). I talked with them, and the animals are on pasture as much as possible but we live in Maine, so when snow is on the ground they get fed 50/50 mix of hay and silage. Is this okay? Not okay? 
Does anyone know where I should look for Juniper Berries? My local store not only has never heard of them, they wondered if I meant capers! :/
Help! Suggestions..please! for a HEALTHY meal, containing all the nutrients necessary, supporting a 16 year old male, veget., very active, who only can spend 10.oo $ a day for Food. ...Thank you.
hello there, a question for anyone. I have been soaking rice overnight and cooking it for up to two hours on a very slow burner. over the past 4 months our family has suffered from quite a few stomach virus', could it be the rice? has anyone had that problem? i am thinking cooking it too slowly could be the problem....?

Take a look at this review of the Weston A. Price Foundation conference in Philadelphia last November.
The Weston A. Price Foundation discusses the detriments of the newly released USDA dietary guidelines including greater restriction of saturated fats, cholesterol and full-fat milk. You'll also learn why these nutrients are critical to human health. It's a long video, but well worth it. 
The other day a friend walked into our home and, inhaling deeply, exclaimed, "Your house smells so good - like BUTTER!" What a lovely compliment for a real food lover like me. To find out why butter really is better, click below.
"Was the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now ... Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden as medicine, the potato as an article of food." Thomas Jefferson in "Notes on Virginia" 1784.
In this excerpt from a larger work, film makers discuss how the US occupation of Iraq has devastated the nation's agricultural infrastructure, made farming unaffordable and seed saving illegal due to patent law. As a result, what used to be a nearly 100% local economy is reliant on imported American and Australian agricultural commodities.
A Nourished Kitchen fan whips up another one of our dishes - this time it's curried butternut squash soup. Check it out! Have you blogged a dish from Nourished Kitchen? Let me know!

Love simple food? Try this super-simple puree of butternut squash, cinnamon and butter. It's wonderfully nourishing, easy to make and kids love this dish.
My favorite way to roast garlic - in a bed of fresh thyme and with a healthy dose of pastured lard. Lard, despite its bad rap, is a deeply nourishing and wholesome fat. It's one of the richest food sources of vitamin D, just behind cod liver oil and is primarily comprised of monounsaturated fat. A lovely food.
Naturally fermented beer can heal! This article takes a look how the ancient technique of brewing provided the ancient Nubians with an antibiotic-like tonic that could be used medicinally. Thanks to my Weston A. Price Foundation chapter leader for the share.
Always a fan of getting kids in the kitchen - I loved this post from Stacey of Foodkin as she prepares our yogurt & spelt crackers with her daughter. There's so much kids can learn in the kitchen - lessons that extend beyond the value of food. What lessons have your kids learned in the kitchen?
My go-to recipe for easy and satisfying breakfasts, this Dutch baby pancake recipe is just a little sweet and jeweled with chopped apple. It's super simple to make, and a different way to serve nutrient-dense eggs for breakfast.
A lot of real food lovers wonder how to use up Moroccan preserved lemons. Beyond chicken with lemon and olives, this allioli makes great use of fermented lemons, combining them with garlic, mint and olive oil. Plus, if you're allergic to eggs, it's a great substitute for mayonnaise.
Mayan chocolate truffles are chilling in the fridge. I can't wait to share this nourishing treat whose flavor positively resounds with cinnamon, orange, vanilla and a touch of chipotle pepper.
Here's my tried-and-true homemade ketchup recipe. Don't expect immediate gratification; rather, the gently and slow fermentation process helps the ketchup to develop a wonderful and complex flavor - producing a condiment that's rich in flavor and plentiful in vitamins, food enzymes and beneficial bacteria. Check out the recipe below. 
Molasses custard, an old-fashioned dessert, is one of our favorites on the slow and dark days of winter. It's easy to make, but serve it straight out of the oven to keep it from breaking.
Rendering duck fat, brewing kombucha and putting the final touches on our upcoming multimedia class on fermentation. What's on your Saturday to-do list?
French fries are a big hit with kids, but they can be loaded with nasty chemicals, and are often fried in unhealthy refined or hydrogenated vegetable oils. Never mind that when starchy foods combine with fat at high heat cancer-causing acrylamide forms. Learn how to make a healthy French fry in this quick video. Love it?

Now that the days are growing longer and brighter, if only a bit, the valley's hens are producing again and there's an abundance of eggs in our kitchen once more. I'll be making this fresh herb frittata. Did you know that pastured eggs have 3 times more vitamin E than conventional eggs?
Egg drop soup can be wonderfully flavorful and deeply nourishing. In this version we combine mineral-rich stock with aromatic vegetables like ginger, shallots and carrots for a soothing and revitalizing soup that's perfect when you're a bit under the weather.

Perfect for Sunday morning with a big mug of red tea and raw cream: Molasses Cranberry Cinnamon rolls are faintly sweet and rich in flavor.
Clam chowder is one of my favorite soups for a winter day. It's so rich, creamy and wonderfully salty. I can't wait to try this version by Food Renegade which offers a novel take on classic chowder with the inclusion of cumin and green chilies. Clams are among the most nutrient-dense foods available in the diet: extraordinarily rich in iron.

#1Hari1Kebaikan Mungkin kita sering mendengar bahwa kebahagian terbesar adalah ketika kita bisa memberikan arti dalam kehidupan seseorang. Dan, untuk membawa arti bagi orang lain tersebut, tidak melulu harus selalu yang besar dan muluk-muluk. Memberi arti bagi seseorang bisa berupa apa saja. Ya, apa saja! Terkadang hal- hal baik yang kita berikan atau kita lakukan bagi orang lain mungkin terlihat kecil, tapi bagi orang lain itu bisa sangat berarti. Oleh karena itu sebenarnya tidak ada alasan lagi bagi kita untuk tidak berbuat baik. Lets make this year a better year than before! Di tahun 2011 ini, maukah kita berkomitmen untuk menebar minimal 1 kebaikan setiap harinya? Apapun bentuknya. Jika bisa lebih banyak tentunya akan lebih baik. Tiada yang lebih manis dan indah daripada memetik buah atas kebaikan yang kamu lakukan. It will be a miracle for every good thing that youve done! Kamu bisa share #1Hari1Kebaikan kamu di FB / Twitter Wafer Tango setiap harinya, dan semoga apa yang kamu tuliskan tersebut juga bisa menjadi inspirasi bagi orang lain untuk melakukan hal serupa. Bukankah dunia ini akan menjadi lebih indah jika kita semua saling berbagi kebaikan setiap harinya? Lets make this world a better place! Kita bisa memulainya dengan melakukan kebaikan hari ini juga! Share #1Hari1Kebaikan di Facebook: * Tulis cerita kebaikan yang telah dilakukan di wall FB Wafer Tango dan sertakan tulisan #1Hari1Kebaikan di awal tulisan kamu. Semoga orang lain yang membacanya bisa terinspirasi dan mulai ikut serta juga dalam movement #1Hari1Kebaikan ini. Share #1Hari1Kebaikan di Twitter: * Tweet cerita kamu, gunakan hashtag #1Hari1Kebaikan di awal tweet kamu dan mention @WaferTango supaya bisa di-retweet, dan cerita kamu semoga bisa menjadi inspirasi juga bagi yang membacanya. Jadikan hidup yang cuma sekali ini agar lebih berarti dengan menjadi manusia yang bermanfaat bagi sesama. Sudahkah kamu berbuat baik hari ini? Mari suarakan tentang #1Hari1Kebaikan, bukan untuk bermegah diri namun agar dapat menjadi inspirasi bagi orang- orang di sekitarmu. Kebaikan dalam kata-kata menciptakan percaya diri. Kebaikan dalam berpikir menciptakan kebajikan. Kebaikan dalam memberi menciptakan cinta. ~Lao Tzu

" Forever Love" Dia adalah saudaraku. Dia adalah adikku satu-satunya. kita terlahir dari keluarga sederhana. mungkin karena kita hanya bersaudara 2, sehingga aku sangat menyayanginya. dia adalah segalanya bagiku, saudara yg baik dan penuh perhatian. kita tinggal jauh dari org tua, mungkin itu yg membuat kita lebih dekat dan mandiri. kalo aku sakit, pasti dia yg merawat dan menjagaku. makasih adikku sayang, aku akan tetap menyayangimu sampai kapanpun.
ForeverLOVE Aku dan sahabatku, adlah dua orang yang berbeda walaupun berbeda kami teteup akur2 aja, malah perbedaan itu yang buat kami makin kompak...contohnya aku suka tanggo vanilla ...dia suka yang coklat...ga ada masalah tuch...malah kami menikmati saat2 ITU ^^ minta comment positifnya temen2
"Ayah... Bunda... Ayo udahan dong fotonya, Habib uda mupeng pengen makan Tango nich...!?!" Kemanapun kita pergi, Tango Wafer Cookies&Cream selalu ada di dalam tas bunda Citra, tidak heran kalo waktu kita lagi take foto ini, Habib sampai mupeng2 gak sabar mau makan Tango-nya. "Sebentar ya nak... foto dulu biar dipilih ma dewan juri dari Tango"

This is WHY i buy Horizon Milk! Chocolate is DELICIOUS! I had forgotten what REAL milk was supposed to taste like... but instead of soy milk you should make HEMP milk (safer & healthier) http://bestmeal.info/food/rBST-rBGH-milk.shtml
New post, Spaghetti with Lemon and Olive Oil (al Limone): A tangled bowl of sunshine is exactly what the doctor ordered. 
New post: Pina Colada Cake, or how to sublimate a longing for sun, beaches, sand, and frozen umbrella-topped drinks into something more Monday-appropriate.
New post, Green Bean Salad with Fried Almonds (and also pickled red onions, fennel, celery and a ridiculously high addictive quotient) in which I cop to both my over-the-top green bean obsession and to fleeing the country in a matter of hours. Um, does anyone want to come help me pack?
New post, White and Dark Hearted Brownies: In which I get cute with you. I don't know what came over me. There was a pan of white chocolate brownies and a pan of dark chocolate brownies and a tiny cookie cutter and then there was some belly-swapping and now I'm sure you're all rolling your eyes. But you could be rolling your eyes while eating brownies instead, so get on that.
New post, Blood Orange Olive Oil Cake: A cake that started perfect, and proceeded to get more delicious each day it hung around. Well, until day 5 or so. I have no idea what happens after day 5 and suspect you won't find out either.
New post, Meatball Subs with Caramelized Onions and Gruyere. Starring pillowy, fork tender, flavorful meatballs; buttery caramelized onions, melted gruyere, a toasty bun and, well, you. Because who doesn't love the person who makes this for them?
Just in time for Valentines, I created a recipe for Bon Appetit for the occasion -- Heart-Stuffed Shells in a Ricotta Sauce (Artichoke Heart Stuffed Shells in a Lemony Ricotta Bechamel, to be wordy). I am an artichoke fanatic and these exceeded our highest expectations. If you think stuffed shells are boring, just cheese, cheese and more cheese, I hope these will surprise you.

Did you know? Hunger is a serious threat facing over 5 million seniors (11.4%) in the United States. MOWSF delivers warm nutritious meals to over 1,700 homebound hungry seniors in San Francisco every day.
Penny wise and pound foolish. Discharge practices and lack of support are a major issue for seniors who live alone or even for those who have some support. It's good to see that there's an effort to look at the issue more broadly than just reducing days of hospitalization.
Happy Valentine's Day! How will you spend the day with your loved ones?

Meet Anne Bassin, another key member of the MK Fashion Week dream team. Anne has worked with Michael on over 30 shows in the last 15 years, ensuring every production runs as smoothly as the one before. From determining the infamous seating chart to dressing the hottest celebs in head-to-toe MK, Anne oversees the brand's creative execution on every level (including this pic, which she opted to take herself). "He always challenges me to be better, more creative and to try harder, but always with the greatest sense of humor," says Bassin. "It's like I've been at a comedy club everyday."

Tim DiSalvo can recall meeting Michael at the FIT dorms like it was yesterday. "We couldn't have looked more different, I was this small-town Pennsylvania boy in hiking boots and Michael was dressed in designer jeans and carried the chicest accessories. He looked like Peter Frampton," says DiSalvo. But the two clearly hit it off, and 30 years later the best friends are fortunate enough to work together. DiSalvo heads up menswear design for the brand and couldn't be happier working with his closest friend on a daily basis. "I am just proud to contribute something to his growing empire. I am Michael's biggest fan."
Megan Wall knows a lot about working with Michael. The senior designer for Women's Collection started her tenure at the brand when she was still an intern at Parson's The New School for Design. Six-and-a-half years later, Wall has been an intricate part of the show process, helping create the immaculate looks that walk the runway, and perfecting every last piece in the weeks leading up to their debut. "What strikes me about working with Michael is how much knowledge he has about all aspects of design," says Wall. "His positive energy and sense of humor seem to always inspire those around him. It amazes me how much I have learned from one man over the years."
Like so many, Magda Farkas makes her way to New York each and every Fashion Week. As Michael's head tailor, she has worked on his runway collections for the last 30 years, so not even moving back to her native home of Hungary could keep her away. "It's been a thrill seeing how his work has evolved," Farkas says. "Just ...when I think Michael couldn't get any better, he does. Every collection keeps getting better." The feeling is more than mutual. "She's the best," says Kors. "Celebrating her birthday during showtime is always a highlight. She is real family!!"
Just opened my valentine present - I LOVE MY MK WATCH!!!! 
My dad got me a Michael Kors bag and sunglasses - LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Matches my Michael Kors watch!!! <3 Never to old to be a daddy girl on Valentines day!!
Michael Happy Valentine's day ! Love, love. Love and much more. Kiss & Hugs

Richard Sinnott remembers meeting Michael for the first time backstage after a show. Sinnott was then accessories director at Harper's Bazaar. "He was so funny, and nice. I remember thinking, this is so refreshing," says Sinnott. It wasn't long before Richard joined the accessories team at Michael Kors, where he now heads up the design for all categories, from watches to shoes to bags. It's been over 11 years, and Richard still appreciates the refreshing, familial atmosphere within the brand. "Michael is so funny and smart and it's amazing how much I have learned from him over the years."

b'How do you go two work for nomac drilling com\r\n'
b"Wouldn't it be nice if Chesapeake brought the Big Blue to Mardi Gras, in Shreveport,LA \nSupport the nice people of Shreveport's Haynesville Shale. I would be glad to help get this going."
b'SO!.....JUST CURIOUS....WHEN CAN ROYALTY OWNERS EXPECT THEIR CHECKS THAT WERE DUE FOR DIRECT DEPOSIT ON FEB 1 ?????? Hmmmm???'
b'Any news as to who will be buying your assets in the Fayetteville Shale?'
b'I never got a response as to who the contacts at Chesapeake would be for the purchase of fresh water to frac and drill with in the Eagle Ford Shale near the Pearsall Tx area. Any contacts, phone numbers, email addys and names would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!'
b'We jave mineral rights in Washita County Oklahoma (35-11-16) . A well was just finished about a mile west of us. We are really anxious for a well on our section. I think Chesapeake usually waits to drill until the lease is about to run out. Is this correct?'
b"They've got a great sweeps on their web site-and helping with natural gas (providing another avenue other that oil) helps all of us in the long run!"
b'Considering to Buy some chk stock but rirst a question Did i read where you sold a large amount of shale to china???????????????????'
b'Chesapeake says what they mean and means what they say. My husband and I have had a great experience during the leasing process. They answered all of our questions were patient with us while we went to our lawyer (3 times) and payed us in a timely manner(every cent). You guys are great. Now get drilling! P.S. I know you will ask, Marcellus/Utica area.'
b'Chesapeake needs to recognize their shareholders as well as their employees. We too believe in you! '
b'Just wondering if CHK is planning on fixing roads in Rome Township. Towner Hill Rd. and Robinson road are a complete disaster due to all the water and dump trucks traveling these roads. I live on Towner Hill right next to the Towner well pad. '
b'Hey guys, Do you know when you will be drilling in the West finley Twp area? I did see a chspk rig currently drilling on laidley run rd in WV and it has got my attention. Thanks!'
b'just wanted to let the world know how sorry this company really is.... they only look out for the big shots in the office.. they have no concerns for the men who make their job possible... my husband has worked for them now going on 5yrs.. he was hurt on job and had to take medical leave for surgery.. he was released last month by the work comp dr. who had only saw him one time jan 14.. the surgal dr did not release him until feb.14. in doing so had no idea the type of work my husband did.. when he went for his fit for duty he had trouble pickin up a hundred pound weight from a squat they said his leg shook a little bit after only 8weeks after surgery.. so in doing so they decided to FIRE him.. and all they are worried about is him returning his uniforms..I hope no one else get hurt on one of chesapeakes sites.. wonder if they will try to make this right.. will keep all posted..'
b'"We seriously undervalue the passion\xe2\x80\xa6a person brings to an enterprise. You can rent a brain, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t rent a heart." -Mark McCormack #CHKquotes'
b'Just wanted to say that I think chesapeake is a good company because when my dad got sick with cancer theylet him work when he could. That is a good company. '
b'Just wanted to say thank you to Chesapeake for everything that they did for my family when my Daddy passed away! He was so proud to work for Chesapeake and loved every second of working for them!! Chesapeake went above and beyond any expectations! Thank you! Daddy worked out of the Fort Worth, Texas office.'

b'"The world is full of willing people; some willing to work, the rest willing to let them." -Robert Frost #CHKquotes'
b'"Failing to prepare is preparing to fail." -John Wooden #CHKquotes'
b"Please read this through as this is not meant to bash CHK. Understandably, Chesapeake needs to look out for their corporate intrerests and shareholder returns, BUT the recent partnerships and sales to BHP and CNOOC have me puzzled. Why in the world wouldn't the US Gov't see the increased foreign interest and subsequent exportation of our abundant NG resource, and utilize it for United States? OPEC and special interest groups can't overwhelm the politicians enough to forego the needs and benefits to our citizens...can they?\r\n\nWe're probably heading to $4 gasoline by summer....now's the time to make the change! I'll be more than happy to see Trout Run, PA turn in to the Dubai of the western world!"
b'"The most damaging phrase in the language is, \'We\'ve always done it this way.\'" -Grace Hopper #CHKquotes'
b'Chesapeake Energy sponsored the annual API Chili Cookoff in Casper, Wyoming this month. The CHK crew, including Charles Ohlson, Dave Wittman and Leonard Berry, led the charge by cooking a delicious traditional red chili.'

PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE Basic Cooking, Week 4 serves 8 Topping: 2 ounces unsalted butter 3/4 cup brown sugar 6-8 pineapple slices, core removed Batter: 4 ounces unsalted butter, softened 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla 2 eggs, separated 1 1/2 cups flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup whole milk 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Melt the butter over low heat, stirring in the brown sugar till it dissolves. Cool. Pour into the bottom of a 9 inch cake pan or skillet. Cut and arrange the pineapple slices over the brown sugar mixture, covering the bottom completely. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Cream the butter with the sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and beat in the yolks one at a time, scraping the bowl after each addition. Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk. Whisk the egg whites with the cream of tartar until the are stiff enough to hold a slight shape. Fold the whites into the batter a third at a time. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly over the pineapple. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until the top is browned and the cake pulls away slightly from the pan. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Turn it out onto a cake plate. Serve with a lightly sweetened whipped cream.
is it true that Aarti, from Aarti Party went here, I went about 3 years ago so looks like we would have been there around the same time. Laura was a great teacher!
Your new website is deliciously wonderful!! Awesome job!! Can't wait to start the Pro Baking class in just a few short weeks!
Director Anne Smith will be talking soup on the Market Report on KCRW Saturday at just about 10:00 a.m. You can listen live on the radio or at http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/gf
My attempt at Chocolate Pavlova. This was a delicious dessert.
Tas teams at hobart
the two salmon dishes Ali and Esther cooked
The Salmon was beautiful Ali and Esther made this one...
25 minutes....YIP!!!
Do you guys watch Come Dine with Me Australia or just loyal to MKR? lol
Oh no everyone is expecting ROASTED DUCK in spring roll!!!! 
Poor Kane and Lee better luck next time with their cooking, will their salmon turn it around? Come on Guys! 
go the sandgroppers and the banana benders
What the with the Red bean soup????
Not liking the tassie couple or should I say the female side of it ..really she shouldnt be so harsh considering she hasnt cooked yet...cmon you south aussie's although my faves are the 2 boys from queensland at the moment...and Luv you manu :)) HEE HEE 
i have a feeling that no one is liking the tassies at all... or atleast the female side? agreed or not?
Can't wait to see what Tasmania has to offer. She certainly has attitude and "I don't like it"... even though the Vics started off a bit shakey it was great to see that they were able to pic up points for their mains.
Was Kane's Bow Tie a tad dated ? Snooker Comp Attire ?? LOL Sorry Kane but I had to call it. Remarked on Rowan's red bow tie last year and ended up having to apologise to his father who challenged me!! It was and Is only meant in good humour !
Cool show, and Matt hot as ever notice that tassie beak. Awesome show lice the pressure that it crests just the way the kitchen should b
Dear Daniela & Stefania: how many times do you intend to proclaim "we're Italian!"? Get over it. Dear other teams: beat the shameless duo!
Will Sammy & Bella's grandmother's recipe help them top the leaderboard tonight? Find out in a few minutes when My Kitchen Rules starts! (**Those in regions where regular programming has been pre-empted for extended news coverage, we will notify you of new schedule times for MKR episode 3 as soon as possible**)
Oh shush fatties. Suck it up Victoria! Jealous talking!!! Hahaha
I'm all for Bella and Sammy! Why is everyone else so rude! and where can I find the beetroot soup recipe???
Lovely girls, lovely meal. Love the SA couple, they are encouraging and fair also the WA couple, nice where as the others are full of attitude and whingers..... 
my heart goes out to QUEENLANDS and i hope everyone one is doing ok... m k r should be broadcasting soon for you guys i hope hugs 
We finally get a Tassie team and we get lumped with these two, sigh! hoping they fail, badly.
Well done Sammy and Bella...but why oh why did they not soften the cream cheese before whipping it??? lol Anyone who's ever made a cheesecake or jelly slice knows that...nerves and rushing maybe! Bet they thought about it in hindsight where ALL our vision is 20/20! Still the soup looked awesome and I loved Lee and Kane tonight..much more relaxed! Well done again!!
Just watched the show. WOO HOO....well done Sammy and Bella!! Lovely girls and what fantastic food. I so want to try that soup...my mouth was watering. Kane and Tassie wife are a right pair of whinging bitches!! Can't wait for Tassie's turn...want to see what she is like preparing her food!! 
Woo hoo, well done girls, i never thought that i would like beetroot soup, but are now dying to try it.All you dishes looked great and i don't know why everyone complained about the serving size as that is what they are like if you eat at a fine restaurant. Keep up the good work..
when will the nsw team from wednesday 2nd february 2011 eposide air in brisbane
Congrats to the Polish 2 - they are genuine real emotion there. I can't wait to tryout the beetroot soup for dinner tonight. Everyone seems lovely and genuine except for the obvious terrible Tas 2. Just booked a holiday last week to Tasmania for a holiday, hope i don't run them, lol. TV or not no matter how the producer does it you can easily detect falseness. She is so mouthy and smirky. Great show.
Amazing score of 10/10 for Bella and Sammy! Go girls! Just printed out the recipe for Beetroot soup with wild mushroom parcels to try it. Sounds spectacular. :) Love MKR. <3
when is the nsw team air in brisbane as it was not on last night
Just great = Tassie weren't in the show last year and I can't believe out of all the nice lovely people that live in Tassie, they had to pick them - she certainly is a b***h! Can't wait to see how she goes!
I just watched the QLD boys. So proud of them! No bitching, not too much stressing and they kept their sense of humours right through! Haven't seen any other episodes of this season yet but already proud to be a QLDer! 
Congratulations to the NSW Team, the beetroot soup is nearly the same as I make for christmas eve. There should be more of Polish cooking on the TV. Polish torts as better than zumas cakes.
The beetroot soup looked oily
Tasmanians have been BEGGING MKR to include their own....i bet they're feeling a little embarrassed with MKR's choice right now...
My question is you have teams from Tasman, SA, Vic, NSW, WA & QLD. Isn't NT part of Australia? It just seems to me that everything revolve around the rest of Australia and Northern Territory (Darwin) doesn't exists. 
can i someone post the recipee for the pear desert
cant wat to see the tassie team cook they think there so good hope they fall on there ass they think there so good lets see
was just on the official website for my kitchen rules trying to find Eposide 3 which because of the cyclone updates was not aired on Wednesday night as planned.............it says it will not be available till after 9pm Friday night after the eposide is airred in qld for veiwers but after looking around the site was extremely dissappointed to see a scoreboard with NSW cookers on top of the board which is the episode that is still be aired ................now i have no need to watch it 
Wow, first time I have been here and just reading all these comments about the show. I think the only thing negative about MKR is the comments made by most of you guys. Your judging people you dont even know, I like all the teams they where picked for a reason and all have something to give to the show-YES it is a show- Go the Vic's I think you are great xxx
Love this show!! They're all winners...just for getting up and giving it a shot!! Good luck to ALL the teams :)
S.A cooking Next. Hope they do well. Love all the teams this year.
Hope SA do well..Interesting teams this year
Hey whats going on? better homes and gardens just came on instead of mkr??? 
I hope the Tassie team bomb out, they are so negative. I am a Tassie girl, raised in Qld but I am cheering for the South Australians, they seem to be the most genuine of all the teams.
far out, dont you just love how bitchie everybody is until it is there turn to cook, those people from Melbourne , should just be a little bit quiet
How did the SA couple go as I missed the show and the scores are not on the leader board?
Sydney all the way ! Go Polish girls -what a brilliant menu and sophisticated rustic Polish modern and traditional cuisine -My Irish husband agrees Beetroot Soup with Mushroom Parcels is the best in WWW. Good luck.
Looking forward to Monday's ep : COME ON SA !!!!! we have the best food and wine here, let's see some yummy food on the plate !!!!
Soup plus ice cream???
To the Tasmanian and Victorian Team, you guys should be a lot nicer to the other contestants, you guys arent doing so hot in the kitchen yourselves! Wish the public could vote, im sure you guys would be the first to go. Go NSW, you girls ROCK....
 but i am sure you all have your opinons on shit too ... their is just on the food they are eating makes the showd interesting to watch... we can all be bitchy you know :) how would you feel if you were reading this and and it said ppl hated you .... image then when there read this shit you guys post about them how rude......... GO NSW AND SA AND WA AND QLD AND VIC AND TAS make australia proud no matter where you are from in the country we are all still AUSSIES :) good luck for tonight SA
God i hope that snooty Tassie couple get their just desserts! She is not makin any friend in my house!! 
The "TASSIE LADY" Makes My Kitchen Rules a pretty un happy buzzed competition, come on Tassies give your opinions a break and just enjoy the competition. You are a fussie tassie eater lady. Hmm bring to air Tassie on Tuesday.
If Mel (from Tassie) doesnt shut her cake hole, i'll shut it for her!..
I am ashamed to share the same name as that tassie pasture cow!! Pull your head in - karma's coming to you :)
........FOOD FIGHT..........
Does that horrible woman with the what appears to be a hen pecked husband ever say anything nice 
Oh James open your mouth and tell her............................we know you want too!!!!
OMG I thought last years SA team had a bitch on it, but this Tassie Viper takes the cake. You don't have to be a rude bitch to get your point across. Learn some manners. Wonder how many friends will be inviting her to dinner now or have and now think never again.
Lol ... what is wrong with Melanie??? OMG - she hasn't had one positive thing to say about tonight's menu! How can you not taste mango?
I don't believe it James spoke !!!!!!! 
Lets just see how the pretenders from tassie go when its their turn. I don't think either of them has had anything positive to say about any of the meals they have been presented with.
The Tassie bicthes have to do a bloody good job when they are on ... otherwise they just made a fool of themselves... especially this bad mouth.. melanie... such a cow...
Grrr melaine no one cares what u think! Stop making us tassie's look like bad sports! My advice would b to shut up until you've had your turn! 
melanie is a right old cow !!! cant wait to see her sweat when she cooks ! im suprised no one esp the judges sprung the olive oil in the chocolate !
Grrr melaine no one cares what u think! Stop making us tassie's look like bad sports! My advice would b to shut up until you've had your turn! 
Ok I am from Tassie but can someone pls shut Mel up, what a cow. You got me off side already, go the butchers!!!!, well until our female cops are on at least (hope they are better)
Grrr melaine no one cares what u think! Stop making us tassie's look like bad sports! My advice would b to shut up until you've had your turn! 
Im ashamed to admit im from tassie when we have people like Melanie and James representing our state
the Tassie woman is being portrayed as a nasty, catty sort of woman.... is that who she really is??? or is it the producers simply adding some tension?
PS.... I love Tasmania and the gorgeous Tasmanian people... she's just a tool all states have them... :) 
I will miss tomorrow's episode! Damn, I was looking forward to the TASsies getting their just desserts...lucky I have Facebook & Twitter comments to read until Sunday's repeat! 
i actually liked the tassie team...but that tassie woman does my head in. James is very quiet tho and doesnt say much..maybe they might still come good
as someone whos in the restaurant hospitality industry and who loves seafood yes with tuna its sear 1 side sear the other sear the edges and serve
Not sure why Tassie girls get upset when the word inbred and husband/brother is used. I was just commenting on a girl and guy who look related (by blood) and say they're married???
How funny was tonights show, Peter,i love the eye rolling and the face pulling, some people just seem never to be happy,lets pick at every meal.I hope that their meals tomorrow night are of competition standards.I thought this was a home cooking comp not a five star restaurant comp.We'll see how it all pans out tomorrow night, i think the knives will be out.
i live in tassie its a shame that mel has her head far up her ass and bags all the rest not they way most of us act down here....
Mel & James you are a poor represenation of a friendly Tasmanian...and why on earth would you cook prawns??? We have some of the greatest seafood in the world and you choose something that doesnt reflect Tasmania. Sour....hope you choke on it :)
this might sound a bit hipagridcal from my prev status on here.... but where do tassies get off beging rude on tonights SA meals dam i hope you dishes go down in flames ...... still aussie pride
You're not perfect, always correct and know things better than other people eventhough you think you're all that. You are worse critics than the judges. Mel n James, I hope you lose! I wonder if they eat vegemite or is it too simple to be put on sandwiches?
How the hell did Mel and James end up representing Tasmania? Surely there are plenty of other, nicer, less spiteful and way more talented couples there were to pick from!!
Well done Donna and Reade Go South Aussie..in fact I am liking ALL the states..except Tas of course..Melanie heres a tip..I think you need to cook an Egg dish cos if its not on the plate it will end up on your face!!!!!! Hope you score Well below everyone else...so dont sweat it please the vic couple..:)) and luv you manu and pete xo
i'm seriously cracking up. For all those last yr that hated paul and mel they had nothing on this sour faced, rude and judgemental, and unhappy person.. Not a nice word to say.. Not the best pers for tarrie.. Husband is very quiet and agreeds with her.. Whipped much' they may be lovely people just not coming across that way :) 
Mel is a bitch n her ptr just sits quiet how does he put up with her? I can't wait to c how many bitchy remarks she gets tmw!! 
It will be interesting in watching the Mel and James cook... They had better be the best in this competition.... But I will be very surprised....
No wonder shes been recently married. Who would want to marry that cow melanie can u imagine how she is at home u can tell who wears the pants in that relationship. Hope u f... Up 2morrow nite 
god, what the hell is up with this tassy btch!.....saying S.A.'s meals were just above average...? im sure their cooking was 500x better than urs...and hey, at least they didnt get whacked with the ugly stick, mel!!!!
i hope the tazzie bitch crashes and burns tomorrow night, nuthin but negative comments from her, really offputting. i thought SA done really well and here someone like her open her mouth like she has a michelin star...pfft!!!!! 
I wonder if Mel is really that stupid or is the show telling her to act that way, she hasn't got a clue poor thing,and Kane and lee are just scared that's it for them,oh well every show has a villain congrates Mel .put her back in the box James until she learns how to play fair.
just saw the shorts of tomorrow night, gota love it. NOTHING goes right for the biatch hehe karma is so great.
as with lots of comments below - i also hope the Tassie Bitch crashes and burns - what a nasty piece of goods - would be nice if the public could put in votes, she would lose big time
The food tonight looked awesome (except raw fish - I can't handle that) - HOPE THE TASSIE LADY COMES UNSTUCK!!!!!
Mel is a snobby arrogant bitch im embarressed to say they are representing us tassie people !! Lets hope that the other tassie team is nothing like Mel and James!!!! im going for one of the other states !! maybe the two greek ladies they seem really nice :o)
What goes around comes around........looking forward to tomorrow night's episode - attitude and nasty snide comments are not necessary - and what is wrong with those Melbournians - they had the same opportunity as every other competitor, got it wrong and now cannot score objectively! Agree his tuna was overcooked - but do they forget that just about nobody liked the red bean muck they called dessert? Scoring a 5 tonight was just pure bad sportsmanship and he should know better being a tennis umpire.
excuse me Mel, but seriously, indulge in a little more tact and friendliness ... who knows, it just might do you some good. Oh, and by the way, your hair cut & styling is a little "below average" and so too is the way you treat others, including your partner. And one more thing ... please try smiling, it will do wonders for your face, and those pre-mature frown wrinkles.
Hey guys you can also write comments on melanie and james page on the offical website that would give em a real wake up call .
Hope Gonzo from Tassie cooks a crepe that bursts into flames and burns her titties...better if she cooked James balls....except he has none!! 
Congrats South Australia .Just loved the look of that desert. Yum. What a great relationship they have. nice..
i want that recipe for the mushroom starter tonight it looked awesome... well done guys you did a great job.
all i can say is, out of everyone so far, tonights people were the calmest, the 2nd calmest were nsw, melbourne and qld were all fidgety and worried compared to how the teams act when there eating the food
 I love all the positve people on MKR then there is Melanie, where does she get off telling the SA team that the food was "average" and "not a restaurant dish?" well Mel on the highlights for the next episode your prawn dish just looked like a salad with prawns in it???????????? Go figure, a restaurant dish? more like a "Sunday night dish with the family" all your words of course.....
i looove the SA team (not that im from SA) ... they have been so nice to everyone - very likeable couple indeed and i love what they served tonight - despite what other people had said (someone named Mel) ... good on yah Chandler's Grill ... cant wait to see if mel's can walk the walk and talk her talk .... huh!
The SA couple Donna & Reade - How cool, calm & composed were you guys tonight in the kitchen? Food looked great & I would wine, dine & party at Chandlers Grill anyday! As for your score tonight, well deserving. Last but not least - loved the song.
ok, so I did a bit of searching on James and Mel - and this is what they had to say for themselves: Melanie, 37, was married for 12 years to a chef who dominated their kitchen. "I didn't cook at all during that time," she says. "He just did it all. When we split up, I had to start cooking for myself and my two children. I found that not only could I cook, but I was pretty good at it too. "When I was married I only had four dishes to my name. Now I have hundreds and I realise what fun I missed out on." YOU SEE MKR FACEBOOK FRIENDS, THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO CRITIC WHEN MEL HAD NOT COOKED FOR 12 YEARS AND COULD ONLY COOK 4 DISHES, AND JAMES WAS IN LOVE WITH THE DEEP FRYER!!!!!!!!!!!!
James, a 36-year-old jazz musician, was a notoriously bad eater. Tomato sauce on pasta was about as extravagant as he got. "I'd never had an interest in food until I met Melanie," he says. "I was like, 'Can you deep fry that?' Being a musician, a lot of the eating I did was between one and three in the morning." 
I actually think that Mel from Tassie has NO TASTE BUDS - she's not tasting what everyone else is tasting and most of her criticisms are the same as the judges - mushroom undercooked and balsamic too sweet - that's exactly what Pete said. How can everyone else taste MANGO and she says it tastes like NOTHING .... what the? Lets see how she handles cooking for 12 in competition conditions ..... 
i hope they finish dead last love to see that and i never wish bad karma but i might make a expection as chef this sort of customer is the one you want to slap in the face with her blue steak
Well done Donna and Reade, cooking for 12 cant be easy but cooking for 3 judges must be tough. Its a wonder Manu and Pete are allowed to judge with Mrs. K. Nowitall there putting her 2 bits in. Great job with the chocolate cases Donna !
Donna & Reade, well done. You show great passion for what you do!!! Would love to nhave a meal at your place and congratu;ations on the chocolate cases!!!!! To bad it's your turn tomorrow Tassie critic!!! 
If James is a typical Tassie fellow...then those men on the apple isle clearly need lessons in how to avoid becoming manbags!! Poor, poor James, devoiced by the witch as soon as he's hitched :(
That Tassie Lady is a nasty piece of work. Ever since this new series has started, I've found her to be extremely negative in her attitude. I understand it's a competition but I don't believe she's said anything really positive about any of the dishes that have been served. Does she not realise this isn't masterchef, yes it is a competition but these people aren't world class chefs. They're just ordinary people who enjoy cooking. Maybe she should be on Masterchef come to think of it. Clearly she thinks she's the shit over everyone else. "Personally, I wouldn't serve that" (snotty look) "That's not a competition dish (snotty look) "Pretty Average" (Snotty look) YES Honey, We get it, You're a mean bitch.. I just hope you know you've pissed the majority of the nation hating on you, and we all can't wait to 'critique' your world class cooking skills tomorrow... What's that smell Tassie? Is it FAILURE?!
Last night Mel said that she couldn't even taste the mango in the dessert when clearly it was on the plate in front of her, her problem is then, that she has no palette.No wonder she can't taste the goodness in the food, i hope that she is tasting her dishes before she serves them up tonight.
You apply to go on this show, you put your life and family on hold - you are playing for $100,000 - you would NOT be acting - you would be trying to win. Mouthy Mel and Just James are what you see. They are making fools of themselves and their families.
oh mel doesn't know wat mango is!!!! Hahaha... Find is very funny esp wen fresh mango is served n how can anyone not taste it.. Hope it ia a total disaster tonight... 
I love Donna and Reade!!! But, I can't understand why both Peter and Manu both scored last night's dessert a 7. Peter said he didn't like the chocolate cup (too many flavours) but Manu couldn't fault the dessert - how can they both score the same - I smell score fixing. Also at teh same meal - Kane and Lee - Kane had one not so good course (Kane's tuna being over-cooked) in the whole meal - why then did their hosts deserve a score of just 5 out of 10??? Stupid strategy playing me thinks ... 
I think everyone should realise that Mel has been edited to look like a bitch - there must have been some times when she was complimentary ... poor girl, this will be a steep learning curve for her. 
Will be interesting to see what "competition standard" food Tasmania serves up tonight. "Humble Pie" on the menu, perhaps???
Well as a Tasmanian I would usually be all for the Tassie team in anything, but i'm afraid that Mel, you are a wolf in sheep's clothing and a snobby stuck up woman, sure hope you can cook otherwise you're gonna get burned! and as for the victorian couple giving a low score last night, sucked in they still beat you! I would have loved that entree, we all dont aspire to be 5 hat chefs! 
is changing my teams GO NSW QLD SA ! 
I'm glad that the producers put Melanie onto the show this year, I'm thankful that someone isn't so sweet and nice, if all the contestants were sweet and nice and complimentery all the time it would get boring. Every show has to have a hero and a villain - they are both for entertainment purposes and that is what viewers want. If it wasn't for Melanie there would be less coments and less new pages being made. 
Has anyone read this crap, this is Melanie and James profile, are you serious, as if you would tell the world all this, and she is not modest at all is she and as for James, well he's the expert isnt he, i quote" the most extravagant he got was Tomato Sauce on Pasta" and he can critique the other teams dishes?? Melanie, 37, was married for 12 years to a chef who dominated their kitchen. "I didn't cook at all during that time," she says. "He just did it all. When we split up, I had to start cooking for myself and my two children. I found that not only could I cook, but I was pretty good at it too. "When I was married I only had four dishes to my name. Now I have hundreds and I realise what fun I missed out on." James, a 36-year-old jazz musician, was a notoriously bad eater. Tomato sauce on pasta was about as extravagant as he got. 
Why is everyone being so harsh about Mel??? She said exactly what she thought, and then allocated 6 points to the SA team. There was another 6, and a 5. They obviously didnt say what they honestly thought about the food, otherwise they would have given higher points. Mel was asked what she thought about the dish, and now she is getting shit because of HER OPINION. 
Heart FM Hobart - Shrek? Im watching the show every week. I cant see anyone that looks like Shrek ! Oh and btw...if i EVER go back to Hobart i will search for another radio station to listen to ...99.3fm edge radio or play "The Best Of Kenny Loggins" in my CD player....thanks !
Excuse me Mel, but seriously, indulge in a little more tact and friendliness ... who knows, it just might do you some good. Oh, and by the way, your hair cut & styling is a little "below average" and so too is the way you treat others, including your poor silent partner. And one more thing ... please try smiling, it will do wonders for your face, and those pre-mature frown wrinkles.
Lets hope Melaine comes crashing down tonight!!! She is nothing but a 'Negative Nancy' and not to mention her Husband that sits back and says nothing!! 
I think most of us understand that it's all about the ratings. But how many of us would lower ourselves to play this role if asked just to be on the show??? 
I bet channel 7 wil be the biggest rating since MKR started just to watch team tassie sink to a new low in the kitchen. 
How come episode 1 (video) has disappeared from the official website? :(
I'm wondering if she makes a similar assessment of James performance in the sack...."not enough meat and veges for my liking Pete"!! 
this is like high school people some of u are grown men/women seriously you are bagging her out saying needs slappimng,punching,things shoved up places and making groups that hate ffs its a tv show some people have very boring lives if this is what u have to do is bitch about a woman on a tv show
Hope the Tas team fail miserably tonight. The female of the couple is a real bitch. Come on SA.
Shame it's all taking away from the cooking, that's what I like to see, the personalities are so much less important to me,that's why I preferred the UK Masterchef to the Australian one and Come Dine With Me has just gone ridiculous, but reality tv seems to need to go that way.
The Tasmanian team dont like the other couples because they don't have 11 fingers and 12 toes.
Love the show,,and lets face it we all love a villian .Tassie has certainly stirred this page up RATINGS RATINGS RATINGS. I am wondering ,does James actually SPEAK ???
I find nothing wrong with the mushroom filled dish. If i was served that at a restaurant i would happily eat it all. But saying that's not a competition dish is just pathetic. What she's gonna cook tonight is not a competition dish. Steak. 
So, out of all the dishes served so far, given they'd be cooked perfectly for you, which would you most like to try? I think I'd like to try the poached pear in choc almond cake.
what is up with Melanie and James from Tassie? well its their turn tonight and we'll see how self righteous they are tonight won't we....it would make my day if they got less than 59...that would shut her up!!!
What food shall i nibble while watching MKR tonight? mmmm Maybe i shall have one giant slice of Mels humble pie. As long as its "Restaurant Quality"...thanks !
So can't wait to watch the Tassie team crash and burn tonight !!!
Just a heads up. Click 'Like' to this comment if you hope TAS do BAD tonight & gets a taste of their own medicine. Now, Now don't all come running at once!
does anybody realize the tassie team cooked third not fifth editing fellow MKR fans power of the media.do u watch for the cooking or the people. does that mean they beat victoria's score bad luck 
and tas need to get there own comments, with the the chocolate barrels and coconut icecream pete gave his comments, and tas said exactly the same comment as pete
cant wait for tonight im hoping tassie fall on there ass.To be so judgemental to others competing anyone would think they were professional chef's or one of the judges,my favourites so far are Qld and S.A,but i support my state W.A im sure our girls will cook up a feast,go W.A :)
tas is gonna go down in flames.....just like jesse james...
Mel from team Tassie should really think before she opens up her mouth-bagging others and always being so critical always comes back and bite you on the ass- what a show tonight will be!! (Victoria started off being a bit critical too and have quietened down dramatically since they had their turn). All the other couples seem nice and genuine-goodluck...
stop baging out mel she waz just haveing her say. its just a comp so get the hell over it. you all should do someting betta then bag some one out >:( 
why cant the Tassie girl just have some fun like all the others, why so angry, so sad.
Will watch tonight's episode just to see Tassie crash and burn but really looking for to Daniela and Stefania from WA cook!
the whinging tassie does she ever stop..
The team everyone is waiting to see cook is about to open their instant restaurant! Can Team TAS deliver? My Kitchen Rules is on NOW! (AEDT)
I know people have already made up their minds about the tassie team, and from watching the show myself - I honestly cannot blame you :) But in all seriousness, and I am not being biased as I havent met Mel, the show has been edited majorly to make them out to be the bad ones. James is an awesome guy - he isnt anything like he appears on tv! He never shuts up, and he is actually really funny! Watching the show, I actually can't believe its him on there. I know that Mel did say the things she said, but I think the editing has taken it way out of context - which makes her unlikeable. Sure, I can't deny she has a smug little smile - but even Sammy and Bella said last night that they think she is only pretending to be nice to everyone and then scoring them badly. So obviously, the bits we dont see, she isnt that bad. Also, the tassie team has been fair with their scoring - look at Lee and Kane who are scoring badly just to get ahead. 
i hope the tassie team choke on there food and bloody lose HATE HATE HATE them!!!!!!!
tassie dumb idiot melanie.......feel sorry for james he does not say even booooo
She thinks she is gods gift to food, well i think she just a bit of a tassie tosser
Do the tassie team realise how much all their whiny comments and criticism to the others have made them look ? Theyre going to be this years team that everyone hates... love everyones expressions each time she starts "oh i didnt like it" "not a competition dish" "im sorry but..." blah blah blah shut up !!!
Oh my god! Every word that comes out of her mouth is so awful! How on earth her husband puts up with it, I don't know. She makes me feel so negative. Awful to watch her. I wonder if she realises how she speaks to people. Anyway, let's see the food!
I dont think prawns are a competition dish.. haha - I cook fresh garlic and chilli prawns, crumbed calamari and grilled golden ban snapper most friday nights for my husband and the kids..
Lets just hope the Entree is a disaster.
Sorry Mel and James.. Cripsy Fried Prawns isn't a "Compeition Dish" that look like a Sunday Dinner!
Bloody Ads.................just get on with frying Tassie
Melanie is being such a total hypocrite. She said a mushroom filled dish was not a competition dish. I actually found the Mushroom more appealing and more competition-y than Prawn wrapped in Noodles.
 cant wait to see tassie FAIL!! they are grumpy sour faced bores!
I think James is suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. Someone should pull him aside and ask him if he is OK
tas team so bitchy and they are going dwn tonight, karma comes back and bites!!!!
James saved her there!
B...h didn't give him any credit for the salad
haha the dressing she stuffed it James fixed it, ha ha now she taking all the credit,b*t*ch
her prawns were a waste of time - his salad was wonderful 0:1
And WHO made that salad, HUH melanie?? I mean james mus'nt have cos he is NOT able?????!!!!!! Sooooooooooo stoooopid is what you are!!
without james u would have sucked!!!! 
Mels attitude is soggy like her prawns
WOoohoo praised James' salad and mocked her prawns! so funny
don't you know Mel you are spose to rest the meat for the same amount of time you cook it
Bahahaha! The meat's stuffed!
The friggen bitch is giving Tassie a bad name..She is just a Moron...
Again Like I said. Melanie is being a total hypocrite. She's using mushroom but Mushrooms aren't a competition dish.
pml imagine her between the sheets
James gets to do the beans - and Mel does the rest, talk about TEAM work -NOT hey Mel there is no "I" in team!
I think that Melanie and James are on the wromg show, THEY NEED DR PHIL!!!
LOVE james' shirt!
yey Pete says my beef is grey
I Don't give a rats about the meat... The mushrooms look repulsive... lol 
She says it was her fault. After all the guests leave she's probably going to yell at her husband for not telling her to take out the meat.
haha blue cheese butter James again, lets see if she claims it
So James can cook but Mel can't LOL
WE DIDN'T DELIVER !!!!! Why involve poor James now.
how tough is that meat!
Manu, is incredible, never let anything pass him without noticing
Mel's steak is crap: Jame's blue cheese sauce wonderful 0:2
Wohooo complimented all James' stuff and shot hers down! The steaks look horrible!
yeah.. gotta say that chick had it coming, you've really got to be careful what you say about other peoples menus.. well done on james though, he tried his best
Some humble pie for dessert eh Mel? The meat looks terrible... BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH - Looks like Karma is a bigger bitch than Melanie! 
Don't stir once it boils darling, OH PLEASE. I would rather hear Fran Fine's voice anyday
I am quiet shocked at how Mel puts her husband down, just b/c it isn't said in anger doesn't mean it is right. 
I hope she NEVER has children. Could you imagine being belittled like that constantly?
so hope they lift their game just to see Kanes face when he realises his end is near.
Melanie screwed up, you know what that means?...... James is in soooo much trouble! lol Would love to be a fly on the wall after everyone has gone home lol
Should be called Mels kitchen, poor James doesnt get a say in anything. But all the things he has done have turned out perfect... well done James!!!
love to hear chocolate is blocked!!!!
ah lol she forgot the rum 
HAHA - She forgot the rum!!!
WHAT!!! U FORGOT THE BLOODY RUM!!
She must have drunk the rum before cooking the meat! Cause only an idiot would butcher a beautiful piece of fillet like that! She should go to jail for such a travesty!
naughty naughtty Mel missing the rumHAHA
Well shut up Lee you were no good as well put us victorians to shame
this is what happen when you have two heads... they dont think the same and she forgot to put the Rum... what a mole..
Personally i think James secretly drank it as she's driving him to alcoholism!!!
5/10, come on I know she is a bit of a cow but the Vic team are no bloody better
I think Kane and Lee are just purposely scoring people low scores so they don't have to face elimination.
hey Mel for a dessert you have been making for years - can't believe u forgot the rum! hahaha!
Disappointed James didn't perform a Jazz number...where's the entrainment between courses...& it's a Jazz restaurant...
What fair and civilised teams the other States are! I would find it hard not to give tonight's team lower marks simply because of Mel's snobby comments about the previous teams' efforts.
Brother and Sister from Tassie had better produce something to match their mouth............
sucked in VIC, I dont like the tassie team but don't play dirty to stay in. 
75 no way, mel you have nothing to be proud of James saved your arse
its not so easy is it melanie shut your pie hole next time you judge.
Oh Melanie, you opiniated piece of work... Leave James alone and pull your head in, not so easy is it????
Melanie and James are incompatible. James is just like Melanie's side puppet. She makes him to all the stuff SHE doesn't wanna do. She always wants to do the " technical " stuff hence why even a simple dish like Prawns were " a waste of time ". James is better off with someone who isn't that bossy. 
I love this show. But one thing I really disagree with. When the first guys made the dessert with the pear inthe cake, the jusdges got the ones thatwerent that great, but the other contestants gotnice ones. The judges said "Unfortunately, we have to judge you on what we ate" ... Thats fair, BUT then the next couple, had the fish, and the judges fish was perfect, but the other contestants complained of bones, and dryness, and then, they took that into account. Did anyone else notice this???? Made me grrrrrrr ...
Why does Mel have to speak on James's behalf? doesn't he have a tongue?
If u forget a MAIN ingredient you should automatically get zero! Lets just hope the next round sees the tassie team gone! The judges r too kind! as for the other teams WTF! give them ZERO!
they didnt deserve the high marks ,and james needs a medal for putting up with melanie
What a piece of work Melanie is! James, tell her to pull her head in and stand up to her - you are an adult, not a 2 year old FFS.
YAY!! Go Mel and James :D Editing isnt going to affect the taste of their food :D
poor James, the she-devil steals his thunder then blames him for her boo boos. The constipated piping-bag was hilarious too...
What happen guys in nsw did she actually get good scores, if so then the ratings must have skyrocketed because of her actions. They can't afford to loose her now.go Mel we love to hate you
Friggin hilarious that everything she has prepared has failed with the judges but lucky James all the things he did was spot on! Such a bossy little thing isn't she. Hey james, GROW SOME BALLS!!!!!! Lol
poor James
James & Melanie luv each other, so obvious. Mel wears the pants......yep.......but go the Tasmanians....lol.....go the Victorians.......go the SAs.....heck...go u all. Interesting to see who will be the most disliked in the next group.
Have to agree with the flow, ridiculously high score but at least its pushing out Kane and Flea
I can NOT believe the scores that Tassie got for their BS food!!! Seriously, if I got what they dished up at a restaurant, I'd have sent each course back, and I don't do that at the drop of a hat!!! They killed the prawns, SLAUGHTERED the meat, and stuffed up half of the dessert!!! How the HELL can they score better than Donna and Reade with THAT effort?? RIGGED is how!! The producers must want to keep the "Bitch Factor" up, so got in the ears of the judges and other competitors to "up the scores"!!! They didn't deserve any better than Kane and Lee!!! VERY disappointed indeed!!!! And what's more, it is meant to be a TEAM effort, yet poor old James hardly did a damn thing, though the things he did do were the things that SAVED their arses - the dressing on the salad and the blue cheese butter!!!
I'm a Qld viewer, no daylight savings, so it's just started, fun!
Isnt Patong Beach in Thailand? Poor Reade must have been a little overwhelmed...."It screams Vietnam...reminds me of Patong Beach"
just watch,n tassie now,,,doesnt look good,,,,prawns are not good!!!! come on Queensland it,s where i live,,love the show,,
SHAME ON YOU Kane and Lee only scoring them 5, and scoring this low again just to try and get yourselves out from the bottom of the ladder!
Ok, the tassie couple are the most annoying people I've ever seen. Melanie's just a mole and James is just a suck hole. Get your head out of that bitches arse.
the tassie couple had a great menu but they just messed up with technique. shes a pain though and he just follows what she says! they tried very hard though but i dont feel compassionate to them,is karma they messed up.nsw are still the ones to beat! 
I wouldnt have eaten that steak if I ordered it medium in a restaurant
Ha ha its just TV show, luvin how you all get pissed off with the Tasmanians...the hubby is great, so what 'he's under the thumb'.....would luv to see all you people commenting have a go with a wifey like that....wonder what your score would be haha :)
I agree with all the comments. To leave out a main ingredient and get that score is not fair. I think all the other contestants were very nice to them considering they have been so rude and making comments about cooking when they are only amateurs. To put the icing on the cake for Mel to be so unpolitical and use the word retarded was out of place. She is very nasty, I hope she does not win
I thort the couple were quirky and they complimented each other really well, unless there is a dramtic ending i dont know about lol... Im just watchn it on IQ now.. He's so mellow he evens out her edgey highly strung nature... I luv him, i rekon hes cool... Lol great 2 see what everyone thinks luv the show, and arent the judges great!! R they a bit fatter this year lol anyone notice that?? Also the french one has a crook neck yeh? He has trouble turning it... Not being slack i think hes hot!!
I think Kyle Sandilands and Gordon Ramsay will do justice to this show LOL 
Well done Mel and James, you did Tassie proud!
BRING IT ON W.A. GIRLS Remind People it's a Cooking show not just about ratings........No way were the tassie's better than SA
...and how nice was it when the blondey reminised about her memories of her cool dad who enjoyed eye fillet with mushroom!!! Brought a tear 2 my eye... Food is memories, she sure hit a nail on the head there... Lol first time my mum made me eat mushrooms i hurled lol i will never forget that.. I hated em but now my palate has changed n i luv them... Funny mum made me eat them but she hates them lol, my nans favorite tho with butter fried god rest ur soul nanna xoxoxox i woulda cooked u a mean mushroom if u were still round!!! Naaawww 
Wow they did pretty well for really difficult menu just a few screw ups , they might be nasty but they did do well.let's hope they lighten up
She spoke to her husband like a woman talks to a little boy in a child care centre! Could you IMAGINE the outcry about infantilising and patronising that would be elicited if a husband spoke to his wife like that on tv? Then again, what's he doing taking that at all?
What a load of crap a 7 and an 8 for the entree when the main part of it was overcooked; even a 4 and a 5 for there main was a bit high; And to leave out a key ingredient and still get what they got for there mains is just crap.
I have walked the middle road all week, being reasonable. But I hated tonights episode, it seemed rigged and unrealistic. Scoring was crap and I don't like the Tassie's. Gloves off now. Should not be ahead of SA ! Meat destroyed, prawns average, no rum and average sauce on pudding. Rubbish. Shame MKR!!!
Mel = Mole. Hopefully this scare will stop her bitching about others. She has been snippy and bitchy all week. James, good luck with the marriage. Vic, you're gone. You can score everybody 5's but you're still be on your way...
It's called Karma Melanie! James - Stand up for yourself !
Can't wait for the repeat as I didn't get to see it all tonight but what I did see was hilarious....forgeting the rum blahhhh!
I don't think Tazzy should have gotten the score they did, they made alot of mistakes. I found it interesting that although Mel knows more about cooking apparently, James did better with the parts he made...
mels quite a nasty person james shud man up im really shockd of their scores but i expect great things from WA
I've missed a lot of Mel's comments I think altho I've plenty of my own about her... tonite I thought I saw something about her that seems to come across the wrong way. I don't think she knows how people view her to be honest as even tho she's bossing James around she doesn't get angry she keeps her cool.. I think it's more a bad habit and he's just as bad as he's let her do it... that's my 'Dr Phil' opinion.. :))
Out of all the reality shows on tv, from this point on, MKR needs public voting...Everyone in Australia just seen prawns and eye fillet overcooked, and a good dessert missing an ingredient...Yet we also seen the judges score WAY to high...Bring on public voting, we could teach Tassie a thing or two...
I seriously cannot stand that stuck up Tasmanian Devil Woman but unfortunately she adds value to the show given she is so far up her own rear and makes it hilarious to watch. I think her husbands voice is in his forehead which is explains why we can't hear him because he is obviously UNDER the THUMB! Gross, gross woman! Hopefully someone adds humble pie to their menu and she eats a really big slice!
... And TAS did infact cheat a little bit. When they ran out of custard sauce for their desert, she started dishing up another batch she had prepared earlier. Don't the rules state that they aren't allow to start preparing their dishes before the allocated 3 hour time. Yet they did.... They should be penalised for this!!!
Cannot beleive the tassie DEVIL forgot to put rum in the dessert..yet they still gave her a reasonable score !!!! WTF ..If I ordered that in a restuarant I would want my money back..but still luv ya pete and manu xo
My Kitchen rip off! seriously 75? just for her bloody attitude she should have scored all 5s. Not once I felt that mouth watering sensation. I would have much prefered to experience that beans dessert than being served a poor chewi piece of overly cooked meat! She cooked every thing her self the hubbie did nothing.what was with the second batch of creme? she prepared it the day b4 shoulndt this be against the rules? last night she commented on those gorjus stuffed mushies, said they were paesans food and she goes and pan frys 2 mushies and serves 'em on a bland plate with no dressing? WTF seriuolsy. 
To the judges... common we all thought u were better than that . you guys had that poor fellow nearly killed for cooking the tuna for a second more yet you loved it, and u wanna tell us that a salad with a non crispy prawn is a 7? u said it urself it was crap yet u scored 7? Peter , mate 8 for a watered down creme englaise with missing rum? thats basics.Last night ice cread deserved a 10 if that was a 8. I m sorry i lost my interest on the show.
Guys, we all love to hate her. But that is exactly what the producers want! We'll all be tuning in each week just to get a dose. And when she skulks away with her tail between legs we'll all love it! I love the S.A couple from last night. Love their energy. 
Mel you are very quick to pick faults in other peoples cooking but what about yours your prawns were average, your meat disaster the desert basic ingredient omitted. I think the show is rigged your were marked to high 
Lol at the Tassie's : Over cooked prawns & Beef dish , No rum in the desert . Mel is the " Man of The House " , James needs a dress the dude is abit of a "Soft-Cock " needs to harden up abit : Beers with boys , Hard game of Footy etc etc , You need to take hold of the household son ! .... Lol ........... Go Sammy & Bella , SA & WA :)
Ok Ok, its a toss-up between...... do we want to see them leave this week? ooorrrr ..... do we have them hang around a little longer to get all hot under the collar about HER and LOVE IT ! The sour face, the unpleasant comments, the kissing .....eewww the kissing. If only we could vote!
Haha at Tassie, they are terrible cooks! Nooo Rum in Desserts, where is hell your thinking, Tassie??? Medium rare Beef? I would never order the medium rare beef, no way... I would like my meat is well done..... Tassie, Get lost your standard.. GOOO QLD & NSW!!! 
someone got their just desserts............
 I have no idea why Mel entered them in this comp, she has no faith in James' abilities, she has done nothing but criticize him for the last 10 mins and they havent even started yet!He is SOOOOOOOOO WHIPPED!
Mel has some serious issues she would have been better off serving up Maccas. James grow some kahunas 
Bad example of a meat thermomter in use on tonights show, open the oven and check it every five minutes letting heat and moisture out everytime?! WT!...try using a digital thermometer with a wire probe that stays in the oven/cooker and tellos you exactly when its cooked perfectly!...see ...ebay...or kamadocookers ..for more info...
i could not imagine being married to Mel! she treats James like a child!!
Mel shut ur hole and let James speak for once. ewwwwwwww James kissed her
Hummmmm...so what is it that James actually does in this competition? Not seeing a hell of a lot of cooking going on for his part....
I wonder if that tassie chick pats her hubby behind the ear before she gives him a bowl of milk and puts him into his doggie bed for the nite ??? lol OMG id have to slap it lol
I give Mel a 1 and James a 10
What a waste of meat Mel. Who or why would you cook Eye Fillet medium????
Prays whole heartedly that Beelzebub aka " Princess Of Darkness " will cast a spell (Lose her voice ) on the Nasty Witch Of Tasmania ........ God that woman got a wicked tongue !
The Vic team are spiteful little buggers too trying to get themselves off the bottom of the ladder
what a load of shit over cooked meat no rum in the desert salds anyone can make a salad what a load f shit
OMG meat over cooked hahaha, shame on you Tasmania!!! You reap what you sow. Magnificient Salad James. Poor man, he needs a medal~~~ BUT then again stand up for yourself I say.BUT You're not first place hehehehe
i might be from VIC but im not liking the VIC couple on here...just cos u did crap stop whinging about everyone elses meals...people aernt gonna vote lower cos U dont like em...love manu <3 
I'm not a fan of Melanie but I have to give credit where it is due - so well done to James on his vietnamese salad & blue cheese butter. Looking forward to the " Doubled-U-A" (WA) girls - Carn the Itallianos!
personalities aside.....the people I want to see cook again are Sammy & Bella (NSW), Reade & Donna (SA), & Melanie & James (believe it or not - Mel can clearly cook - she understood the mistakes she'd made & could obviously perform a number of techniques)...Daniela & Stefania from WA are yet to cook. These people can cook (and yes made mistakes) but I want to see more of their cooking. 
I have been saying for ages how nasty mel is & I'm from tassie too but seeing that this is tv show & everything is heavily edited have they made her the one to look the nasty contestant she is nicknamed the tassie devil after all. Btw vermeys meats are the best & the butchers in their are like reallllly hot ! :D 
Lets see how W.A goes tomorrow night on my kitchen rules,tassis scored better than what i was expecting,but couldnt cook as good as they made out,professional's not,maybe now they might not be so judgemental now they were under preasure,Her husband seemed to do better in the kitchen.......COME W.A GAME ON lol 
just watching tonights show again lol!
how could she ruin such fantastic meat? She's ruined the husband too.....
I am not a fan of Mel's not at all in any way Tassie Devil is an appropriate name I think!!! If she goes too much further my family doesn't want to watch it anymore. I HATE the way she continually put others cooking down AND she continually puts her hubbie down and he even started putting himself down! They were scored WAY too high!! Probably because of the childish faces she was pulling.... grow up your an adult lady, I don't even let y teenager get away with sulking like that!!!
Despite all the hate mail, I think Mel has it in her to go a long way into the competition - overall, she handled the stress quite well and was very organised in the kitchen.. Will be interesting to see how this all pans out... I'm looking forward to trying the Vietnamese inspired salad!
I think Mel needs to lower her nose level slightly. Her attitude and insults towards others makes her dis-likable. They presented some nice looking dishes last night with some good flavors but so have other contestants. If she did drop her nose down a level she may not have made the errors she did. This is a competition and the other teams want this just as bad as she does. Give them a fair go too Mel and drop the upper-class attitude. They gave you a fair-go last night and put your insults behind them which is why you are still there. Now be just as fair to the woman!!!!!!
MANU and PETE should hang their heads in SHAME for the scores they dished to this cheat and fluffer, their credibility has slipped to a low point as far as I'm concerned !!! 
Im pretty sure if i served a dessert in my restaurant that had a major missing ingredient, and just happened to dish it up to a food critic i wouldn't get an 8 out of 10....! 
Notice how pleasant it was last night to listen to the comments be them positive or negative without having a whinging whining Mouthy Mel at the table screwing up the nose and glancing at the hen pecked husband for support. Better to see her under pressure like it should be in the kitchen for novices. What a tool having to put a thermoter in the meat and not knowing the difference between celsius and Farrenhiet. How embarrasing for James not knowing what to do next and just taking all the crap and what ever he attempted it was not right in her beadie eys.
I do love that the two things that James prepared were complimented on by the judges ... Melanie was trying to not look bitter and twisted about that !!!
Has anyone made any of the dishes shown so far ???? I remember last year there were lots of Photo's of Gabe and Mossey's cheese cake.......and the Vics Chocolate cake ??
Gee James said being with Mel has been the best four years of his life. I think when he can finally pick his hen pecked arse off the floor and remove the thumb print from his forehead he might see Mel for what she really is. Im glad he got the praise for his food last night and Mel ended up with egg on her face. 
Do the shows producers feel bad that they've chosen coles as their main sponsor. Right now Id be embarrased. Dropping the price of THIER milk to compete with local farmers after all the devastation we have endured...it's un-Australian, and I for one, refuce to shop there, and now refuse to watch this show. I wonder how our "chefs" feel about this??
On Kane and Lee - I think it's unfair to say they are whingers. They are only saying what realistically needs to happen for them to stay in the competition. They need something to go wrong for WA tonight (don't think it will though!) or else they are OUT. So they kind of have to say that they hope disaster strikes. I'd be more criticial of them if they were saying "no we are happy to be last and to lose and we hope the other teams are AWESOME!" Disappointing - I would have quite liked to have had Kane on my screen for a little while longer. 
The salad that came with the entree looked great and the rest of the meal, to be honest looked like crap!! The main looked dry and boring, just a roast eye fillet, such a waste of a beautiful cut of beef. The dessert, anglaise either runny or split, looked disgusting if it didn't have the spun sugar on it, it would have been a dud!! Go the WA mamas!!
Didnt anyone notice how she contradicted herself through the show, one minute she said she done everything bagging James out next thing she is saying that he helped. I actually started feeling sorry for James being married to her poor guy, does he ever get a word in, if i treated my husband like that he would slap me or leave me!! The part he cooked was the best part " slow and steady wins the race" bahahahahahahahaha.......
I'm loving how JAMES'S salad hit the spot and the dressing HE FIXED...plus HIS cheese...whilst everything Mel touched was a disaster!!! GO JAMES...you're almost out from under her thumb!!
i havent ben watching this series...but from what i am reading sounds like a bunch of whinging cooks?? if thats the case i will wait for masterchef season..
I don't understand why the TAS couple got top scores when there were so many issues. Why are there two teams under them? I'm not being mean because of Melanie, but the food wasn't up to scratch on any of them, the desert was the best meal and that was missing the main ingredient. I just don't think its fair thats all. I also think James is probably a nice guy, he seemed a bit nervous when the cameras were around I noticed. 
"The proof is in the pasta" lol - Go the West Aussie gals!!
i love this show am looking forward to tonight and the italian girls from perth last night very interesting melanie is very controlling poor hubby.
I love that we are all excited about the WA girls tonight, feels better than all hating that other team, who were they???????
feel sorry for James for marrying a bitch like her, but for sure will try to make HIS vietnam salad looks yummo..btw GO WA!!!
Oh goodness me it is a real worry = the Peter guy appears to be the only supporter of the 'you know who' team - struggling a bit with it and having to refer to the dictionary..... Should be focussing more on the show and not wasting time on them. Woman's Day - that would be the last straw - no one would read it!!! How long does the series go - at this rate it may be taken off the air!! 
Love Kitchen Rules...watched last night and couldn't get over how much she acts like a mother to him instead of a wife. No wonder he stayed out pouring drinks for so long. I would hate to be in the kitchen with her, my nerves would be frayed. Can't wait to see what the WA girls cook
Anyone seen Heart FM ?? They were all mouthy the other day. After their Tassie team cooked last night i would have thought they would be on here shouting how great they were or did i miss Heart FM's post today??
Love My Kitchen Rules. So far I am not a fan of Kane & Lee (VIC) or Melanie & James (TAS). I think Melanie is being way too critical......I cannot wait to see Daniela & Stefania (WA) cook. I think they will be fantastic! and I am a fan of Donna & Reade (SA), however I am a QLDER so GL Artie & Johnny (QLD)!!!
I feel sorry for the people of Tassie because Melanie and James are making such a beautiful place with such awesome people look really bad by being so nasty!!! 
Hmmm, can Artie and Johnny whip up 2000 litres of caustic soda jelly in a wading pool and have Lee and Melanie fight a nude wrestle for the crown of Ms Nastieness!
Pffft don't let mel & james put you off tassie ! still come & you'll lurve it! Btw vermeys meats the butchers in there are super duper hot as :D 
How come Mel and James were allowed to use a rum creme anglaise that she had cooked earlier in the day because she hadn't made enough in the 3 hours? Others had to eat what was cooked in that 3 hrs!
I think after last night Melanie can eat her own words!! It's funny most things the judges liked James had made!! So I don't think Mel is as good as she thinks she is!! 
sorry but i think some of the comments on here are going a bit too far.It's 'My Kitchen Rules' and not My State Rules ,so let's not forget THE FOOD.I haven't liked Tas or Vic but we don't really know these people and i'm pretty sure that some very clever editing takes place.The same thing happened to a lady on the last Masterchef,,i think it's all a bit cruel. May the best team(who can cook) win 
Ok how the hell can a team score so highly when they have incredibly simple dishes that were "sunday night dinner" quality (which Melanie has constantly used as a reason to give low scores to other teams), Two dishes that you would be within your rights to send back if you were given them in a restaurant, lumpy overcooked custard made before the alloted time (cheating), runny custard with the main ingredient missing, meat well overcooked and no option given to the guests as to how they would like it done, not giving whats on the menu twice (rum custard and crispy noodles)???.... seriously, does it matter that their accompaniments are brilliant when the main part of the dish is so very wrong?? I know others have said this but im so annoyed!!! lol Go WA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tassie should be disqualified last night she used a custard which she had made earlier in the day when she ran short. the cooking is only suppose to start three hours before hand...
I think Melanie obviously wasnt as confident as she would like us to believe--- why make custard the day before????? She is as they say" a piece of work""". 
HEY I THINK THEY SHOULD GET A TEAM FROM DARWIN ,NT 
What score did they get last night and where are they sitting on the score board , i missed the ending...Thanks
i'm with Bron, it should be about the food not the poeple, i feel really bad for Mel as ANYONE can be made out to be nasty with a bit of prompting and editing. They always create characters in reality tv shows, it very sad for the people in the line of fire and kind of boring and predictable to watch. The food so far has been really diverse and interesting and i can't wait to see what the girls dish up tonight! Good luck everyone
I now think this show maybe fixed after the TAS team got a truley unbelievable score. How many times have we heard the judges say 'Its not whats on the menu " and then gone on to score low. The prawns and noodles were not crispy ! The main was a disaster and where was the rum in the desert ! So by the rules all low scores. But F*** me they changed the rules ! Shocking.
Anyone know the relationship between Peter Andrews (a poster here) and the Tassie team? Is Peter from James' band or a brother / brother-in-law? His posts hint he knows them but does he really? Is he from Tourism Tasmania? Or a Mel and James groupie? Any thoughts?
maybe I should start a page called "People from the My Kitchen Rules Page Who just want to talk about the food" lol
doesn't that break the 'rules' about the Tasi couple making an extra batch of custard, the day befor,
Bad enough the contestant from Tasmania used the term "retarded", but you put it to air. Shame on you.
I am really enjoying watching MKR however feel the need to share my disappointment in Melanies use of the word Retarded.... it just shows up the true ignorance of some people :(
Can someone tell me what Melanie was saying about the menu ? I only just started watching.
Geezus melanie is saying Daniella and Stefania's menu is SIMPLE can she just say something nice for a change!!
How can tassie Melanie say w.a. Have simple menu.she cooked a prawn salad u can't get more simple than that
I want to see if they edit out everything James says ! Thats what their friends have been saying, and last night, although whipped, he was charming ! Not a Mute !!
P*^s off Melanie, you're not a vegetarian now!!! I'm embarrassed that i'm from Tas and share the same name.
Melanie reckons the gnocci is dense..... thats the pot calling the kettle black hahahaha
Saying someones Menu is very simple is very hypocritical. Prawns for an entree. I would rather eat rubbery Gnocci than eat a piece of shit made by Melanie. She's such a pathetic little bitch.
Be QUIET Melanie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! your driving me nuts!!!!
Dont worry about your portion size being smaller melanie id be more concerned about your friggin brain size!!
I feel sorry for Melanie. She obviously has an ego complex as she needs to bag everyone else to make herself feel good. 
I'm sure they gave her the smaller portion on purpose - reduce the size of her butt so less crap can come out of it. It may be bad editing as surely someone can't be that much of a cow.
Cant wait to see Mel'a score!!!!! it will probably be 0! she's obviously not satisfied in her life!! this show makes me hungry by the way!!! does anyone else feel the same?
Do you think Mel and James will get bumped from the 3rd spot?
which that tassie b*t*h would choke on a goat bone, didn't her mother teach her if you have nothing nice to say then keep your trap shut! 
yeah Melanie sux big time but what about Kane & Lee they are nasty little cow's always wanting the other teams to fail. 
I wish this show was determined by the viewers, Melanie would have been voted off first show.... James your a pathetic man that is too afraid to stand up to your EVIL wife
Tacky is a ridiculous word for the icing sugar ! Messy maybe, odd word choice.
OMG i can't believe her, come on just be positive
I know what!!! Mel just doesn't have any test of food she is eating
Melanie may be a nasty piece of work...but her husband is a hole lot worse..Does that man have a backbone? What a weak pathetic man..
Onll watched last night now, not watching this show again, How the fuck did they score 75 with Soggy Prawns, Overcooked meat, And a shit dessert, but wait OMG the Salad and Butter was gr8, who the fluck cant make salad and butter, TOTALLY RIGGED SHOW
OMG she is just a bitch - she hasnt said one thing nice about anyone bloody cow
It's just not doing it for me.............What in the f##k would do it for you. POOR JAMES
wow, i cant believe how catty Mel is, so much went wrong with her meal and she is still so so critical of everyone else!! and that smirk!! you just wanna wipe it off her mouth, she says all those horrible things in such a sweet tone (kind of makes me think of Doroles Umbridge in Harry Potter, they called her a toad. I think we should name Mel the Toad).
from the comments already i agree that mel is a narky cow that is evil and i wish the public could vote the bitch off, who doesn't know what she want's and then gives a good score every time, but i love the judge's who appear the 2 best judge's on any TV reality show, manu rocks and pete is down to earth class.
Mel, you're just really doing it for me!! 
I think Melanie just thinks she knows everything about food because she was married to a Chef for 12 years. She probably gave him the attitude she was giving to James yesterday. That was probably why he divorced her. I highly doubt it was her that divorced him. I would've done the same if I was in James' position.
OMG im ashamed to say melanie is a tasmanian,PLEASE do not judge us by that bitch cause she is a BITCH
Thats rubbish.... How can you give them a 6 for rubbery gnocchi, yet Tassie can omit a key ingredient (rum) and get 8 or 9?????
SPOILER COMING DONT LOOK IF YOU DONT WANT TO KNOW !!
hopefully our 2nd Tassie team bring it home for us show them what we are really like and that is not negative & bitchy
Now there are more drop kicks coming from tassie in team 2!!!
in the new teams, Restaurant Managers? i thought there not suppose to have experince in the industry,???mmmmmm 
I really just wanna slap Mel stupid!
OMG I nearly fainted when they said baby goats... I'm sure it was lovely but no way could I have eaten it. 
After tonights show i feel a little excited again,last night was so disappointing i thought of giving it a miss, i will hang in there, though it is so hard to watch Pete and Manu. NOT..........
I really like the NSW and WA team :)!
OMG what is wrong with that nasty piece of work Melanie.......... eating meat again doesnt seem to agree with her. I wonder what she was like as a vegetarian ?????????
Will some one just gag that Mel!! She is spoiling the show!! I am so sorry Tassie that she is putting her name to your great state, you deserve so much better!!
Good on the girls, they did well, but I just HATE that kind of dumb wog, pro-nounce ev-er-y word corr-ectly thing. The goat (poor baby goat) dish looked scrumptious, but what was with baking the gnochi? I could just TELL that there was a twist coming at the end, but Kane and Lee lost and should go home, but Lee's hot so they're getting a second chance. There's a good reason why group 2 are group 2 as well, they're freaks!
Gotta say....Mel from Tassie.....it's not that she is from Tassie that has anything to do with it. She is just who she is and unfortunately a very unlikeable character. In reality I'd like to think she might be a nice person. Perhaps just overly competitive. BUT....being the person she is, she won't get far in the competition. All the best to everyone competing.....although I live in Tassie, my vote doesn't go to Mel and her husband.
why why why is mel so critical? i just don't get it and i'm glad we won't have to see her for a while... 
I hope you read this Mel cos you are the most bitter MOLE. Your King Island door stop was more tender than you. You can't say anything nice about ANYTHING. Poor James. He has a life of you ahead of him.
That Mel woman seems to enjoy being permanently negative. imajgine selling a used car to her...or being her travel agent.lol
i cant stand stupid tazzie cow nothing is ever any good hope youz go cant even cook a decent peice of beef grrrrr 
Why did Tassie score so high when they used the custard that they had cooked earlier in the day. I thought the cooking was done in the 3 hour time frame.
i feel sorry for that Tassie bitches husband... then again, as if you'd marry the mole!!
Clearly she has inferiority issues and has to be a nasty piece to make herself feel more adequate........... Pump yourself up your going to need it mole, I mean Mel lol
Poor James. You should never chase women on RSVP or you will end up with a dog like Mel. Man he has a life sentence with that bitch. She has no redeeming features. 
OMG MELANIE - JUST SHUT UPPPPPPPP!!! You had your chance to show everyone what you're made of and honey you failed to deliver. So put your half smart comments in your back pocket and SHUT UPPPP!!!!
Think if I keep watching this show I might need a new TV as I am going to throw something at it... If I hear Mel say one more negative thing... Ok give you feed back but shit women your just a nasty BITCH!!!
If your going to have a bitch in the series at least give her a brain! This makes her look so stupid! I feel sorry for her newly wedded husband hahahaha
My god I felt a moment of pity for mel last night. But her nasty mouth just can't help itself. She seriously has no idea how she comes accross.
you are being depicted as such an awful awful person...now it is on TV and may not be your true self, with your spots just showing your spits....but lady....if this is how you are all the time.....what an embarassment you are to yourself... and what low self esteem you have....buy a new attitude lady!!!!! 
Why does Melanie have to be so nasty. She has this half grin on her face all the time. No one is perfect and Mel made mistakes as well so suck it up a little and be nice. The rest of the teams (team 1) are gorgeous. Will Team 2 have a nasty b*#*# in it. I hope not. I love this show so don't ruin it Melanie.
Just dont get that Mel, why be patronising, condescending, snobbish, over critical...........damn now i sound like her............we know its a competition but as Bambis dad said if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all
I reckon they should have Mel on as a judge for the second group just to show them what a nice person she is.
I loved the girls tonight they had me in stitches the way they fought with each other but in a nice way. I don't like Italian food it's the some old same old to me and I don't like stewy stuff but I loved their pav's...I think they "done good"
Bring on the second team's.... Looks like they will make Mel look like a try hard! This is a competition of great food not how nasty you can be to win!
what is the score for the WA team i missed the ep 
Feels sorry for all the decent tassie folk !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Bring on the second round. Note that some of the teams are a similar format to last season. Two best mates from NSW (Clint and Noah, last season) Bring on the great meals and fun. Hard to top WA for fun. Great effort WA Girls.
I think that everybody on here is being a little to reactionary towards Mel. Whilst I dont agree with everything she is saying I think that she is certainly competent in the kitchen and after all this is a reality TV show and the producers through editing can choose to present each contestant in whatever way they like! I do question the scoring which often appears inconsistent - whilst tonights food sounded warm and comforting it was far from appetising, even for rustic Italian food! As the competition heats up the Italian girls will need to bring a lot more to the table in the way of presentation. 
I think Victoria should have been disqualified for giving crap points mainly cause they thought they were going to be eliminated. Hope the other Tassie team don't think there better then the judges!.
James if she was the best you could find on a dating service you should of stayed single ........
Seriously Mel needs to take a class in constructive criticism!!!! Although what would remove that sour look from her face I have no idea????? any suggestions??? haha. Poor James. Go the Italian girls!!!!! 
Mel needs to shut her mouth as she never has anything positive or nice to say and stop belittling her husband. He needs to grow some manhood and toughen up!! 
Mel looks and sounds like she sucks lemons for brekky!
Mel from Tassie, you need to be aliminated just to get you off the programme...James I feel sorry for you. Stop trying to dominate everyone Mel.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They had to have an equivalent to the Adelaide bitch last season - everyone loves to hate someone and everyone loves it when everything goes wrong for the hated couple!
If your happy & you know it clap your hands (clap, clap), if your happy & you know it & the Italian Mamma's really showed them, if your happy & you know it clap your hands (clap, clap). Well done Daniela & Stefania. Just love the WA Mamma's (they crack me up), they are my favourites along the SA couple & the NSW girls.
Mel, the map of Tassie is south! So go there and don't come back! Nasty, Nasty piece of work! The girls from WA made gnocchi by hand and you couldn't even control a piping bag! Read this and weep!
You know what.... i was thinking yeah edits make Mel look bitchy and mean but tonight i saw it has nothing... ( reading Peter "best mates with team tassie" Andrews? ) ... N O T H I N G to do with editing of the show. She says what she thinks and what she thinks is all nasty ! No edit required !
I especially can't stand how Melanies says everything through smiling teeth? Have you noticed how she puts so much effort into her 'niceness?' Grrrrr she is one pretentious nutcase....!!! I could tolerate her more if she didn't try to be so smiley when she doesn't it mean it that much....espcially with some of the critisism she dishes out.
i am LOVING the fact that thanks to Melanie - the use of the word "mole" has been used a gazillion times on status updates since the show started... =)
Tassie lady is a bitch! if she is such a full authority on food she should be in the industry i feel sorry for Hubby he seems like a nice bloke
Did Anyone agree icing sugar on desert was "TACKY" ? Unnecessary, maybe, untidy. But Tacky seemed harsh when Mel used pre-made lumpy creme anglaise and forgot the rum ? That desert tonight looked wonderful. I was shocked by the harsh comment. Didn't seem consistent with critisism's from last night at all !
Oh so agree - hate that Tassie woman Mel! I feel so sorry for her husband - life with her must be hell as there is no pleasing her! On a brighter note - Daniella and Stefania you made WA proud girls - wasn't worried about your pavs as you make the most incredible cakes and sweets that I have ever tasted :) The Italian Mamas ROCK!!!!!
Go WA Italian girls, great job on the cooking tonight! Can't wait for Tasmania to be eliminated. I cannot stand the Tasmanian Devil mole! She whinges about all the food while eating it at the same time. She's just jealous :P lol
Hi congrats the WA girls what a hoot and fun you bring to the show.I live in N.S.W and reading every comment about Mel has cracked me up they are all spot on. Thank god I don't have a Mel in my life how many of us have wanted to just see all her attempts fail,karma has a way of dealing with her,R.I.P to her Menu.To all the other teams best of luck
My favourites are NSW and WA although I am a Qld'er, why do they have the states competing againt each other ? last night I turned it over a few times because of Mel and her comments , but my daughter made me turn it back over , her comments just frustrate me so much,makes me want to jump in the tv ..... Grrrr
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who finds Mel and James annoying. I'm sick of her bitchy comments about everyone's food. I just want to slap her every time she opens her mouth! Mel and James would be my choice for elimination.
I can't stand Mel & James - they are so stuck up that they need to go! Who do they think they are???????
ahhh I cant stand the 2 housemates cos they have low scores they give eveyone low scores just in hope another couple will score lower If u watch them they way the score like when the Tas cple had cooked they did know their food and had the right idea and know what flavours go wtth what but they just gave an overall score like 5 cos the meat was overdone where other contestants looked at the presentation, flavours etc
Hey has anyone made Sammy and Bella's beetroot soup yet? I have printed off the recipe but haven't attempted it yet... would love to hear from anyone who has x (PS on principle will not cook any of Mel's dishes, I'd have to keep kissing myself to do that wouldn't I?)
Lol I just read all the comments about Mel! She need to learn the phrase 'give credit where credit is due'! But go S.A!! both seem such lovely characters, i enjoy watching them =)
Mel just parrots every criticism the judges make so it makes it sounds like she knows what she is talking about
i loved the girls last night even tho im from vic, i picked them the 1st night mkr was on to win, and mel get over your self everyone else has, pete found a bit of meat in the gnocci and sed he should have told them it was going to be cooked with meat and that someone could have been vegetarian, and surprise surprise mel used to be, how come every thing that happens to someone in the show, its happened to mel its going to happen to her or it just happened to her they show just aint about her she likes to get all the attention, i just read a article in the tv week on mel and she sed she is anice person and is not mean
oh Maria I SO agree with you that Tassie Tiger is the biggest bitch I have ever seen, has nothing nice to say about anyone, I was so wishing when it was there turn that everything would drop on floor, and congrats W.A. not from there but ooooh I envied everyone there
seriously can someone be hated as much as Mel ? Would someone just give her a serve for real, who does she think she is ? No wonder she stuffed up the king island beef she was a vego for 12 years so of course she couldn't cook it correctly, and for a simple menu she can talk, i would love to see her try to make gnocchi and goat she wouldn't know where to begin. Obviously she was never taught, if you have nothing nice to say, then say nothing at all. good luck to the rest of the group but she has to go, lucky for her the public don't vote.
I cant stand Melanie, if it wasn't for her husband i would hate to see what her score would of been and speaking of scores how the hell did they get a pretty high score with over cooked prawns and meat and her desert was crap, i think the other contestants were way to nice to the bitch i hope she loses big time i feel sorry for her husband..... Go all the other teams boot the tassie bitch out lol 
Mel you crashed and burned I just don't know HOW you get the scores you did,the WA girls how much fun did they have.Looking forward to the next group of cooks !!!!!!!
wishing that sooner or later Mel gets that smile wiped off her face she bad mouths everyone and when it was her turn no one did it to her !! go the sisters !! great food and what a beautiful house :)
I think Mel is to ashamed to come on this forum because she know's that she's unwanted and unpopular on FB and Australia-wide . and James stop beig a " Cock-Head " hiding behind your wife's apron strings , Stand the Hell up speakout and be counted ..... Are you a MAN , a BOY or just a obedient TOY ? . The choice is yours .
Good luck to all the new teams
Hi, there was a recipe on the My kitchen Rules website, with scallops....I can't seem to find it, just wondering if anyone else has seen it or copy it. Thanks advanced.
i am sooo proud of the WA Italian girls they did knock Sammy and Bella off their top Perch but the cam very very close!!!! good on them..will be interesting to watch this next group!!!! to see what they have to offer!!
That Mel was a total embaressment to her husband she made an absolute fool of him and made herself look like a complete cow she is so critical and bitter god help James imagine being married to that GOOD LUCK JAMES YOU ARE GONNA NEED IT MATEY 
Mel is definitely not that good at cooking. I think the reason that they scored well is because she chose quite an impressive menu, even though cooking that menu was obviously way beyond her capabilities. And I'm guessing that the producers want to keep her in the show cos people like to watch it just so that they can hate her!
Need help with dinner, can anyone suggest something... I have fresh chicken thigh fillets, coriander/cilantro, parsley, basil, green onions, baby leaf mesclun, snow peas, bean shoots and organic tomatoes... Want to make something tasty and child friendly. Any suggestions?
Bad enough the contestant from Tasmania used the term "retarded", but you put it to air. Shame on you.
Hands up who wants Mel and James from Tassie to fall flat on their faces?
Missed the show last night... Who scored the least? I imagine the italian duo would have scored pretty high.... So whats the verdict? 
Meanlie (Melanie From TAS) is hypercritical who should just keep her mouth shut... shes annoying me now lol hope Team Tas get their comeuppance... big style... all the eps ive seen shes always complaining...
I am agreeing with everyone re: Melanie / TAS.. When it finally was time for her to cook she made all the mistakes and her husband actually pulled through. Would really like to see HER hand make gnocchi (wouldn't happen)....... Think she should stop complaining and learn how to cook prawns..
Oh wow, can anyone give me a heads up on the convo with Paul Daniel Mcewan ? I went for some dinner ( not tea Mel ! ) and his rants have been taken off and his profile too ! I made myself a coffee and was ready to read some funny stuff,... reported? did it turn ugly? oohhh just saw a sneak peak of the new lots of tea...ms......looks F U N ! cant wait................bring it !
I couldnt stop laughing the other night when mel was cooking, especially when Manu asked her about the temp etc of the beef she got all mathematical and ended up stuffing it up. I would hardly called the dishes (qualtiy) that she put up "Competition dish) Feel SO SORRY for her hubby, he must get so embarrassed by her comments and statement
Just caught up on the episodes - so enjoyable watching the interaction between Pete and Manu! Question, did the WA girls really create the choc pav recipe? Because I have been making those for a few years now using the recipe from Nigella Lawson Forever Summer cookbook - its really yummy. Not your traditional pav but it's a hit with all my friends and family. Oh Melanie - I think you need to get out from Tassie more
So MKR page lovers, what is on your Menu tonight for Tea? We are having Apricot Chicken with Rice, now dessert? I wonder if Manu or Pete would come over and cook us a Suprise Dessert???????????? Could u imagine that happening?
I feel sorry for Melanie's poor under the thumb husband! He is probably too scared to stand up to her. Did you see how she treated him on their cooking night?? How embarrassing!!
Am waiting with baited breath for Wednesdays results to be revealed on Monday night. I thought they kicked butt, but will have to wait and see. Should at least be 2nd or 3rd place. Congrats to the girl power teams on the show.
Hi there, Just making barszcz ( polish beetroot soup). I recon it must be 15 years since I last tasted it. Thanks Sammy and Bella for this brave choice and bringing back memories of childhood in Poland. Na zdrowie!
Mr Stewart, whatdya reckon that uppity sheila from Tassie is actually the headmistress from Summer Bay doing a bit of moonlighting?
melanie is a B^&ch!!! Makes me ashamed to say I'm tasmanian, I actually think she would whinge during a r$%t!!! "oh, i dont like that, thats not how u do it, thats not right!!" I feel soooo sorry for the husband!!!
Team 2 looks like an interesting bunch , The Hippie's , The Cops , Married Couple , Mum & Daughter and Mate's ..... Who will knock VIC TEAM 1 off there pedestall ?? ... :)
I hope melanie goes home cos everytime she comments she makes u feel like knocking her out! Lol she is just a biatch
watching the repeats this morning!!! i'm laughing and thanking Karma for coming around and biting Mel in the u know what!!! Practice what you preach woman!!! you can't cook prawns and eye fillet for peanuts!!! 
Melanie should go home, she makes my skin crawl, everything she says is negative. I feel sorry for the rest trying to cook
I love the show............I sit there some nights and want to throw something at the TV everytime Melanie ridicules anothers meal.....since when did she become a judge, I thought they were Pete & Manu. Makes me want to watch the show just to see her eliminated......
Goodness me there is some nasty comments on here :( Such a shame.
danella is sooo funny and melanie is so tackless i thought that those mushrooms would have been awesome i hope kane and lee pull through
Just started watching mkr really enjoying the show , only thing i don,t really like is how judges get to eat the food and give their views before the others i wonder if it can change some of the contestants views
OK so its Sunday night and I am making chorizo stuffed mushrooms with Buffalo Mozarella !!! Fingers crossed they turn out as great as the "competition" dish on the show
Love the show! Very entertaining!! dont know which team to go for..but i do like the girls.. sammi and bella! as long as mel and her husband dont win.. i'll be happy!.. and i would like to know.. how is it fair that when mel and her husband were cooking.. he was hardly in the kitchen! hardly seems fair on the other contestants! 
Best of luck to all the new teams !!!!! bring it on :-)
I just went and seen the two Tassie teams compete against each other today it was awesome
CAN WE PLEASE PLEASE NOW THE NEW WEEK HAS STARTED JUST ENJOY THE SHOW AND FORGET MEL AND THE HATE COMMENTS AND ENJOY THE COOKING
Go Team 2 VICTORIA show these Inter-Stater's how We do it ....... Go MELB STORM Lol 
I just watched a bit of today tonight, :S
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE MEL HATE POSTINGS...HOW PATHETIC ARE PEOPLE????? IT'S JUST A SHOW OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT REALLY NEED TO GET A LIFE!
i love this show and no one should be bagging anyone as its all for fun people have to rember that
I love this show, can't wait until their in an unfamiliar kitchen and the comp really begins!
wondering if anyone saw 'today tonight' with Mel and James and wondering if anyone may have had a 'change of heart'......seriously guys, they are humans, 'real' people, how bout lay off the insults and just enjoy the show. After all, MKR is all about food, watching people create beautiful dishes, its not about hatred and nastiness......enjoy tonights show :-)
Mmmm duck! Yummo!!!
I LUV Mel N James....Go You Good Things!!!! :) Goodluck to the New Tassie Girls :)
media will always create drama and feed off comments. don't get sucked into it, just watch the show, enjoy and understand how they film is to create drama and RATINGS !!!!!!
Looking forward to round 2!! Best of luck to all the teams :)
The tassi woman seriously needs to come down to earth and perhaps stop whinging about every single thing. She should learn to like and appreciate others hard work and say something nice about the food they cook. Everyone will like her then!! Unnecessary smile everytime wont help!! 
Once Again Im disappointed with the victorian Team :( cant u find any good cooks from Victoria ?
Very pleased to see some Recycling Shopping Bags on MKR... Thanks Urban Hippies for reminding us... MKR should have it in the rules "lets consider the environment" 
Is it just me or does Mal from QLD look like he is out of Revenge of the Nerds LMAO
Shame the dishes didn't come together well for Qld, the menu sounded lovely. I love cooking for people but definitely wouldn't want to have to do it under pressure. On a better note, my Valentines dinner has been delicious! Hope everyone else who cooked for their loved ones/families or just themselves had a lovely evening! 
just made Daniela and Stefania's choc pav dessert from last week. Wow!! Thanks guys, that was awesome!!!
Well I think that the whole of group 2's personalities need some serious seasoning they all come across as very bland bring back GROUP 1
I love MKR, all the (future chef's) doing the best and believe me every food we see them cook on tv looks so yummy good on them for doing there best : )' Would'nt it be nice to have some Indeginous couple on the show, (crocadille, camel, emu meat just a few) , bush berries, & herb's Etc. Just a thought maybe another MKR show lol.. The show is awsum, loving it : )'
Ducks are extinct in Tasmania?
Just watched sunrise and good on Mel and James for coming on and being graceful to all the hurtful remarks that have been made about them. I agree with Manu and Pete it is disgusting to read what people are saying.It is time to let it go.
The mother and daughter team??????????????????
I love the couple from Hobart. Melanie, don't worry about what others say and just ignore the hate mail. I love to cook and would love to have an outsider critique my cooking although I would not be able to apply for the show, it would be a humbling experience to have others points of view. Apart from family and friends where you would be unsure if they were being kind or not. After all, it is just a game and if other viewers can't handle someone giving an honest opinion then all they need to do is change the channel
Calling Alfred Stewart :) How did your VD dinner go? Did you take down to the boat shed for a romantic walk?
Come on.. it is a tv programme designed to evoke viewer emotions in which will gain a larger viewing audience! (and lots more votes for CH 7) - tv manipulation at its best thanks to the wonderful MKR editing team!... I enjoy the show - i don't forget it is a cooking competition either!!... Go Group 2 !!! :)
looks like that 'hate' page for Mel has been shut down...pleased to see that. At the end of the day it doesn't matter how nasty Mel's been portrayed, no one deserves to be treated with such spite and hate. It's pretty un-Australian...I'm all for constructive criticism, but some of the stuff written was just way below the belt.. Lets all just get on with the show and keep the comments a little nicer cause it makes coming on here pretty ordinary. 
From the Tassie MKR Womans hate page I have contacted today tonight and 3aw to see if Mel will part with her appearance fee's so we can donate them to the flood victims on all of our behalf. This way we can turn the 'hate' into real help for those that need it. What better way for Mel to show atonement for so many nasty comments. Any media enquiries can be sent to tasmkr@gmail.com 
Personally I enjoy MKR however, Tasmania has failed to impress me with their attitude. It's true, critiquing the food is an excellent way to improve the dish, but there is a big difference between critiquing and "Bitching". I feel that all the dishes served in G1 were of a restraunt quality and did not require Tasmania's rude mannerism, especially when their food was of poor quality. I am hoping that the Tasmanian's in G2 will be a little better and much more polite than in G1. I look forward to seeing all of G2 instant restraunt.
MEL (weird name, what's it short for?) Is so cute and handsome. His girlfriend Bec is so lucky to have him. The girl who stands up for ducks, I liked the way she stood up for ducks - if I had a boyfriend who hunted ducks I would dump him as well! I just don't understand why the contestants cook things they've never cooked before, or why they don't do trials with friends or family first before it's their turn? 
noticed a few people have mentioned 'Native Australian berries etc'. I use them throughout our menu at our restaurant, and YOU can too :-) I was really surprised the other day to see our local Coles has Finger Limes stocked! i normally get them flown down from QLD. If you want to try a little bit of native Aust. Get your hands on some, they look like caviar, varying in colors from pink to green and you can use them on top of natural oysters to give them a really nice zing.! or, put some in your gin and tonic instead of normal limes. Just a thought :-) and no, not a plug for Coles, just surprised me, and made me happy that they are starting to get some Aussie bush food in their fruit and veg dept. 
What ever happened to the overall dinning experience! I havent heard any of them comment on that. Restaurants are not only about the food. Good luck to team 2.
Here we go again with the quick judgements ,i'd like to see the 10 worst commentators (hard to choose) in a cook off. Anyway,being an old hippie, i loved their boho theme and thought they seemed very nice.i wish Mal could pass on his calmness to me. 
I can't believe, Im doing another year of MKRs....I really didn't want to this year...but I can't help it :( It just grabs me in :)
Straight up, I love the QLD couple. Seem like all round good cooks & extremely nice, easy going people. I'm not liking the daughter from the Mother & Daughter team - SNOB & so bitchy! Haven't made my mind about TAS or VIC yet on their personalities, everybody else I like :) All the best to them all!
Crap have to go to a seminar tonight which i can't get out of im going to miss the vic team does anyone know when the repeats are on ?????????
lmao just watched episode 5 ... tassie couple! think its funny the only things that scored them points is what the husband did ! but she thinks he is hopeless..
I made the stuffed mushrooms last night, with portobellos and I used sliced bocconcini and didn't have parmesan which I thought I had, :/ so used some cheddar and it was really delicious, very simple dish to do as well. If you like mushies give it a go!
I am not really sure about this new series of my kitchen rules it's not as good as the first series however, I only like 3 of the 1st teams being NSW, SW & WA
My fellow Rowvillians.....Go Team Victoria...Rock It!!!!
This team has some tricky dishes wonder if there competent in doing it
i vote for a rule change i think its unfair the judges say wats good or bad about the dish first i believe they should stay quite and let the others judge for themself that way we will really see whos kitchen will rule cause frankly i think half of them dont have a clue and just follow off wat pete and manu say...................
Holly - you're almost thirty. Quit acting and talking like a 14 year old spoilt brat.
Poor Kelly n Ash :( blame it on the lamb lol
I love how the other teams who haven't gone yet rate themselves so highly...until they get in the kitchen!
Holly is driving me up the wall. Little miss knows everything, "eaten in restaurants around the world, i know my food" doesn't even know dinner table etiquette, she eats with her fork upside down for goodness sake. someone shut her up and teach her some manners!
What the hell is with so many people's obsession now with rare meat? Let me make something clear. If you're eating meat, and it's still got blood in it, that makes you an ANIMAL! Human beings cook our food! Even the Aboriginals could muster enough sense to cook their food. Give me my meat WELL DONE! I want it CHARRED!
I must say both NSW teams are great, have a sense of humor and are lovely. so proud of them both *thumbs up" GO NSW!
Just finished in Aelaide Well done Kelly and ash deserved better scores 
LOL Manu loves his salt :P
holly is a pretentious little smarmy upstart!! If you have travelled all over the world and eaten im so many locations over seas then you would think that you would be a little articulate. And her mum is does look old and mutton as lamb. Perhaps her and her mummy spend all the time together cos no one else can put up with then how high maintenance would they be!! She annoys me her mouth and all.. Way she speaks.. Can't wait to see how she cooks! Sorry i just don't like her! 
I so want that dessert!!! Had something similar last year at Aria in Brisbane and the sweet and salt flavour in the peanuts is heavanly devine!!! :D
Holly , you come across like a spoilt little rich kid that knows it all @ age 26 . Pffft ! ....let's see how you go in the kitchen !!!
Nothing better than great food with a beautiful glass of wine, sitting around a table with fantastic friends; now that's what I call living !!
Holly has the table manners of a gorilla. If her & mummy have been to so many restaurants around the world, I'm just wondering which restaurants Maybe just maccas or the like
Thank God the lamb was dead last night. It was a baaaaaaaad experience
looks like Ash is going to be the male version of Melanie. oh well you have to have them sort in each round... can't wait for tonight to see what he does with the girls dinner
my father earns six figures and he drives an early 90's mitsubishi....what car you drive doesnt always reflect your achievements 
i just dont understand WHY do these ppl try things for the first time on the show? do they WANT to fail? and i dont know why the VIC ppl last nite didnt just put the lamb back in the oven to cook more? there is nothing u can do for over cooked meat but if its under cooked u can just put it back in! they would have rathered wait another 10 mins than get served something inedible!!
and just have to say i absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Manu!!!
I'm just watching Monday night's episode - did anyone else think it was wrong that when that guy said he had "issues managing his anger, they showed him sharpening a knife? It made him look semi serial killer...
I am definitely getting more emotionally charged as the series progresses. My kids were arching their eyebrows each time I sighed or said 'oh no' or laughed at the NSW boys. I am sitting on the edge of my seat when Manu & Pete start analysing a dish and look as tho they are going to say something negative then break out into a smile and rate the dish high! By the end of the season I might need a debrief and a therapist :)
Manu is such a honey! Just love that elegant French accent
Well! Ladies & Gentlemen, I'm off like a lamb to the slaughter, lol
I keep expecting Holly to stamp her feet and scream "I want a pony! I want a pony NOW!!"
Rub me in salt and feed me to Manu baahahaaha
I'm liking the school mates Bill & Alex, they look like a couple of fun guys. Looking forward to when they cook for the night. 
It amazes me to think that last nights couple would think that a rack of lamb would be cooked after only an intial 15 mins in an oven that was probably only on 190 degrees, at work i run my ovens on 250 and after 20 mins a four finger rack is just med rare, dont do dishes you havent done before, like the tea smoked duck, do something you know well, and also for the ppl going on about rare meat being dangerous to eat, beef is best cooked med rare, chicken, fish and pork are a different story, but lamb and beef are more favoursome and tender that way.
I'm loving round 2's contestants!! Last night was great - the Vic team handled themselves with dignity and grace in rocky terrain. Reinstores some faith in human empathy, after a troublesome round 1 :) 
wonders whether Manu has too much salt in his food. He has commented a number of times that there is not enough salt, yet no one else mentions it. You know it's bad for your heart Manu?
The Melbourne Couple - just too cocky. Should have let that lamb sit for a little more and they would have done well. But lets say they were like their lamb - very underdone!
Anyone know where Mal and Bec bought their Duck Breast. Have looked everwhere in Brisbane for it ?
CAN ANYONE HELP??!!! i recognise bec from somewhere and can't figure out where i know her from. i'm unsure if i know her personally or if i've seen her on some other show, or an ad or something like that. it's driving me MAD!! does anyone even know her last name? that might even help!!!!
Noticed the long wait between courses is a bit of a Collingwood Tradition '' like premierships'' ..but I noted he didn't have to Hot Wire the Car to go shopping nor did they serve the traditional Magpie tucker Hot Dogs and Meat Pies so maybe they are new recruits to Lock it in Eddie..........
Vic needs to learn how to cook lamb!!!!!
just watched last nite episode :( too bad I'm not Bear Grylls from man vs wild probably I will eat that raw lamb but their peas ragout, mushroom and dessert definitely gonna be on my cooking list, they looks yumm especially the parfait!
It amazed me the couple last night couldnt cook lamb when there entree and dessert were beautiful. Back to the drawing board with mains.
Anyone know, are the houses hired or real homes of the teams? Sammy and Bella's home looked sparse like they hired an empty home.
If the package says it is roasted peanut with no added salt. does it mean its salted already?
GO KELLY AND ASH- You are what Victoria stands for-and plus, u go for the best team......GO PIES!
Why are these girls questioning the scallops??? You'd think they would have done the dish a thousand times before...wouldn't you have practiced this?? Crazy? Or is it just me? 
Ginger beer??? What's wrong with champers???
"I have never had any scallops with their roes on in any restaurants in WA."..Didnt u say u have travelled the world??!!!
Did anyone see that moles face....when the Judges said they liked the scallops......she look so dissapointed WTF
Does "Princess" Holly annoy anyone else or is it just me? And what makes the Victorian couple high achievers, they just seem to have regular jobs dont they?
Why didn't the mother teach her child how to use cutlery on their voyages around the world to all these restaurants? 
Love watching MKR.....am hoping that the Tasmanians in this show do well....I say cook the scollops with the roe on, if its not liked it can easily be cut off....One thing I DONT like is the fact of Mal sits at the table with his hat on, come on...totally rude to do so..and mother and daughter contestants...seems to me that the daughter has more tongue than her mother...annoying...yes she is
Ash, you sound like a typical Collingwood Wanker!!! 
I love the grimace on Kel's face when the judges loved the WA girls' dessert...hehehehe 
Does anyone else think that Holly kind of looks like a naughty little girl? (not in a sexual way... perverts lol) It's just something about her face. haha I think I like her but I think she needs to keep her freaking elbows off the table!
is it me or do you think all the other teams are scoring low? just because the comp is heating up?...... 5s and 6s - they should be ashamed of themselves!! jealousy!
Great desert Tassie Girls I would have liked the lot of it cause I love cheese I think they went great !!!!!!!
Are there some hard-to-please people in group two? Or maybe they're just true foodies with high expectations thus the low scores? I actually think everything looks yummy and beautiful. The best so far, in my opinion and one that I'd really like to eat!
obviously the producers are making kelly and ash out to be the bad guys in this batch of contestants. Serioulsy editors think about the ramifications for the people you put through this, whilst you're anonymous and cutting up a storm the people you're singling out have to deal with the consequences.
holly eats like a pig...and her...eccentic...look...annoys the crap out of me...theres just something about her i dont like
Don't like the new groups stratagies it seems more about the game then the taste, harsh on the girls I think it should have stayed with just the first lot??? otherwise have been enjoying the show
is it just me or Mal is really annoying??? I cant stand him..even Holly had something nice to say.
OMG Where are their manners ?? Mal, get your hat off at the table and Holly, take your elbow off the table while swinging your spoon in the air.
dear ash yes i agree dont just wait on dessert how ever u butt monkey who r u to bag anyone out when u clearly cant cook cause who sends out raw meat!!!!
Ok , Qld an Vic teams very nasty an jealous!!! As for wearing a hat at the dinner table absolutely disgusting an sooo rude!!! Also elbows on the table ! 
Congratulations Girls, lovely to see a team so thankful of their scores, and well deserved!
would love to see what the NSW boys come up with.. lol they look like fun dudes, but so unorganised haha.
I heart MKR!!! Totally! Despite the hoo hah :D 
go tassie girls unreal well done hahaha ash and kelly u butt monkeys belong on the bottom how does it feel!!!!! may be u would like a banana instead of the mousse.
Team 2 is far more catty and clawy than Team 1!! :-(
sorry to all our friends in WA..... maybe if you don't look @ this website B4 u view the show u won't be disappointed. Excuse us from the other states but we get sooo excited with each show we just have to post!!
This second group seems to be playing the game, the first group were more genuine in their responses. Game or no game, being genuine will always win. 
Harden Up Ash! You might not have liked the meal, but atleast they serve RAW MEAT! LOSER!!!!!!!!!
Everyone is bagging the Victorian team but I think the Qld couple are more sinister, they are just quiet about it. To give the Tassie girls a score of 5 must be strategic. I wish the head hippie would take his crusty cap off - I heard he has alopecia (but seems quite hairy on the side) - is probably worried a roach will fall onto his plate. I thought the Tassie girls did a great job with what they served, however, vegies were sorely missed.
Kelly and Ash are just so awful ... sore losers, go get a life guys !!
oh fork me ash and kel.. Nasty nasty nasty.. They want to show they playing game hard core. Not influenced by desert, that's how they got their points last night. Lmao what a joke that pair are! 
OMG !!! How bad is group 2 with their digusting scores. A 5 from the hippies ???? There is NO way that deserved a 5. They should hang their heads in shame with that score. And as for Ash & Kelly ... those two are nitpicking nasty pasties ! 
I thought hippies were all about love and peace! com'on where is the LOVE!!!! 
More Sour Grapes with that anyone...?"@!?
Just catching up on this weeks shows (recorded them!!) WA daughter-Holly is strange!! Couldn't believe it when she said she was 26-she looks and acts about 12!! NSW guys seem to be a laugh. Again the QLD guys are lovely :) Not sure on Tassie girls...just about to watch them cook now :)
FB seems to be playing up So Well done Tassie Girls you did great had the dinner Guests from Hell where are their Manners........ shame on them !!!!!
Holly, please come to my place so I can teach you some table manners. You treat your knife and fork as though you were conducting an orchestra. When you want to talk, put them down first, fork crossed over the knife. Do not twist your fork when putting food in your mouth. It's really unpleasant to watch. I'm happy if you bag other contestants - that makes for good viewing in my opinion - but lazy, inadequate table manners don't. 
I think Peter and Manu shouldn't say anything at first when they receive the dishes and make everyone wait as though they say it at the end anyway, plus it can make the contestants think worse of their dish before they eat it. Just wait til the end of the night then they should say how they feel about the dishes and give their score as normal.
not believing the scores the girls got from the other contestants..i think the hippies are trying to stay up the top and ash and kelly they are just trying to make themselves feel better about totally messing up with there crappy raw lamb!! come on people is this not a show were you should be fair with your scores?? and P.S i think they should score them on whats on the plate not what they would preffer is on the plate!!
Melanie looks like mother teresa tonight against Kelly and Ash. What complete pigs...just because they screwed up doesn't mean they have to chuck a tantie.
Im just loving all these nasty comments about Ash and Twinkle toes Elbows know it all!! I really think the Newlyweds are a nice couple.. they have not said a nasty word yet, they have judged everyone fairly! well done newlyweds for having alot of class!
What is with those low scores?!?!!? at least round 1 contestants are honest these people are just awful....you get a 7 for serving raw meat, a 7 for dessert being 2 hours late, and a 5 for your main being a tad dry....WTF??
because i like chicken and baked beans and someone else dosent would i get a lower score because they dont like it? lmao (DRAMATISATAION)
Holly I am quite sure you would look far more attractive if you went a la naturele but as it is you resemble a badly made up clown. Ash and Kelly should be ashamed of themselves, Ash pretending to choke on what, possibly his poor taste comments or his drooping bottom lip. Please hippies be fair, you have scored 5 2 nights in row, your game plan is quite obvious and certainly not working. Congrats to the Tassie girls on a job well done and taking the lead.
I can't believe the girls didn't score higher tonight, at least they didn't serve rawmeat! Ash is a little angry man with no cooking skills, can't wait to see him loose (imagine the temper tantrum then!)
I like it alot very interesting in away some things are a bit strange but overall something I would go in to fight for NSW. Something that I can prove apart from living with Autism and deafness but I don't care something that I dream and live.
I knew it again the screw ups are victoria (sad much haha no go SA) and what do you know instead of handling their mistakes like decent human beings & trying to enjoy the rest of the instant restraunts they pretend every1 else sucks reguardless of the quality of food b4 them. Theres competitive then theres complete wankers. I hate ppl who step on other ppl to make themselfs feel better its not high school grow up at this point they deserve their place and i hope they stay their.
 l just recieved this in my messages l have no idea who this matthew eaton person is he is ruded and disgusting and should grow up. Matthew Eaton Matthew EatonFebruary 17, 2011 at 4:10pm Subject: wankers tassies are always wankers why do u think nowone wants to visit take all the gays blacks put in tassie then close all transport out.. Let you all die from aids u scum pigs 
hopes that Team Vic are at the bottom after the first round. and then go on to lose the elimination against the team from group 1.
Last year OK we all hated Mel from Adelaide.....we boo hooded Ronan bless his cotten socks for killing a fish............. but it was more to do with the cooking there was lots of pics of the dishes good or Bad...... can we get back to what the show is about
To Kelly and Ash........please leave you are a pair of sour puss's. How on earth you scored a 70 after serving up raw meat is beyond me. Tas girls......you deserved more than just a diff of 2..........at least your meat was cooked!
Great job Tassie girls! Great local produce inc Ashgrove Cheese. Yummo
I thought the girls did extremely well tonight.....well done. As for Ash, what was that little pretend choking cough that he did after eating the entree...what an a**hole!!!!! Holly still needs to learn manners at the table...those elbows!!!! Mal please take your hat off at the table.....extremely rude!!!!
MOLLY- Didn't your mother ever teach you to leave your elbows off the table when at a dinner party!!
I can't believe that guy from last night said, "I think it is really important to mark the evening on all the meals not be blinded by a good dessert!" Well mate the only reason you got the score you did was because people thought of your dessert (the one thing you didnt cook) as opposed to your raw main. Dick!
OH EM EFF GEE! Mal from Queensland (The Urban Hippy) Get your fricking hat off, when you're at the god damn table! If you're ashamed of going bald, if that's the case, then get a wig, but take you bloody hat off! And The girl from WA. You may be a short ass, but take your bloody elbows off the table! Miss, I'm a high standard of person, take them off, it is rude and disgusting...and learn some eating etiquette. 
: To the coppers: Esther & Ali, well deserving of your score tonight of 72, I thought you girls did well with your food. To Ash: I was taught to eat everything on my plate except if it the meat was RAW! Stop being a sour puss & learn to give credit where it is due. Bring on the boys tomorrow night. 
GO ASH, play the game the way u like and the way u taste it. Yeah the lamb coulda been cooked a little more but hey, those cop's forgot vege's, like seriously !!! & how hard is it to make bloody frozen raspberries with gelatine in a tin ??? my 5 yr old daughter could do that with some slight instruction...
was Nasty ASH sitting on a pineapple ?!?!?!?! Well done Tasi Coppers
I think the girls did well tonight but the petty comments and rude behaviour of the other contestants really spoil the fun of watching MKR. They need to learn some manners from Pete and Manu ! 
Maybe Ash and Holly should get together, FIGJAM I talk the talk but um we are pompous pricks. 
Mel and James (Group 1) to go...listen to the videos of the interviews with Mel and James on Today Tonight an Sunrise...to quote Mel, 'when we were on the show..' as well as an interview with Kane and Lea on the MKR set (does this mean they are still in)...
I agree with u all. Watching Ash, the alleged professional was difficult. I think if I was on the show, I'd try and remember the pressure I was on and unless you get perfect scores, well ur not perfect. I'd imagine with pressure of work, cooking at that level is amazing. Wish I could have eaten that desert tonite too;)
Just loved Ash's fake cough....and the punching of his chest for added effect...lol...didn't see anyone behave so rudely when YOU served them up raw, fatty lamb Ash...get over yourself....
Good on the girls! I was fretting for a moment that they were going to get a lower score than either the "urban hippies" or the raw lamb servers, which would have been outrageous! I believe they deserved higher than 72 though, maybe a 75 or higher.
The couple from Melbourne are definitely getting pissy about things aren't they? She's reaching for things to find wrong with a fine dessert and he's clearly feeling weak and emasculated for coming last. No excuse to play dirty though.
For the record, i'm LOVING that this page has got nice again...if you want a good laugh, go have a look at the 'other' page.....i reckon they all need to be sedated over there! LOL
Ash talked the talk but he didnt walk the walk more like the walk of shame tail between his legs with that Fake cough LMFAO at him hehehe
so not aussie like ash! very sad to see that! i think the girls did so well last night i think they shouldnt know the scores until the last team finishes their dinner party, then maybe they would score better and stop being so nasty and katty sure wouldnt like to b their friends in real life
My mouth started to water last night when I saw the Ashgrove Cheese......the best cheese ever!!!!!!!
The fake cough by Ash was hysterical, next time he might really choke and you know Ash the cops from Tassie just might be the ones to save you. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones but wait... you already threw yours so now your getting wet in the rain.
omg as a victorian i am soo disappointed with the MKR teams from my home state.... the two teams here on show arent a true reflection of people from the state of victoria... and ash really needs to get a grip and be a man and stop trying to bring everyone down.
I think i would have hated the TAS Girls entree and mains, but that rasberry dessert looked yummy!!!
i think the groups left next week will be the better ones but i still think tassy deserverd more then 2 points ahead just for skill and knowledge i beleive play fair win fair well done qld that's the spirit no sour grapes in our state....
It's a bit disappointing but this year's competition seems to be more about a grab for $100,000 than about a genuine love of producing quality food - and as such, the mediocrity is shining through... ...and I think some of the scoring is a bit unfair/unrealistic - 5 for the Tassie girls, Queensland?!?! come on, surely it was better than that!!
I can't believe they let a troll into the second group, what next we are going to have Beer Battered steaks? 
If anyone actually wants to discuss the food in this show, I'd love to get your ideas as to what vegetables (or sauce) you would have served with the meal made by the Tassie women. I thought the entree would have been a good time to add some vegies to replace the 'cheese ball' - but what would you have used instead?
Is it just me or have the Qld "Hippies" been dragging out 'Mr Nasty' last 2 nites? scores of 5 both nites?????
Didn't like the fact they didn't supply them with any wine or champagne, the guests looked disappointed with that. 
the "hippies" are not really living up to the hippy "peace , love and mung bean" mantra - i think they must be pseudo hippies...
not sure group 2 melbourne couple are really doing us Victorians proud.. they seem to be just sore losers because their main was no good and all they seem to do it pick holes in everything even if maybe there was nothing wrong?????
I thought the comment about the donuts for dessert from Ash was a bit rude, give the girls from TAS a break...
To remove or not to remove that is the question?????........ If the hosts carry guns then you eat scallops the way THEY SAY!!! ..... I agree with leaving the scallop whole ........ It would just as insane as eating sugar free chocolate ...... would of liked to see some greens on the plate ........ all that cheese will make you not poop for a week ..... 
those QLD hippies are really harsh! especially considering their nite was a bit of a disaster!!!
As usual awesome show, now people here have got to realise, the producers have cut many parts out to make it entertaining, they are all just normal people having a go, and theres already been a winner, so lets kick back and enjoy with constructive KIND comments, as all the contestants can read whats here, and everyone has feelings! PS I love Roe
i would love to see people with disabilities or Deaf people cooking on the show or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders too, be awesome to see variety apart from nastiness which upsets my kids because now they think they can be disrespectful at the table...and they get to answer to me as their mother
It's very disappointing that some teams are not honest with their scores. I hope that they do it for the benefit of producing the best food from the most deserving team. A good chef takes a challenge positively, it's all about creating the best from their passion in cooking and not from pulling another chef down by giving unfair remarks. 
So what would eveyone's menu consist of? Mine would be: Scallop Risotto with Truffle Oil Lamb Rack with Chilli Mint Sauce a Sweet Potato Rosti and Wilted Spinach Black Forest Macarons
they need to change to scoring on MKR of course the teams that are losing are going to score the lowest so they don't get kicked off the show??
Whats going on with the Vic contestants?? We are suppose to be famous for our food. So disappointed. Pull up your socks both teams. 
What makes Ash and Kelly "high achievers"? Being Collingwood supporters with a job!
oh and I want the recipe for the peanut brittle parfait : )
im appealing for help AGAIN! please someone tell me where i know bec from or at least can anyone tell me her last name? bec from qld 28, is not helping me!! i don't know where i know her from and its very frustrating!!!! 
I think that the Judges should leave their comments until everyone has eaten... the teams copy and say the same thing as Manu and Pete ...lol Oh its too dry, not enough sauce blah blah blah.... People think for yourselves ...lol 
Tried holding my cutlery like Holly at dinner last night to see just how much control she has over her food....Nil. Sputtered red sauce everywhere! And I felt 5 again...
To the "High Achievers" you just sucked one lemon toooo many ......sour pusses!!
I know its been said before, but just have to record that I have never seen such appaling table manners as that young girl in all my days.
I think Kelly and Ash were scored too high.. How can you get a good score from a raw meal?? I'm thinking its rigged.. The other Vic team scored 59 and there food was cooked... Unfair much!!!
Could not believe what was going on last night with the coughing and complaining I think they should just grow up.To much nip picking we all c through that but i guess we luv that too.The show is fantastic cant wait till monday nite,my kids luv it too.
Tasmania has got to be one of the best seafood places in Australia ..And COP this they serve the cheapest cut of PORK.. really Girls back to the beat............
i tried making salted peanut brittle parfait for tonight, unfortunetly i have to freeze overnight. WTF . Kel and Ash made it in 3 hours. I wonder what their secret is. :(
In my opinion, the most dishonest team when it comes to scoring is the Brisbane team --Kane and Lee are too obvious in giving the least score because they are sooo scared to get eliminated. I dont think people will favor them with that kind of attitude. That's followed by the Victorian couple --will never forget that Ash who had to fake a cough in expressing his dislike of the food he is served. A raw lamb deserved more than a fake cough I reckon. 
i think the tassie girls should score higher than that! Their cooking is much better than Victoria's but since i am from WA, i am rooting for holly and her mum! Go WA!!! Make us proud just like Daniela and Stefania! hehee
I found this comment on MKR yahoo7 - You girls have got to be kidding! The plastic collar was still around the raspberry desserts that you palmed off as your own. They were obviously bought and stuck in metal cylinders (prices barcodes still attached). If you'd made them you would have known how to remove them from the moulds!..... i saw the plastic but assumed it was to help it all set!!!! ... NOOOOOOOOO we love the cops!!!!!
I just don't understand why these teams make a recipe or use a technique they've NEVER practiced before. I'd practice my whole menu for my friends before I did it on national TV.
I JUST MET PETER EVANS IN DARWIN!!! See Profile Pic! YAY ***STARSTRUCK***
I feel sorry for the couple in Tassie they dont deserve the treatment they are getting 
As a person who lacks any real culinary skills and would never have an opportunity to be part of a show like this....I wish I could be the "token taster" imagine being able to go to each contestants home and eat their food without the stress of competing!!!! Yes I know im dreaming!
You reckon if you, have your own meat, catch your own seafood or grow vegetables would MKR allow you to use it or you'd still have to buy it in? Would it be because you HAVE to buy your ingredients or because of possible food safety issues? I'm thinking the latter would be more the case.
Would somebody please tell the daughter in the mother and daughter team from WA that is is just plain bad manners to eat and wave cutlery around while you have your elbow on the table!!
IS congratulating the cops from tassie for cooking thier menu on the smallest stove in the competition!! it was just a plain old 4 burner stove.. cooking for 12 people, and in any kitchen.. that is to be commended!!
i hate the tassie couple. (not the cops). how can she turn her crooked nose up at everything everyone else cooks when her meat (what the HELL was that!?) looked like dog food. i want them to fail miserably. 
i just love this show :-)
We're roasting lamb on the bbq tonight, offcut bits that didn't make it to being chops, going to serve them with potato wedges, a salad of green beans, bocconcini and semi dried cherry tomatoes with a basil dressing and the last of a cob loaf cut thick and toasted smothered in garlic butter. What's everyone else having?
just scrolled down the page to see all the comments.. and bugger me.. since when has my kitchen rules been a real estate guide! lol, someone is trying to sell thier house on here! even if it does has 3 kitchens!! lol
Just a question... As many of us (viewers) watch it & love the dishes... Is there any possibility of there being a MY KITCHEN RULES cook book...?? I would buy it! Im sure a lot of others would too!
Kelly and Ash, not very nice...bad sportsmanship...so to speak...
every night is a cook off here its good i love it and i just started a course so it is even better i love cookin it is madd very passionate thing to do
Posts are all over the place , hours old, brand new, days old. My Facebook is stuffed !
Will it be a bumpy ride for NSW's Bill and Alex? Fasten your seat belts as My Kitchen Rules is ON NOW! (AEDT)
They've never cooked pheasant?!?! WHY would you do that! I just don't understand why some of these contestants attempt dishes they've never even done before!!!!
What goes in a cheesecake? .........cream?....Cream it is. Not that hard to remember!
Unfortunately being 'well travelled' does not bring u class or manners-just ask Holly...
OMG Holly... would be good while your spouting how well cultured you are that you were not clutching your champagne glass like a coffee mug!!!
did you see Holly take some of her mothers cheesecake while she was talking...how rude
Can they beat the other NSW's team?
you couldn't even "cook" a rack of lamb and you're critiquing their lack of skills to confit. huh?
i cant believe that ash was going on about how this was a great 3 course meal but he only scored them a 7! He just wants to get ahead im guessing.. 
How did each team score NSW? i missed it. Bloody ex husbands call at the wrong time.. haha
NSW Wooooo! Well done Bill and Alex!
well done boys!! Why did everyone underestimate you? I'm from Sydney & support u every inch of the way! PS. loved the dinner theme......up, up & away!!
Gotta Love Those Boy's!! And Holly was better tonight, so was Ash, nearly killed him and they gave a lower score, but he did compliment the dishes and the boys ! All round the game was laifted !
 Her travels probably only include RSL's in the western suburbs. No self respecting restaurant would let her in the door. She's tired, boring and clueless about anything not forgetting just plain rude and ofensive Bravo to the guys you did men and Sydney proud
Sue you tempt me to suggest the following we should all put together a menu for her..overcooked stuffed mushrooms with wilted lettuce, followed by Toad in the hole with ketchup and of course desert would be humble pie
With those sunglasses they looked a bit like Chippendale's!! (not that I've ever seen the real thing lol!)
WELL DONE Bill & Alex! Congratulations on a great score! Luv it how you just 'winged it'! : ) VIC Team are sore loosers should have scored the guys at least an 8! WTF was with that 7? Give it up already!!!!!
Ash says not confitting a pheasant leg is a big technical error? So is serving blood raw lamb ....
i missed the cheese cake, did it turn out ok? Go boys. :)
Well done boys, you rocked, I would have love to eaten all your dishes, the cheesecake looked yummyyy, I don't think any of us expected you guys to do well, but you did. :)
I just figured out what it is about Holly that irritates me the most.... practically EVERYTHING! She looks like a little girl who's been allowed to sit at the 'big table' and allowed to use the grown-up cutlery! lol
Well done Bill and Alex!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MKR BiLL & aLEx.....................Cool, Calm & Collective !
Wow! Way to go team NSW! Highly impressed by both of u keep up the good work !
well done bill and alex! loved all three dishes. great use of fillo pastry for the first course. you did us proud!
The boys did well, but holly keeps bragging about eating at all these restaurants sorry but maccas, hungry jacks and red rooster don't count!
I went to the official MKR Yahoo page and logged in etc, no Cheesecake receipe, When I typed in search it took me to a random receipe ! Please MKR The Boys Cheesecake receipe, I cant guess, cream cheese, sugar, cream ??
was screaming at the tv when ash said something about how they couldnt cook confit pheasant! U COULDNT COOK A RACK OF LAMB!!! what a dumb fker u are!!!!!!! Pot calling the kettle black!!!
love 2nite show will alex and bill they foods where amazing yummy and when they open the door on the polit outfit oh my so sexy hot ;) and alex is so dame fine well GO NSW!!!!!! so what u made of boys hope u go all the way now my thoughts are with use woohooooooo!!!!!! :D
God I wish that pretentious little girl from WA who thinks she knows so much about food being so well traveled learns some table decorum. she can't hold cutlery and the elbows on the table... my 3 year has better table manners.
If in doubt - just wing it! Well done to the boys from NSW, Bill & Alex, great food, great score of 86, love your work. You guys have definitely got balls ! PS: Looking good in your uniforms. Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away **** 
Go you awsome sexy boys .... Your not from my state but you did an outstanding job, you have fantastic personality's and are an alround near perfect package:)) You way outdid the excpectations i had already formed of a couple of blokey larakins, love an underdog getting up! Have to say i'll now be barricking for NSW; Team 2, if both SA teams go out! (cant b a traitor tempting as that is im far 2 patriotic:)
NSW boys you done well tonight.. Congrats on the "winged" Cheesecake!!!! Top score 86 :)
I just <3 Manu :)
The boys were great last night :) So funny to see how much Holly wants a piece of them - LOL!!! She was so giggly and flirty!! VIC are awful...I was hoping to see the back of Kane & Lee but now I'd rather see this couple GONE - high achievers - NOT!!!!!
Go the Boys. What a great job in the Kitchen. Shame about the confit pheasant legs. I was concerned when I saw them bubbling away in the fat!!!! Looking forward to seeing them cook again!!!
Well done Bill and Alex.. and here they were thinking you were no threat at all! Wish my partner would be more enthusiastic about cooking like you boys :)
Well done Bill and Alex. Great food. Loved the look of utter depression sickness and ' Im a looser ' on Ash's face !
Did anyone notice how Holly just shovelled some of her mother's dessert into her gob......and just kept on talking with her mouth full Kerry time to teach your daughter some manners
thinks the boys did a great job last night and shocked the hell out of the other teams. Lets hope that team SA & WA can beat the team VIC
NSW boys did great job!! LOVE the boys, Alex and Bill!:)x I will try to make their Blueberry cheesecake. so yummy!!! well done, 86 points!!:) 
If Holly is so well travelled and has eaten at soooooo many upmarket restaurants, I find it totally unbelievable that she has never seen pheasant on a menu....maybe she classes McDonalds as an upmarket restaurant...lol..
Wow well done NSW just saw it now had black out on sunshine coast last night.
How smooth were those guys last night - loved it!! Threw a real spanner in somes game plan :)
those boys from NSW were amazing!!! there food was off the hook...and they got real lucky with that cheesecake...the food looked soooo good
as i was growing up my parents raised pheasants so it was the normal sunday roast, no im not a great fan... my signiture mistake was once i cooked a roast for 6 ( yes pheasant ) ( i was 15ish) and decided to make the gravey healthy with wholemeal flour----you can imagine what it looked like, had to throw it out and make proper gravey 
it was good to see the hippies give other than a "5"...i believe other nights also deserved more than their "5"....
Today I read in this weeks Woman's Day that Mal from Qld began suffering alopecia just prior to the contest and was losing clumps of the hair on the left side of his head, which was why he was allowed to wear the hat.
Bill and Alex....Wow, what a great job. Well done to you. A few sore heads about that...oh well, only the best will suceed.
MKR has rubbed off in my house. I came home from work to a menu, the table set and a 3 course meal... made by a 10yr old(with Nannys help)...... thanks MKR for the inspiration. Pear balls with brie and mint leaves with a surprise (grapes) for entree. Shepherds pie and salad and...... Caramel tart with ice cream balls and a swirl...lol
Team SA is about to open their instant restaurant! And what has Manu hot under the collar? My Kitchen Rules is ON NOW! (AEDT)
i really like the car dealers fron south aust donna and reade i think their names are ? they seem nice genuine folks good luck
Think it will be with a heavy heart we all watch MKR tonight.........:-(
Will someone please put that "well travelled" spoilt brat on a plane.
Just saw an add for the AMAZING RACE....now im very happy !!!
Apparently young whats-her-name from WA does't like oysters, I hope I get to hear about it some more because I missed it the first 5 times.
I'm just wondering who is going to have the chronic farts tomorrow, or in 6hrs time after all the chilli etc tonight. Any wonder it's called a thunderbox. Congrats NSW guys for your achievement last night, cool bananas
OMG! Do these people EVER stop complaining ... "I dont like oysters, I dont like chilli, the gumbo's to wet, In MY travels to America it didn't taste like that!" Far OUT! Back stabbing, under cutting, elbows on table, disrespectful. Seriously bad sports alot of them. Getting tired of it now. Have to say liking our Tassie girls this time round, constructive critisisim goes alot further than sour grapes **hint hint to the VIC couple** !!!!
Does the inspiration for dessert come from Chef of South Park - Chocolate Salty Balls?
Why does she have to keep apologising to her husband? If he had helped her more they might have done better. He is soo unsupportive - what a donkeyhole.
Just started in Adelaide could that Holly Moan any more Lordy don't like oysters don't eat them and what is she wearing !!!!!
Hmmm Maybe if they'd served raw seafood they may have scored as highly as that other midget, Ash and his girlfriend??? And FYI . Mr Urban Hippie..... if you're 'allergic' to chilli I do believe an allergic reaction would involve a little more than just 'sweating', hmmm?
No way they were worse than Kelly and Ash tonight, even though I'm from Vic and live in Rowville too I dont like your arrogance Ash!!! you can't even cook a roast lamb shouldn't be on the show in the first place...
was pissing myself laughing at my hubby who was so close to jumping through the tv to give holly a smackin! He was wishing he could reach through the tv to ring her scrawny little neck!! i love a man whos passionate about a tv show!! lol and.. if kelly does that snide, sarcastic, nasty face pulling again.. im damn sure that my tv will be broken!! lol
Bloody awful, I would have given them a 5 ! Harsh I know, and I don't mind them as a couple ( despite the Babe constantly ), just didn't like the menu at all ! Maybe the prawn !
I don't want to sound "mean" or in any way "nasty", but if I saw that dessert sitting in a paddock I'd "step over it"!! Seriously, they looked like turds on a plate with a skid mark under them!!!! What on earth were they THINKING dishing something like THAT up???? They'd have been better off serving the balls as they were BEFORE they slaughtered them in the fryer!!!! Bad move guys!!!! On the upside, the gumbo did look nice and flavoursome, though the film of oil on top didn't look too good.
Glad to see that Kel & Ash are safe!!! As for their "facial expressions" that so many seem to find the need to criticise them for, have you stopped to think that they are keeping "poker faced" so as NOT to show the other teams how badly being on the bottom is getting to them (and stressing them), or how badly they are HOPING someone else gets a lower score than them??? Don't forget guys, this IS a competition!! Those who were "all smiles" were the ones who were already SAFE ... And now Kel and Ash are also safe!!! :-)
Um Kelly and Ash are lame, Ash is gay for sure, and Holly is a whinging brat, she wouldnt have a clue about good tasting food.
mediocre u say kelly, mmm yes dessert was risky.. But funny at least it wasn't raw meat they seriously shagged that neck, and the scores from those two.. And holly's mum see how she eats holly learnt something from her. 
Question... Is it in the rules that you have to eat everything served???? I can't stand Holly but... i hate oysters too, so i wouldn't eat them!! I wouldnt carry on about it though, I would just leave it on my plate...enlighten me someone :))
oh no...my soup it too wet...WTF? I'm allergic to Chilli is makes me sweat...WTF? Did they all take stupid pills before tonights episode?
lmao someone wrote the dessert looked like a cow pat.. And would step over it. But at least you didn't need to slaughter the lamb still from kel and ash. I wanted ash and kel on bottom not cos of how they cooked but cos of how they've conducted them selves since that! 
Thought sa would kick ass sadly i was mistaken! Tell me who doesnt know to dip those rice balls in egg not MILK , than bread crumbs! Ill take on all those teams and kick all there ass's ! 
Oh no now we have to put up with kelly and ash......seriously wanted them out they are just too nasty they arent being competitive they are being catty...... meow!!
To be honest, I don't like oysters either, unless they are cooked, so I can understand Holly not liking them, did anyone else notice SHE HAD A GO? seriously, does no-one remember Veronica from the first series who wouldn't eat the pigeon?? she woudn't even touch it! at least Holly had a go at it...
is it just me......or does Bec remind you of Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) from Home and Away?!?
Who the hell does this idiot Victorian (Ash) think he is - He critisizes everyone elses cooking as if he is an expert in fine dining and yet he screws up a very very simple lamb recepie. Moron
OMG!!!!!! I cannot stand Ash and Kelly.They really think they are so superior to everybody else. That face they both pull...snobs comes to mind. Need we be reminded that they served raw meat! and they have the hide to be so critical of everybody else. I cant stand watching them be so smug all the time. But I enjoy the show for all the others.
Question. Does anyone know if the contestants are asked if they are allergic to seafood before they sit down to a dinner full of it. Not very good if you are in a comp where the meals are full of seafood.
Nice couple AnnMarie & Nick but they did not cook fr. the heart tonight. I love oysters !!! Unfortunately you deserve your score. 
go the Sydney boys!! So nice to be in a kitchen without the pretence.... I'm having a go at their blueberry cheescake.. wondered if anybody has tried making it from the recipe and if so....how much CREAM??? 
Are these guys on the bottom of the table..Has just started here in WA
Holly, if you don't like oysters, don't eat them, slurp them, swallow them or however your suppose to get them down your throat (as you can read I don't do oysters either, haha), end of story! 
Hmmm, that is not nice Kelly to smile at other people's misfortunes .... no one smiled at your (not low enough) score for raw lamb .... not a good show of sportsmanship there ! 
Isn't it funny how an "obvious selection" of the contestants are so critical when it comes to judging, and low scoring to the other contestants on their 3 course meals, just to better themselves?? Why can't they just be honest and say the food their eating is great, rather than say for eg: "Oh I've had it better else where". Seriously, you look like fools! Just be honest and say if it's good, or bad. In the end no one is better than anyone, whether your a 5 star chef, or not. Everyone is trying their hardest to do their best. After all it's not easy pleasing twelve people, plus an Australian audience. Good luck to all, believe in yourself! I love, love the show...
Ok MKR fans... so over the Holly bagging, just for something different... has anyone noticed that apart from being awesome cooks, ALEX & Bill are really cool, but hot at the same time?!? Keeps me watching the show, hope they win so I can go to their restaurant one day... good on you guys, love ya style!!! 
can you please eradicate contestants who don't eat oysters, chilli or rare meat?
How can Ash even offer an opinion when he served raw lamb?
Holly and her mother are both such pretentious and rude people. oh, can you tell us all AGAIN how 'well travelled' you are and how you've eaten at the 'finest resturants in the world'?? the way they speak about people, the snide and sarcastic comments; im sorry but how does this prove you're classy? A classy lady would never gag on an oyster in front of a table of people who are all eating. Anyone with manners (or a brain) at all would just politely decline. To me, she's just an immature attention seeker, that mother of hers has obviously spoiled her rotten, and taught her to be an elitist, snotty little brat! I can't beleive she's 26.. nice head band :/
Oh Holly I don't like oysters you SNOTTY little critter you should be used to slimy things going down your throat then.Bring on tonight what is your menu cucumber sandwiches and fairy bread?
BTW if Anne-marie said BABE one more time that freaking chocolate risotto icecream ball dessert was going up her freaking nose!!!!! and whats with everyones fascination with BALLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hahhahhahahhahaha
i was expecting Holly to gag on that oyster last night, i really thought she was going to cough it up & send it flying across the table - & by the looks from the others, i wasn't the only one...
TONIGHT 7:30PM: Who will be the first to go? Will it be SA or WA facing our first elimination? Find out in our 90 minute special tonight!
blahhh seafood
I just CANNOT believe that SA scored so low!!!!! A dessert that you have never tried before ... not sure if that is gutsy or plain silly :) Anyway still lovin' the NSW boys!!!!!
over the last two days of watching my kitchen rules i am sick of everytime they show ash and kelly talking saying they are on the bottom how many times a episode do we have to hear it, we know you are on the bottom we know why as you cant cook lamb 
Holly's table manners suck... The precious little snob boasts about being well travelled and fine dining, but she eats like pig... try chewing with your mouth closed for once... The oyster scene... totally unnessesary... Fine dining my arse.... she knows nothing about Table manners... she doesnt even look over 20 let alone act it...
How cruel can people be - Brissy guy has a medical condition so give him a break - women wears scares, this man feels more confortable - so i say leave him alone - he is polite and well mannered until some others.
First there were pear balls & last night they had risotto chocolate balls. Mmmm, I wonder if Holly & mother will balls things up tonight in the kitchen? I'm a WA girl so I have to say "carn mother & daughter", prove us all wrong & get in that kitchen tonight & cook up a storm ;) 
Dont think Mal is allergic to chilli....maybe he was worried the heat would blow his hat off !!!!!
found it hilarious when Bill said 'his balls were nice' & Alex responded 'frim to the touch' about the chocolate risotto balls (well I'm sure that's what they were both referring too)! BAAHAHAHAHAHAHA! What a pisser! What great guys! I hope they win!!!!! All the way NSW! ; )
anyone else dislike the word "gumbo" hahaha makes me think of a couple of hicks in small town America sittin on the hood of their pick-ups, chewing straw and shooting at cans lined up on the fence. Hope Holly and her mum... (Kerry?) fail tonight. Don't like her oh so important opinions. Also, think last nights dessert should have been left at a (small amount of) chocolate risotto served with vanilla bean ice cream. Would have been delicious. Really shouldn't be getting all creative on the night
I know I seem to be the minority, but I like Holly, yes she drives me flippin mental with her table manners, and my 15 month old daughter holds a fork better than her, and the way she carried on with the oyster was a bit over the top, but atleast she gave it a go unlike the sook Ash with his arancini ball in Tasmania when he refused to eat any of it. Holly isn't vicious either, she usually has nice things to say about the food she is eating, unlike the Vic couple who are just nasty, and Kelly constantly has a look on her face like a deer in headlights that's sucked on too many lemons
PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!!!!! - why oh why would you attempt a sweet that you have never done before in a competition?????.......... very silly indeed ....... And why would you wash as oyster in fresh water????? ....... GO WA TONITE!!!!!
The scoring is a little inconsistent! If my lamb was still Baa-ing at the table.. im damn sure i wouldnt be giving them a good score! it sucks that the couple lastnight never served anything raw.. and thier on the bottom of the leaderboard!! Please Ash and Kelly.. next time u wanna serve meat.. dont worry bout cooking.. just tie a bow around its neck and lead it into the dining room... lol
the tiem u get the carrots adn the fish and the sauce and the all the other stuff cost u about 30 bucks
i know for a fact i wouldnt make it as a cook...i hate seafood,,i heave at the sight and smell of it
should be intersting tonight,,mum and daughter team,,
hope mother and daughter crash and burn... their noses are too high in the air for my liking... Just sayin :p 
NSW is currently the best cook in the comp =D Sammy and Bella and Bill and Alex =DDDDD GO TEAM NSW 
I thought I'd seen the Gumbo recipe before. Jamie's America (Oliver) pg 98 Surf and Turf Gumbo. Still a kickin dish tho
Will WA's mother and daughter team Kerry and Holly struggle to stay calm in the kitchen? And who will be the first to be eliminated? My Kitchen Rules is on NOW! (AEDT)
OK so I may be wrong BUT.... does anyone else think that Kerry and Holly's little video montage at the beginning looks kinda like the opening sequence from The Bold and the Beautiful?? lol
Oh well ! The Karma Bus has just pulled up :-)
I want to slap holly so bad hey no need to the judges just did lol
Stick to being a well travelled spoilt brat....................
I hate to be ageist, but I think Kerry is just too old for this show. She would probably agree after being apart of it. Her nerves are shot amd has lost her ability to multitask and focus.
OMG will someone slap Kelly and Ash what critizers..... Nothing eva good enough... High Achievers !!!! of what whinging
ohh im so glad to see what her traveling around the world and expertise in food brought forward onto the plate LOOOOL seriously i dnt feel sorry for her at all!
omg, are these two for real, they can't even serve up anything nice so far, maybe they need to go a cooking school instead of traveling the world. 
Mkr has just started in s.a... & im loving all these coments.. Karma 2 holly 4 sure.. Lmfao
Can someone PLEASE drop off some Sara Lee Creme' Caramels to Kerrie and Holly's place??? ASAP! 
What a mess....'I don't think I have an ounce of energy left for another batch of creme caramel'.....bad attitude, if you want to win that is :)
Kerry and Holly ... BAHAHAHAHAHAHA Karma just bit back 
Why wouldn't you just scrap out the burnt ones and re-use the same ramekins? 
I thought Kerry and Holly were supposed to have eaten in all the best restaurants and have the best knowledge of food and cooking. Well it hasn't shown in their kitchen tonight! Holly is so annoying and I just want to slap some manners into her! DRAMA QUEEN!!!!!!!
If Holly had been mine I would have put her over my knee a long, long time ago. I'm enjoying watching these two tonight and I'm laughing all the way :) Nice to see them with a little creme caramel on their faces lol
holly: "mum, what is it? what is it?" kerry: "the creme caramels are in there holly thats what!" hahaha
Oh dear! What are these two doing tonight?! I watched their intro video today and they were bragging about how they could cook creme caramel with their eyes closed! Maybe if they had done that tonight - it would have turned out!!!!
I couldn't even enjoy their epic fail, it was just such a train wreck to watch. 
Holly and Kerry might be better at cucumber sandwhiches !
somebody should teach that Mal some manners. Does he not know to take his hat off at the dinner table. Disgusting
just starting here in Qld... hoping Manu slips some arsenic into Hollys wine lol
After reading all the comments about the WA team gosh i can't wait to watch this episode..is it that bad? really?
even in the cook off she is telling her mother what to do.....come on Holly.......seems to me though, they arent as good as what they reckon they are....
I know they have been annoying, and Know It All's, and table manners Atrocious , but I feel sorry for them. They have been funny to watch and make fun of, but they have feelings, they're not that bad are they? Ash and Mel annoy me so much more ! 
who the hell drains peas to see if they are cooked, then places them back in boiling water???????
I went to the doctors because I wasn't feeling well and he sucked blood out of my neck!! WARNING DO NOT go and see Dr.Acula... 
I hope the Vics fail, just to see miss prissy, fail later on. OOhhh im so evil LOL
Yummooo pork crackling!!!!! Go Team 2! 
How extremely rude was Mal to sit at the table with his hat on shame shame shame you rude little man
Go cook cheese sandwhiches
:) Happy Curry
Doof ... Doof .... That's the sound of the Karma Bus hitting Holly and Kerry!! Girls, you are the weakest link ... Goodbye! Congratulations to Kane and Lee for pulling it off tonight ... Now the heat is REALLY on guys, so time to BRING IT!!! Go Victoria!!!
Hahaha love it, just love it - Kerry & Holly, KARMA bit you on the bum and you scored a F minus hahahaha
How can she say her mum always makes those creme caramels??? every batch was stuffed up :S 
You have too be joking !! curry n rice beats a dish that is restaurant quality ?? If it only takes a curry ,I'll enter myself !! Joke Manu !?
Go suck those oysters Holly.... all the waiting paid off Australia.. YOU'RE OUT! looking forward to NOT hearing her freaking voice for the rest of the series... but on a sadder note ASH and KELLY are still in arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh :(((((
Last to cook and first to leave.... You can talk smack but when it all is said and done an you get kicked to the kerb please don't cry! At least Kane and Lee didn't make that red bean spew... i mean soup... i mean dessert :P
don't u just luv karma ahhh <3
How do you spell comeuppance again? Thank goodness little Miss Bossy doesn't have to be heard of again - until she starts whinging to New Idea or Today Tonight I suppose.
go kane & lee go team vic
KARMA - Holly you bagged nearly everyones food you put on an act of knowing everything about cooking presentation and flavours well well well its not only about those concepts it is also about the way you handle the stressfull situation in the kitchen. Go and watch your performance and have a look at how you spoke to your mother learn some respect young lady and take the chip off your shoulder and the plum out of your mouth learn some table manners and get over yourself !!!!!!!! 
The curry, coconut rice and sweet potato chips looked great, presentation was good too. I would be happy to be served that at a restaurant
so long little brat & mummy dearest! Ahahahahaha! Look who's having the last laugh now! Your culinary experiences across the world did you no justice! : )
Well WA for beening such a well travelled team I hate to say it but you girls sucked big time tonight, and you didnt listern to the judges and made the same mistakes in the cook off, 
Can't wait for next week's eps...I really feel like crackling now - looked sooooo good. Will miss Holly - found her to be highly entertaining and honest. As for Mal - love the hat...think it's funky and people should move on...it's about the food people :)
manu u big spunk (: Alex and Bill<3
OK Holly and the Mum did not do well Nothing to do with table manners Just not real good cooking they are gone now BULID A BRIDGE and lets get on with the show
OK, I'm a big fan of MKR but it seems to me that Pete and Manu were over Kerry & Holy as much as the rest us! How can a bowl of curry and a cup of rice beat PORK CRACKLING?
It's a shame how viewers have to have villains and heros. The shows video editing team are just showing us what they want to. Lets not get personal, when we don't know the context in which things were said, and just enjoy the show by judging the food cooked, and not the people cooking it.
Go Kane and Lee you good things! You are the better Victorian team by far. Can't stand Kelly and Ash. So glad you guys are still in and Kane you are such a cutie. Keep the good food coming guys!
OMG!, tonights episode was the BEST EVER!! i swear to god.. I was splitting at the sides with laughter!!! I must have looked like a laughing clown, cuz my mouth was open the whole damn show!!! And when the scores came out.. i think i got a stitch!!! Oh and my man... well every low score they said.. He let out a "BOOYAH!!" lol. Cannot believe how they Crumbled under the pressure!! Do they seriously think that they could run a restaurant! If i worked like that.. I'd be sacked in the first hour!!!
For Holly: Swallow your pride occasionally, it's non-fattening! ~Author Unknown 
Great show toinght :) Sad to see Kerry & Holly go...she's not malicious or mean, just comes out with some crazy things that make you cringe!! For all that she says she is well travelled, she actually comes across as being very naive. Wish them all the best. Lovely to see 1st Group back...had forgotten how lovely the cousins are from WA :)
Holly & Kerry, it was bit of a hells kitchen tonight at your place but as mum said you learn by your mistakes, you gave it your best shot. You guys did you well in the cook off, your food looked good. Holly, you still managed to laugh & smile but when you had tears so did I, I really felt for you. At the end of the day you guys were the chosen ones to leave, I wish you both well. 
WA was robbed tonight - how can a curry beat that pork - looked so professional..."well cooked rice but raw veges and flavour missing from the sauce" versus "spectacular pork" - wish they would cook at my home for christmas!
Im so glad Kerry & Holly got the boot.They were so rude at everyone elses instant resturant.And it seems that all the things they critisised others for doing they did themselves. I feel sorry for kerry her daughter walks all over her.
Who dressed Manu and Pete? They looked awful in those shiny suits. 
Hi Manu and Pete, just wanted to say what a great job you guys are doing... Was glad to see Kerry and Holly go as I dont think they have what it takes to win this competition, Am hoping for the S.A couple from group 1 or the Italian girls.. They are great!! Watch it every time its on, wouldnt miss an eppisode.. Kepp up the great work guys xx
Sad to see one of the teams go home. Kerry looked way too nervous, I think if she wasn't in a television competition she would have been in a better frame of mind and wouldn't have stuffed up. I loved the idea of Kerry and HOllys restaurant. It reminded me of A ROOM WITH A VIEW (my favourite movie/book), the opening scene where Lucy is dining with her aunt. Sweet. 
In my opinion I think Kerry & Holly didnt score aswell as Kane & Lee because they didnt serve up (as the judge's described) a "complete" meal - even though im sure the small portion of pork served up was perfectly cooked they had a habit of serving up mains meals with "abit of this and and abit of that" the elements on the plate seem to be working by themselves instead of working together - Kane & Lee on the otherhand nailed this aspect. 
would have preferred Holly and Kerry to Lee and Kane... they are much more entertaining.... i just marvel at Hollys antics and comments. Lee is not the nicest of people and i would have been happy for them to go last night.... still dont understand how the "high achievers"....( legends in their own lunchboxes) managed to score 70 while serving raw meat and nothing really outstanding...
The best team won last night. Travelers of the world dining here there ad every where plum in the mouth slipped on their backsides last night. Come on WA Italian girls you can do it. Even the boys were better than them. Said they could do better than the South Aussies well what happened!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It can only get better know. Remember listen to what the Judges say. They did not.
Just had a thought, Considering Ash has a anger issue... Hes gonna have to be on his best behaviour in MKR Headquaters! everthing he does will be on show.. not only to Aus.. but to his fellow contestants.... i reckon he'll crack... maybe we might see some pots and pans flying across the room! lol
Holly and Kerry didn't listen to the advice given to them by Pete and Manu at their instant restaurant. Kane and Lee, although not my fave pair (Lee kinda annoys me, that hair has got to come down!!!) cooked honest, wholesome food. Holly and her mum got all fiddly and complicated and filled their plate with oddities. The stuffed pork with some fab vegies and a potato stack with great fruity sauce would have worked wonders. How many times has Manu said "it needs salt" or "it needs sauce" or has Pete said "keep it simple, elegant". He's giving you the answers. 
Seriously that mal dude from the urban hippie couple has to be the new ambassador for guys batting above their average!
Getting some pork on ya fork did not save the WA ladies ........ that green curry looked sensational and I bet would of smelt pretty awesome and tasted yum ...... we still have one WA team left ........ GO WA!!!!!
i took this from the MKR forum page but wanted to share it with everyone ---lovely to see some posative comments peter n Posted 6 hours, 14 minutes ago Sign in to report this post. yes i am happy for lee and cane,i agree they struggle a bit in the kitchen but they seem like a pretty normal down to earth couple, the sort of people who you wouldnt mind sitting around a table having a meal and an evening with. There seem to be quiet a few nice couples in the competition, the butcher boys seem pretty relaxed, the tassie cops seem like nice girls, i love the polish sisters, they seem so humble and sweet, donna and read look like they would be a laugh at a dinner party, daniela and stefania, look like they would be loud and a great laugh too bill and alex look unpretentious. The way i judge their personalities is " would i like to go to a diner party with them " and the majority of the contestants i would say yes. 
Is it just me or are some of the people on here more rude and judgemental than the contestants their bagging?
love this show its getting better and better!!!! its inspired me to try out next season good luck to both SA teams!!!
Ok, I'm sprung. MKR is my guilty, commercial television pleasure. Now, is it me or does Manu's French accent get stronger the more he's exposed on television? The same thing happened to Gabriel Gate. He became so unintelligible he couldn't get a job on the box.
Wish MKR was on tonight...Biggest Loser gone to the dogs and I just plain miss the MKR gang!
Why isnt there no NT teams? We may not be a state but we are apart of Australia. I think next season there definitly should be. We have some amazing food to offer... (",)
It seems as though only the humble and unpretentious teams are getting through with success. 
i wonder why they cook things they have never tried cooking before like choc risotto balls..........
I am not having any luck trying to catch up with missed episodes this week on 7 website even though I have the latest flash player they just wont load-is it just me or is anyone else having the same problem?
Is it just me or did anyone else pick up this up. All the competitors prepared their table in the 3 hour time bracket. Holly's was all done before they went shopping. Interesting!!!!!!!
would someone in MKR please tell Mal that it is rude to wear a hat at the dinner table !!!!!! I always ask children whom visit my home to remove that caps inside, and I never allow them to have a cap or hat on while having a meal. I am not old or stuffy, its just manners. 
Can anyone tell me why do so many of the teams cook something they've never cooked before - I just don't get it??????
Just love Friday afternoons, these caption every week are a blast, i can't stop laughing at what people say.
LOVE STORY~~ A girl asked a guy if he thought she was pretty and hesaid no. She asked him if he would want to be with her forever and hesaid no. She then asked him if she were to leave would he cry, and onceagain he replied with a no. She had heard enough. As she walked away,tears streaming down her face the boy ...grabbed her arm and said You are not pretty you're beautiful. Idon't want to be with you forever. I NEED to be with you forever. And Iwouldn't cry if you walked away...I'd die... ~~THE END~~ .......Isn't that sweet? Tonight at midnight your true love willrealize they like you. Something good will happen to you at 1:00-4:00pm tomorrow, it could be anywhere on IM or email, outside of school,anywhere! Get ready for the biggest shock of your life. If you breakthis chain letter you will be cursed with 10 relationship problems forthe next ten years. If you post this to 15 pages in 15 minutes, you'resafe
i lovvvve this show!!!! Wish i could cook like Bill and Alex!!! They are awesome!! Go NSW!!!!!
So inlove with pete!!!! i just love he's facial expressions.....hottest guy on television at the moment i reckon..
Is looking for Something new to do with Mince, and chicken.. Anyone got any suggestions!.. and pleaseeeee not spag bol!!
Anyone seen Sunrise on friday morning? they had a "what went on Behind the cameras" on Wednesday nights show with the mother daughter team.... ??? Can someone tell me what had happened?
is the tea smoked duck done the correct way? i thought it wasn't/not sure?
I have never like reality T.V. muchand was wrapped whenBig Brother got the foul fuked, it use to prey on manipulating emaotions too much and complete disrespect on human feelings. But then came along teh better program such as M.Y.K. and Biggest Loser. Yes I am now into Biggest loser. Anyone who knows me would be shocked.
The two Tassie Cops kick arse and I will bet that they will be a real threat. Come on girls show what Taswegians are made of. For some reasons Australia thinks we are all inbred irresponsible sickos. I suppose that is why we have had a high consistency of contributing to sport and technology.

Question for Microchip users.... What is more important for you when purchasing our products, low or no shipping costs or faster delivery? Thank you!
Food Should Taste Good we're "nuts about" your chips and want to send the FSTG office some Yumnuts as part of our "Nuts About You" Valentine's Giveaway. Today you can send free Chocolate Yumnuts to the person that you are "nuts about" at http://nutsabout.yumnut.com - thanks for making such great products!
bought your Sweet Potato chips the other day for the first time and FELL IN LOVE! I believe they are my new favorite chip! I have since purchased 2 more bags! I keep making everyone who stops by my desk or at my house to try them! yummmmmmm!
We just discovered your Sweet Potato Tortilla Chips. All I could say was "Mmmm!" until my wife said, "Hey! Don't eat all of those."
I was at Children's Hospital in Seattle today and got very hungry but they didn't have very many Gluten Free options (or at least tasty ones). I did however find Sweet Potato Tortilla Chips and my world was then perfect!
first things first, i don't like sweet potato, second thing i never pass up something free. so i used my free food should taste good coupon on the only thing our store carried sweet potato tortilla chips. They were great. They will be in the grocery basket again. thanks again for the coupon, it convinced me.
I have a Pampered Chef party last weekend... and put out some of your chips... OMG they LOVED them - 9 new converts! They can't wait to get some!
Thank you so much for the samples you provided to our 'Gluten Free Social' hosted by Birmingham Celiac Disease Support Group, Gluten Free Cooking School, and Gluten Free Birmingham! The event was a huge success - and everyone LOVED the Food Should Taste Good chips! I really appreciate the great variety of flavors!
Came home to find a case of chips on my front porch. That was fast! Thanks so much. 
Used my free coupon on a bag of you lime torilla chips. MMM! I stopped eating them so I could buy salsa to enjoy with it...so hard to resist!
Thank you "Food Should Taste Good" for supporting our troops overseas. They were thrilled with the boxes of chips!
I'm trying to find a store in Fredericksburg Texas that sells your product so that I can redeem my coupon and try your chips. Help!!
Olive is my fav! That is what we will be serving! Yummy in my tummy! Judy :)
I just opened up the largest bag of Sweet Potato my local BJ's supplies...
Just tried the multigrain , and they were sooooo good! 
Excellent chips Multigrain & Sweet Potato are awesome!
I got a coupon for a free bag of chips. I got my bag and fell in love with the mulit grain. Thanks for the coupon.
Has anyone ever tried the chocolate flavor? I want to try it but I want to hear first if they are worth the order!!!
Chocolate flavor is divine! And I'm not a chocolate lover.
Wow, brought your sweet potato tortilla (or crackers) last night and I don't know how I lived so long without them! yumma yumma!
Thanks for offering a Gluten Free cracker chip that tastes good. Sweet Potato chips are my favorite.
Today, I used my coupon for a free bag of chips that I got on here when you gave them away. I got the sweet potato tortilla chips and tried them when I got home. And guess what?? We almost ate the whole bag because they were sooooo good!!! You guys should get together with Costco, so they can sell a big bag of them. Thanks for the coupon and yummy chips. I hope you have more coupons in the future.
Finally found your product in a store, so that I could use the free coupon you sent and .....wowo!! Awesome chips! :D Thank you!
Just finished off our very first bag of FSTG (free compliments of your coupon!), we tried sweet potato chips- all I can say is YUM!
your chips are THE BEST!!
LOVE your chips!!!!!
I really enjoyed your Lime Tortilla chip last night with homemade guacamole. Sooooo good, they're money!
Hey, I think I just saw a bag of your tasty chips on the coffee table at Charlie's house on Two and a Half Men!! Cool product Placement!!

I <3 your Sweet Potato Chips w/ Mango Salsa. Yummers!

Thanks again to everyone that entered the Touchdown Dance-Off!
Thank you for the free coupon--I used it last week when it was about -30 (yes really!), then drove home 2 1/2 hours away, only to find the checker had not deducted the coupon! And, it's hard to find stores around here that sell FOOD SHOULD TASTE GOOD! I must say that the chips WERE delicious, in spite of the fact that I had to pay for them. 
Okay, so I have the coupon for the chips ... where can I get them in Central kentucky?
I posted a video celebrating when do i get my case of chips In older post it said anyone who sends one get s a case of chips When will they been shipped out
Your chips rock!!
One of the things that made today a really good day here in Park City, UT: got the last bag of MultiGrain from the grocery store shelf. Feels like 3 out of every four trips they're already sold out. I mean, I get that they're that good. The grocery store needs to dump the other chips and dedicate an aisle to you guys. Just sayin'.
just finished a whole bag of your multigrain chips! Yum..me!
I buy my chips at Kroger - I love the multigrain and sweet potato ones - I noticed a package of LIME chips - might try them next time. Has anyone else had them? 
How can I get a Food Should Taste Good coupon from facebook so that I may use it to help donate 25 cents with my purchase to Share Our Strength?
We just got our case of Food Should Taste Good chips, Thank you very much We love your chips, they are so tasty 
Blown away by these chips. so simple, so good. awesome work Pete! Keep it up! we need more food guys like you :)
Just used my free coupon on the Jalapeno chips. Very good!! Thank you for the coupon! Def getting these again. I liked that your list of ingredients was pretty recognizable. :) 
Used my coupon for a free bag of the Sweet Potato chips. Found them at Kroger in the organic aisle. Very simple, yet very tasty! Will try more flavors!! Thanks!
oh YUM, I just bought my first two bags while looking for some Sun. afternoon "junk" food. Always looking for the healthy alternative...picked up a bag of the Jalapeno and the Sweet Potato. Ate the entire bag of Jalapeno and don't even feel guilty....only 12 pts. on WW. YUMMY!
What stores do you sell your chips in Tn? 
Just discovered this brand, thanks to a friend's suggestion. Am now fully addicted. Thank you!!!
The Works and hummus....... yummmm
I want to thank for making snacks that are gluten free. I just discovered your snacks, and I lvoe them. My favorite are the Sweet Potato Chips.
Dear FSTG, I have been buying your Sweet Poatato chips for a few months now but the last month the Sweet Poatato chips are completly diffrent, they taste and look dirrent. They are alot ligher in color and they dont have the taste they had when I first stared buying them. I noticed it the last few weeks. Did you make a changes in the reciepe in the last month? I like them better a month ago. 
We were so excited to see Howard, Leonard, and Raj with our Blue Corn and Multigrain chips on The Big Bang Theory! I wonder which one they liked more?
hey guys, i liked your video contest application. did you purchase it from someone or make it yourself? im interested in using it for my own personal webpage if you want to share/sell it. just message me on fb.
I have fallen in love with these chips and managed to get several friends addicted. The cheddar ones taste just like doritos! all the junk food flavor without the actual junk yum! I love the blue corn as well, great for dipping or just munching. Wish I could find the sweet potato ones here but apparently this area of NC is behind on the sweet potato craze lol, just started finding frozen sweet potato fries in the freezer section.
I have the Cheddar and Sweet Potato flavors that I love. I love the sweet potato chips with a ham sandwich. Anyway, I took them both to my Weight Watcher meeting today and we passed the bag around for everyone to sample. I know several people wrote it down and where to get it. More happy customers for you. : ))
Wanted to use my free coupon for my favorite--sweet potato but none at the store. Tried Olive and have a new favorite. WOW Thanks FOOD SHOULD TASTE GOOD!
Oh my goodness these so rock! I got them today at Fred Meyer in Sumner Wa. I got the tortilla chips that are made with blue corn and sea salt. Oh yea they are nom nom nom!
thankyou for the chips you sent me. we are enjoying them. The Works are awesome!
love your sweet potato chips!!
Yesterday I picked up a bag of the sweet potato chips and have only one word to say = delicious!
we LOVE the lime chips with our spicy wholly guacamole. great flavor AND good for you -- you rock FSTG!!!
just wanted to say LOVE the jalapeno chip!! great taste with just the right amount of heat!! The kids love the sweet potato chips!! Such a great alternative!! <3 your chips!! THX
Ok I keep puuting in for this and no chips for me I guess? So Far? lol.
LOVE the Olive chips!
I can not find your chips anywhere...Why?
Bought two bags of chips this morning and opened the Olive first. I just had to open the bag of Sweet Potato to try them too. I'm thinking the Olive is good for dipping and the Sweet Potato broken up with fresh salad greens and slices of grilled marinated chicken. 
Just bought my first bag of FSTG tortilla chips... they're wonderful!
Lately I've been so so addicted to the sweet potato!! just out of the bag :)
i can't find this brand anywhere i live in malta ny
I am loving my Sweet Potato chips...yummy! Thanks so much!

Just purchased my first bag of FSTG - Sweet Potato, and I am in love!! Thanks for making a great product!!
I would love to try the Chocolate!
I can't wait to try your chips!
Just saw Peter Krause's character pull out your chips on "Parenthood" on NBC!
Love the sweet potato!! Haven't tried the others yet.
The sweet potato ones finally came available in my local food lion! Omg so yummy, I've been waiting for them to be available here and bought a bag last night...can't stop munching them yum!
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this brand. The sweet potato chips are amazing! 
happy national tortilla chip day!!! yup, there is a holiday for everything. lol. get saavy about the chips you eat since not all chips are created equal. great quality CAN mean great flavor. we love food should taste good. pick them up and try them out (with wholly guacamole of course:).
Thank you for my free bag of Food Should Taste Good chips! I <3 them.
Entered the giveaway at Win, Lose or Blog. Love the Cheddar flavor.
I bought the cheddar chips for myself and my husband has now eaten 2 bags of them. I think I have had a total of 6 chips!! He is a junk food eater so I figured these would be safe from him! Luckily I have a bag at work for myself.

Enough with the spoilers! I am watching the Saturday repeat of the "Worst Cooks" semi final, and just before the reveal of the finalists, you run the commercial for the final, in which you clearly show who is in the final. You did it on Next Iron Chef too! 
Tried this yummy asparagus salad..very simple. Cook the asparagus al dente and then put in ice bath to stop cooking. Toss with Olive Oil or Seasme Oil (lightly) and throw on some salt and toasted seasme seeds. Very tasty.
If you are a Paula Deen Fan, You can pick up three of her spices at Big Lots. There is her seasoning salt, House Seasoning and Her Cinnamon Mix. All together they are $6.20 for all three. 
Wow, made the Beef and Onion Stuffed Potatoes from 5 Ingredient Fix...awesome!
Can someone please transcribe these instructions so that I may understand what I am doing: Wash and trim the chicken legs of any excess fat. Mix the garlic, rosemary, and panko together in a shallow rimmed dish and season well with salt and pepper. Alternately, crush the garlic and rosemary with some olive oil and salt in a mortar and pestle. This is from Tyler Florence's Crispy Baked Rosemary-Garlic Chicken Legs. Am I seasoning the garlic rosemary, and panko? I don't understand why I am crushing the garlic and rosemary after I am adding it to the panko either. Please help!
Chef Anne Burrell has officially won me over... I love her on Worst Cooks in America. I seriously DID NOT like watching her on her Secrets of a Restaurant Chef because while she loves what she does and loves her food and cooks amazing recipes, the "BIIIIIGGG" sounds she makes became SO annoying and the fact that she calls things "goo" and "critters" is completely unappetizing. I'm glad FN cares about not only showing us amazing recipes and entertaining us, but really gives us a glimpse into the "person" behind the TV chef. I would have been missing out on some serious talent and learning lessons as a cook myself. But I really wouldn't mind it if she laid of the "critter" and "goo" comments lol
Dear Food Network, My brother has learned a tremendous amount from the show Good Eats. He is making gourmet meals and breads. This is the kid that would only eat hot dogs, mac n cheese and spaghetti when he was little. I respectfully request that you show more episodes during the week. 
Just out of curiosity, has anyone ever made a Guy Fieri recipe? They all have a million steps and ingredients, and as I watch the show it occurs to me that he really doesn't teach the viewer at all-- it's just a big display of his cooking ability... isn't it supposed to be about US? (rhetorical question...)
I am looking for the recipe to the Jamacian Fried Chicken and Mango Chutney, it aired last night (2/19) on an Episode of Dinner's Drive ins and Dives, and it orginally aried on December 10, 2010. Can someone help me?
Just wanna throw this out here for discussion: on shows like 'Heavy', the morbidly obese are portrayed as psychologically unsound, weak, lazy, greedy, hopeless, etc, etc. Yet Ina Garten is now morbidly obese, yet NOBODY ever mentions her out of control weight. Seems to me that if you're rich and successful, you're 'allowed' to be morbidly obese and still respected by society, yet if you're living in a trailer, you're portrayed on TV as being somehow fundamentally unsound. Guess it's a case of 'The Mighty Dollar' showing yet again that there's one set of rules for the rich and successful, and another for the poor and struggling. Interested in hearing your thoughts on all this. :)
SERIOUSLY...food network people please make your cupcake wars contestants put their hair up. 
Lets go Blue Team Chef Robert Irvine Official Page! 
Hubby just said: "I think FN should go off the air after 9:00 p.m. " me: "why, dear?" Him: "cuz watching it at this time of night makes me HUNGRY!!" LOL
Yes Joshie......Chef Irvine...go back to the original hair color!!!!!
Son of a you know what. I had to come on the board and get spoiled!! Oh well. Congrats Joshie!! 
Good Job, Joshie. I was pulling for Georg....Joshie kinda made me nuts.
To which Iron Chef will you serve a Big Steaming Bowl of DEFEAT!? Love Iron Chef. Love to watch Morimoto. I know he's scary for people, but I wish he got chosen more. He's a true artist...
yumm quail...... 
Thank you food network, you are THE BEST!!! I loved participating in the tweetup, and those bowls that I won look fantastic! I will be baking something in them the second they arrive!!!
Just one more reason Chef Anne should be an Iron Chef.
Wow! am I thankful for this blog. My DVR stopped about 15 minutes before the end and I didn't know who had won. Thanks. :-) and I'm glad it was Anne.
I think it's funny that Robert called out Joshie for over-salting his food, because Anne always does that. I watched her make a brisket yesterday with at least a 1/4 cup of salt on it.
I WANTED GEORG TO WIN... SORRY BUT JOSHIE'S SWEATIN AND DOUBLE DIPPIN IN THE KITCHEN JUST GROSSED ME OUT. I WOULDN'T WANT TO EAT SOMETHING HE MADE BECAUSE THAT IS ALL I'LL BE THINKING.. SORRY BUT THATS JUST ME. GEORG SHOULD HAVE WON.. BUT OH WELL.... SHE IS STILL A WINNER IN MY BOOK :) 
i like cooking,.. any one teach or else give a recipes..pls pls... so your recipe can help me on my study of food tech. tnx alot..
Loved "Worst Cooks"! Way to go Joshie and Chef Anne. Georg did great, too. Chef Anne and Chef Robert were GREAT teachers!
Is there a show only for pastry making, not cakes. I would love to learn from the pros , for example pizza dough, pies etc. If there is a show i am not aware of it and i'd like to learn about it.
anyone have a good empanada recipe and could share?
i am looking for a great falafel recipe. anyone have one they would share?
my god that ice show looks like you took ace of cakes and scribbled out cake for ice
I want Ace of Cakes to remain on Food Network!!! Why did you cancel their show????
Angel food and Devil cakes for The Rite! Lol (Oscar night goodies)
Been craving Matzoh Ball Soup for dayyys
ON SUNDAY I Made fried baby back ribs, mix greens, bake sweet potatoe and apple, saute squash and onion, the best cheese mac and cheese and sweet butter milk cornbread. Desert we had bahe apple crumber. That was a great dinner. 
How about Jamaican/Italian Spaghetti?
NIGELLA. Thoughts? I've noticed she doesn't get too many mentions on this page. I think she's terribly affected, BUT, she is the only FN chef I actually watch FOR THE RECIPES, which I nearly always try (other FN shows I watch for 'entertainment'; their recipes are too complicated for lazy me, and seem very 'grill reliant', and I don't have a grill right now). Interested to hear what others think of Nigella. (I made her bacon-wrapped meatloaf with hard boiled eggs the other day, but my eggs sunk to the bottom of the meatloaf, so I don't know what I did wrong there....Sigh.)
Most of the shows on the food network are great and the food looks yummy. However, thats not how most of us eat. How about a show that follows a chef or chefs around and shows us some of the things that most of us eat and like. A guilty please sort of show. I would like to see them drinking a mocha frappe from mcdonalds and telling me why they like it. Like i do. Or a hamburger from feddies that tasts good on a much small budget than any one ive seen in newyork. So how about it. I you dont know what kind of food the rest of us like, call me. 
Where can I watch the Worst Cooks finale online? I am not finding the new season on your website (only last season) and it is the only episode I have missed watching on tv.
ok, fn, so many friends and family getting tired of re-runs, that damn cup cake crap and nasty chopped show!!! been watching since day one!! bring back the individual cooks. where's ming, aidia, mario, and my beloved emeril!! you didn't need that other new network. don't watch it much. hope y'all are listening!! better leave paula, rachael, ina, giada, ann b., guy, alone!!! :(
I really want to make Anne's bacon wrapped dates stuffed with manchego cheese, but manchego is out of my price range! Any worthy cheese substitutions, or will I just have to wait until I can afford to pay around $20 for a block of cheese?
I need to find some very simple dinner recipes. Does anyone have a quick link they could share with me?

I have two questions about "Restaurant Impossible." How did some of those places manage to avoid MAJOR health code violations? Has the publicity from the show helped or hurt business long term?
For my fiancee`s 26th birthday I made your Spaghetti-And-Meatball cake featured in the March issue of FN magazine. It was a HUGE hit! I used raspberry sauce in place of the strawberrys, and iced two 9-inch fudge marble cakes with milk chocolate frosting. He LOVED it!

I'm making pizza tonight! I love making pizza at home. SOOOOO much better than carry out. And if people knew how easy it really is, more would do it. :-)
I wrote this as my status, but my status's are locked--. Food Network, I think you should have Bobby Flay issue a throwdown to the Cake Boss, because apparently he thinks he can cook now. It would be -awesome-!

Duck Fat, I was watching Anne Burrell today on her show and she was doing a show with Duck Fat and I thought to myself, where the heck am I gonna get Duck fat here in the middle of Montana. This really is not a widely used indgredient Anne by most home cooks, what can we substitute. I bet its spendy. 
Hello, i am throwing a part and wanted to make Fresh Figs with Lemon-Scented Mascarpone & Honey, but fresh figs are out of season can you give me suggestions on which fresh fruit i can substitute the fresh figs with to go well with the Lemon-Scented Mascarpone & Honey. Thank You!

Don't miss the season premier of Ice Brigade Thursday, March 3rd at 10pm ET/9pm CT on the one and only Food Network! "Like" Ice Brigade for some sneak peeks! This team of renegade ice artists are armed with with chain saws, chisels and sledge hammers, and are ready to blow the lid off of ice sculpting by developing out-of-this-world, original designs that defy the imagination!
idea-their needs to be a show showing how to cook regular, everyday family meals. for example, most people still use boxed meals such as Hamburger Helper and such, quick pastas and canned vegetables. but the real trick is making these processed meals actually taste good. even though they are not as healthy as fresh ingredients, most of the populace still eat these. why not improve what they are already eating? but! you would need an everyday person showing instruction not a celebrity chef. 
Give me some ideas for dinner, I have pork, ground beef, or chicken to choose from. I cook dinner so much, I'm tired of the same old routine.
Once in a while, ya just gotta take a break from cooking. Tonight, I'm taking a break. Woo hoo!!
There's been a lot of talk on this forum about how healthy (or not) or fattening recipes on FN are. How about this for an idea? For EVERY recipe that's covered, why doesn't the fat count/calorie count appear on the screen at some point? Looks can be deceptive: I just watched Ina's breakfast segement: brioche, granola/yogurt and fruit/homemade jam and a Bellini. It looked quite 'healthy',but I just added up the calorie count (the calorie count for 'one' brioche, 'one' Bellini, 'one tsp of jam', 'small bowl granola', etc, etc), and it came to almost 900 calories (and it certainly didn't look it on the screen). Not to say that we couldn't have 900 calorie breakfasts, but it would be good to know so that we could then decide to eat lighter for the rest of the day.
We are very excited! We will have a table setup at the Crowns For a Cure Pageant tomorrow, Saturday, February 26th, at Plymouth South Middle School. Come see us, its a great cause (and only a $5.00 dollard donation)! We will have a raffle for something very, very yummy! We will also be selling some very yummy treats! 
how come Paula Deen is on @ 1230 instead of Giada? majot FAIL right there.
Do u have free gift cerificates to try the Apple -bees 550 calories menu items. i would like too, but unemployed money is very tight,just asking. Thank you

I was watching 30 Minutes Meals this morning and she made Salmon and Dill Chowder with Puff Pastry. I went to foodnetwork.com to find the recipe and it is absolutly NO where to be found. HELP!! It looks so good and want to make it for dinner tonight, where can I find it????
i like the food network, it shows you different foods to cook instead of cooking the samething for dinner, you learn alot. they show you differnt wines and deserts, wow its like watching rachel ray.
A Valentines Day message from Pat and Gina Neely:
Why does Chef Anne always put sooooo much salt on her food?
Does anybody have a good recipe for Roast/Chicken in the crock pot?
anyone know the names of the chef on this morning that made the Mexican meatloaf ???i want to make it tonight but i cant find it .i know it was pretty basic .but think i could come here and get the recipe i didn't really take notice and now i cant find it grrrr
What is that spice that is a mix of a bunch of different kinds of spices?
Does anyone know the name of this cooking trick..I call it Egg in a sauna-typical fried egg with a lid on it,a tiny amount of water to steam it to perfection-no turning.Sunnyside up only...I have never seen anyone (but me)use this and was wondering 
For those who have salt or sodium issues, can any of your people cook using substitutes? Love watching yet it is semi useless for some people...just a thought, thanks
Please bring back some VARIETY (aka Claire, Ales, Ina) to your Sunday morning programming!!! Rachel Ray = boring; Giada = can't stand her big toothy grin and OVERUSED Italian pronunciations!
I love watching the TV Chefs cook....but OMG, why do they use soooooo much salt???? They will say, "just a pinch of salt..." and then drop in a whole freakin' handful! I get nautious every time they ruin stuff like that. Do people really eat that much salt?????
what was the episode on this Friday or Saturday... that had three cooks making great cheap cuts of meat meals...? Cant find on the website for recipes
Turkey thighs, beef with red wine and shallots... and something else on that episode....
Oh my goodness I hate Restaurant Impossible. Hate seeing Irvine be rude to owners. Even if they are running things into the ground, they still have feelings.
Giada had my 3 boys (8, 6, & 4) mouths watering with her manicotti with sausage and peas this morning...I know what for dinner tomorrow!
After all the commercials, I had really hoped we were gong to have "new" Iron Chefs to watch for those of us that do not care one bit about the oscars - instead just reruns :(
..Please pass this on to Giada and her family...my Deepest Sympathy on the passing of her Grandfather...just seen him on the Oscar's....
Winter Squash Soup question: i love squash (acorn and butternut). i purchased a winter squash soup ready made in one of those square containers in the soup isle. it doesn't taste as good as i thought it would, bland, very boring. any suggestions on how to make a kick-butt squash soup with lots of natural squash flavor, or enhance this boxed soup? ~ the soup lover.
i just read they will be a haunted kitchen show ......... these ghost programs are going over board
After dealing with such nasty icy conditions and chilly temperatures today, Im thinking Im going to go out on a limb and make Chicken Tikka Masala tonight - that will surely warm us up!!!!
I made the blueberry nectarine crisp from the finale of worst cooks and let me say it was delicious, I got rave reviews!
Any ideas for dinner that includes spinach? I have a whole bunch of this healthy green.
a question to all, especially from the South: how do I make boiled peanuts, and how do I serve them?
Wanna know how to get to some of the places that Kid in the Candy store went to. Gottta get that Popcorn.
Here's a question for Food Network: what's the best way to clean pastry brushes? I find the task especially challenging after brushing with melted butter. Thanks!
Food Network was founded on April 19, 1993, as TV Food Network, and launched on November 23rd of that year; its legal name is still Television Food Network, G.P. Within a few years, the network had shortened its on-air brand name. It was created by Reese Schonfeld (one of the founders of CNN), under the direction of Trygve Myrhen, President of The Providence Journal. Its original partners included the Journal itself, Adelphia, Scripps Howard, Continental Cablevision, Cablevision Industries, and most importantly, Chicago's Tribune Company. Schonfeld, who was also a partner in the company, was appointed its Managing Director and sat on its management board along with two Providence Journal employees. The original lineup for the network included Emeril Lagasse (Essence of Emeril), Debbi Fields, Donna Hanover, David Rosengarten, Curtis Aikens, Dr. Louis Arrone, Jacques Ppin and Robin Leach. The next year the network acquired the rights to the Julia Childs library from WGBH.
In 1995, Schonfeld resigned as managing director of the network, but remained on its board until 1998, when he sold his interest in the company to Scripps. The Food Network had been acquired from the A. H. Belo Corp. Corporation by the E. W. Scripps Company in 1997, trading KENS-AM/TV in San Antonio, Texas, for it. Belo had acquired the network when it purchased The Providence Journal Company in 1996. Myrhen left the Journal company the following year.
Was watching Rachael Ray 30 min. meal, # 744orig. on 2/26/11, she did salmon & dill chowder with pastry crust and green bean & potato salad, when went in to get recipe, it had completely different items on it, same name for the show, but a chicken recipe??
What is this about Maine being the birth place of Whoopie pies. Everybody knows they came from Pennsylvania specially from Dutch country.
Finally got to see Dinners, dri....with Tortilla Cafe in DC on Capitol Hill and can I just say, she is so tame in this clip! I forget her name but she is almost scary happy! I LOVE HER! Almost as much as I love thier food there!
I am removing my self from food net work. I dislike the new management I am not in to sports. I like cooking shows and it is sad to see food net work going down hill. I dislike Ice Brigada, however I will miss all of you who like food net work and cooking.

I've been a fan for a long time. Anne Burrell is the best, and love Worst Cooks. Robert and Anne are great teachers and competitors. I enjoy finding new receipes, techniques and great foods to share with friends and family. Keep giving me your entertainig chefs and shows. Thanks so much.
I recently (roughly a month or so ago) saw an episode of The Best Thing I Ever Ate, and there was a part about some kind of mashed potato from Ireland. I have been searching for this episode/recipe since the airing and cannot find it for the life of me. Does anyone know which I'm talking about and have a link for it? Thanks!
I feel as though every single time I turn on the Food Network, Rachel Ray is on. Can you please show a larger variety of cooks?
Thank you for all your culinary inspiration! My first cookbook came out today and just made #11 on the hot new releases! http://www.amazon.com/gp/new-releases/books/6/ref=pd_nr_b_nav
This Thursday is the start of the Year of the Rabbit, a very lucky year. Can you post some recipes for Chinese New Year?
Okay I didnt like the chilaquile post. So this is what I use ....I cut the corn tortilla's in chip shapes and deep fry them..... then i grate alot of longhorn cheese and monterey jack cheese. I also chop up some black olives. I make my own family recipe red sauce.... then i cook some hamburger meat. In a casserole dish i layer the chips and sprinkle the cheese and olives and hamburger meat. Then pour the sauce all over the first layer. then I add another layer of chips and cheese and olives, meat and sauce again. repeat until your done with all the ingredients. make sure you sprinkle cheese and olives on top before putting in oven. Keep in oven for 35 minutes on 325 degrees... serve with some sour cream and home-made Salsa and enjoy
Did anyone get the recipe for cinnamon buns on the Paula Dean show? If you have it, please share with me...they sounded like perfection!!! Thanks 
I sort of enjoy watching Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives on Food Network........ BUT someone should tell Guy Fieri while he's in the kitchens to keep his filthy meathooks OFF the food that they're cooking in those restaurants. Am I the only one that thinks it's repugnant? RR
I'm looking for a stellar guacamole recipe...any suggestions? 
Home made pizza with all the fixin's, my own B-B-Q garlic recipe for mouth watering wings and a fab 't get enough cheese spread that is gone before you blink :) For those of you that are looking for recipes that ROCK and are FULL of flavor my favorite chefs/cooks are Bobby flay, paula Dean and Guy ........ they always steer me in the direction of great food! 
I noticed today how much my 15-year-old son looks like Ann Burrell since he bleached his hair for swim team. Check out my profile pic and see if you agree :) 
Dear Food Network: I would like to be a judge on Cupcake Wars. My qualifications include: enjoying eating cupcakes and highly evolved tastebuds. References available upon request.
Ok - that one contestant on Chopped is just a little bit obnoxious
Curling up for a major snow storm here and thought a good hearty Turkey Vegetable soup would be good to make.... Just something comfy about soup - especially homemade right down to the fresh made stock!
covered in CHOCOLATE weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wanted to relax and watch some Food Network before bed, but you've got an ucky line up tonight... Private Chefs of BH and Cupcake Wars are the worst shows you've got.
Chicken Wings are a Superbowl favorite so why not try Sweet & Spicy Chicken Wings from the Hispanic Food Network? Grab the recipe at www.hispanicfoodnetwork.com & click on the Daily Dish tab. Your friends will love them!

Iced in at home in Dallas for 2 days. Thanks to my husband who went to the store ahead of time, we've been eating good! Having grilled chicken, home made Mac & cheese and chocolate chip bread pudding for dinner. Enjoying this little 'ice-cation'.
I was wondering...WHEN is there going to be a GLUTEN FREE cooking show?!?!!? More & More people are being diagnosted EVERYDAY!!!!!!! If you agree..please share...;^D
what is the best way to cook ribs with out a smoker. I have a gas grill. I usually do a rub and wrap in foil and cook slow in the grill. Then when ready put ribs on directly on the grill and cook with BBQ sauce for a few mins. Any good tips?
Dinner Impossible tonight, Robert should have walked out the door. Those people were more than pigs. They should have been closed and he should have left. They had dirty rotten food, dead rats and rat shit everywhere. Good lord. They will return to being pigs. Shame on them. I just think Robert did too much for them. 
Dear Food Network, I love Chocolate weekend but cannot get through a minute of the Neelys and their regular show. I really doubt that I will be able to watch a whole day hosted by them. Dodging the occasional commercial is hard enough. (See, I had to stop typing to switch off of them.) Chocolates are sweet; you could have chosen hosts that don't tend to be cloying.
Oh grt Dave is baking 2day i myt learn a thng or 2. Apple cake mmmmh
For Super Bowl Sunday, try tackling hot wings -- Alton-style: http://ow.ly/3PGrj.
LLOKING FOR A QUICK AND EASY RECIPE FOR SOME SPINACH DIP FOR SUNDAY...HELP...
Down Home with the Neeleys were just on TV at 10 am Central time an I went to foodnetwork to see the recipes and I cannot find them on there. I did not get to see what type soup was that they made and wanted to look up the recipes. Why are they not on? Linda Moore lindatibbals@yahoo.com

I just can't stand watching "The Neelys" on Food Network. They are too suggestive for my taste and I certainly can't have them on when the kids are in the room.....didn't turn it today as I was in the middle of doing other things.....did anyone else see her hit Pat in the head with the whisk and then use it to mix the frosting? I had to turn the TV. 
I had "liked" the Cupcake Wars page and posted a question. When I checked back to see if they answered, it appeared that I had been deleted and blocked. I am not sure if it was the right page. Anyway, I was trying to get a list of all cupcake shops that have won on that show. I am traveling to California and want to go to a few of them. Any help would be great! Thanks so much
The number of people leaning toward a plant-based diet is rising all the time. What about a fun, informative, and creative show to highlight this new way of eating - an amazing cooking show featuring a different renowned vegan chef in each episode! The show would be innovative and cutting edge, keeping in trend with the food/health revolution that is taking place in our nation. Vegan most certainly does NOT mean boring! Some ideas: Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, Tal Ronnen - Conscious Cook, Dave Anderson of Madeleine Bistro, Ann Gentry of Real Food Daily, Eric Tucker of Millenium, Tanya Petrovna of Native Foods, Jenny and Heather Goldberg of SporkFoods, Rod Rotundi of Leaf Organics, Robin Roberston, Donna Klein, Isa Chandra Moskowitz, Terri Hope Romero, Mark Reinfeld of Vegan Fusion Cuisine, Dreena Burton... and that's just getting started!
My local grocery store just hooked me up with 5#'s of heirloom tomatoes - its time to make some homemade peasant tomato soup and my homemade marinara - got a homemade ravioli dish coming up soon!!!
I am hooked on hot wings. Not so much the wings themselves but the hot sauce. Recently, our favorite place closed that made the hot sauce and blue cheese from scratch. It was to die for. Any suggestions? Im not talking franks hot sauce and butter here. Thanks so much. Lisa
Paula and Michael Symon were adorable in that episode with the coconut bread pudding!!!
love cupcake wars... vanilla bean chefs in Fort Wayne Indiana, love to be on Cupcake Wars...
What is going on with the SERIES FINALE of Acr of Cakes?!?! What is happening?????
Every time I click on the recipe to either copy it or save it, I get a message "Operation Aborted" and I am shut down. Does anyone have any ideas about what may be going on and how to fix it? I watch Food Network on TV, but can't get any of the recipes. I can't write fast enough to write while I watch and my memory is not good enough to not have it in writing. Appreciate any suggestions.
I have been looking for a recipe by Paula Dean for a long time and I cant find it anywhere. While I was watching one of her shows, she made a type of smoothie with hot chocolate mix and ice cubes made of coffee and some other ingredients. It looked and sounded so good but i dont remember the name of it! Does anyone know what it is? Thanks
Just watched Big Daddy's House with his daughter. CAN SHE PLEASE BE ON EVERY EPISODE!?!?!??! I heart her!
Can I just say, I'm still looking for the 'Dark Chocolate as a Snack' recipe by Ellie Krieger. I hear it was an excellent recipe, and I'm heartbroken that I can no longer find it on the site. Could someone pass it on? Thanks.
I saw an episode of Giada at home and she made these carmelized onion and apple crostini. I can't find the recipe online does anyone have it?
Just for starters :)
Turned on Secrets of a Restaurant Chef on just in time to see Anne double dip TWICE into whatever she was making. No wonder people have sanitation issues on Worst Cooks in America- they watch her. And if she didn't taste her dishes 3 time she'd probably be thinner.
Loving the Covered in Chocolate Theme shows this weekend!
There's not much on the cooking shows that I don't love. I do love Ann Burrell's enthusiasm! Even when I saw her only as a sous chef. I was watching the show "Secrets Of A Restaurant Chef" closely while she was making her asparagus salad-and she double dipped with her fork twice! She gets on the people on "Worst Cook In America" for doing the same thinf.
Why is Ace of Cakes going off the air? I am very upset about this. :(
Ok, inquiring minds want to know -- who pulled the plug on Ace of Cakes? Duff or FN?
I am not feeling this new Saturday line up. I want Sunny and the Neely's back on Sat. mornings. 
Nothing like a good old fashion beef patty to start eating
OMG..food network challenge got it SOOO wrong tonight.... how in the world did a broken piece win tonight... Sigh
Does anyone know which episode of Boy Meets Grill, Bobby made a white cheese dip or a queso dip on the grill? I used to have the page saved on my favorite's list but my computer crashed. I would really appreciate if someone could help me find it!!

Why ???? I was watching Rachel Ray this morning. Why is that irritating music playing throughout the show. It's very hard to listen to her with that music playing. I had to turn the show off. Such a shame.
I have enjoyed Food Network all weekend! I have laughed out loud with those Gina & Pat "chocolate" bits of love & fun! They are adorable!
Why is Ace of Cakes leaving???? I will miss Duff and the whole staff. It's one of my favorite shows.
No more tears Sandra Lee -- I know you hate cutting onions. I keep mine in the refrigerator. When I cut them I never have tears and they still have all their flavor. Hope this helps!! 
Where can I find the meatloaf recipe that Ina Garten and guest chef ? made on the show that aired on 2/5/11?
OK, who's brilliant idea was it to cancel Ace of Cakes???? Are you nuts?
OK, I went on the Food Network website to get Ina's recipe for ice box cake and Paula's recipe for chocolate cream puffs which were shown on 2/5. It said these recipes are not available. Are you kidding? The shows were just on yesterday. Cmon!!!!
Food Network has gone crazy-- they are canceling Ace of Cakes. BOO Hiss! really people, we love Duff but we love all the friends at the bakery, too.
Homemade from scratch..baked beans to serve 50 hungries. ..Go Packers!
Beer and Bacon Chili, Crab dip and potato skins... Chocolate and peanut butter brownies
i am making hot mexican cornbread, with jalopena peppers, mexican velveeta cheese, mexican corn, seasoned ground beef and topped with southern cornbread. 
Were having wings, pizza, taco dip, crab dip, ale/cheddar dip, brats boiled in beer/butter and then grilled. I've been cooking since 10 am. Everyone have a great time!
I have my game jersey on and my game face on.lolToday my husband and I are having a pancake throw down(per request of our 3 boys). I will be making bannana nut pancakes topped with fresh bannanas,pecans ,and whiped cream (going bannanas for the packers). My husband will be making cinnamon pancakes with reese's chip topped with more reese's chips and whiped cream(tryin to steel a win for the steelers).
Anyone ever tried Guy's Garlic Ginger Pork and Sizzling Rice recipe? I made it yesterday but changed the amount of diced ginger and garlic - it called for 3/4 CUP of each...wondering what the real proportion should be. Your mouth would be on fire for days with that much garlic and ginger.
Not game day related but I'm wondering if unopened canned goods can go bad in the refidgerator?
I just wanna say...everyone has some great photos of what they r having.....HAPPY SUPERBOWL
Okay... I know "Worst Cooks in America" is an elimination contest but it still stinks that people go home. They're all nice. Some dippier than others on any given week but all likable. There is no boasting about how great they are... they are just trying to cook.
I hate Cupcake Wars! Take it off the air...
Watching worst cooks...enough w/the sausage jokes...c'mon...
Valentine's Day is just around the corner so why not celebrate with Mexican Chocolate Pound cake from the Hispanic Food Network? Grab the recipe at www.hfntv.com & click on the Daily Dish tab. Thanks!
While I like the idea of 'Worst Cooks", the show is rapidly becomely less about building up the real cooking skills of the contestants so they can represent the two chefs in the final challenge and more about hazing type challenges. Come on - when is the next time these folks are going to need to stuff a sausage or filet a sea bass?
Does anyone have a list of all the Cupcake Wars winners? I am trying to find all the shops in Los Angeles in Boston and can't seem to find this info anywhere....Thank you
Does anyone have the recipe for the dish Chef Robert cooked with the sausage? Thanks
Please share any of your kitchen stories about items that you were dying to get but didn't help you at all or were a hazard.... I want to hear your stories on gadgets and appliances in your kitchen as I do research for an article Im writing here in Chicago!
i just met, took a pic with, & got Food Network Star ROBERT IRVINE'S autograph!!! He is even more good looking in person LOL, super friendly, and love his british accent hahaha....think this just about made my life hahaha, even tho i can't cook worth a damn I the food network, ironically i watch it whn im hungry & it fills me up, weird i know, ud think itd have the opposite effect!!!
I would like to know if anyone has been able to duplicate the shrimp scampi recipe from Red Lobster? That is the only place that I have found to get it prepared like that.
Dear Food network I want to ask you to stop airing the down home with the neeleys. I cant take that show at all if its on I turn it,. They need to tone the hug and kiss thing I want to see food not that mushy love stuff save that for the privacy of their home. Sorry I tried to watch this show I cant take it anymore.
WHY?? Are you taking Ace of Cakes off? If Duff is getting a new show what is it and will his staff be a part of it??
Just saw the ad for Chopped: All Stars! I can't wait!
how did that squid wind up with a whole sardine inside? They don't eat like that. they shred their food with a tiny little beak.
Just saw the preview for Chopped All Stars!! Gonna be great... Finally good to see the judges in the contestants' shoes. Maybe they can be less critical with their judging (bones in my fish, etc) and start judging the contestants based on their intention with the secret ingredients with the limited amount of time given.
I just love me some Paula she is the Bomb Ya'll
Got to meet Bob Irvine at The Mohegan Sun Wine Fest. It was a blast.
i like watching your cooking shows, you learn something everyday, helpful. like you should never eat the green part of rubarb,i like too cook, heres a tip to making a hambugar, in a skillet put a 1/2inch of water in, then make your bugers, then score,cook with lid on until you here fring, remove lid turn over until brown,remove.
Recipe of the Day: Giada's Chocolate Souffle (http://ow.ly/3SBBK)
Anybody have a really good peanut butter cookie recipe? I want a soft chewy cookie not hard. Thanks! Send me a message :)
Need a good laugh? Watch the Worst Cooks audition video: http://ow.ly/3SCfH. The young boys comment on his moms cooking is priceless!
Please put Big Daddy's House back in its original time slot. 
Gonna miss Duff and the crew from Charm City Cakes! I can't believe this weeks episode is the SERIES FINALE.
I love quite a few of your shows, but my favorite is Aarti Sequeira (Official Fan Page!)'s Aarti Party, and I am just wondering, why are her seasons so short?
Had a man ever won cupcake wars?? :( Can't beleive he didnt win tonight!?!
I really enjoy watching Cupcake Wars but wish you would replace judge Florian Bellanger. I am sure he is outstanding but I honestly can not understand a word he says and it appears he is extremely hard on everyone. 
this thursday is the last airing of ACE of CAKES - hope to see Duff & Co. in something else soon - my daughter was really sad when she heard this. 
Last night on Cupcake Wars, the male contestant said something like...."I added pinot noir to the red velvet batter." My seven-year-old heard, "I added pee on the wall to the red velvet batter." OMG! 
I luv your channel, but whats with all the butter and salt. I think its time your cooks start thinking about making the meals a little more healthier.
I've been making lot's of mexican dishes lately, any ideas other than mexican for chicken breast?
I love cooking & Love whaching FataFeat channel I Will Own the best restaurant in the world and also the cooking channel if god willing
Dear Food Network, I am a big fan, I would like more recipes with chicken and less recipes of almonds and mushrooms, cause I am allergic. I enjoy cooking and I learned so much from the expert. I am Ecuadorian, a fan of Jose Garces and cause I am a girl I like Anne Burrell cooking style. Thanks all.
Does anyone have any suggestions to keeping chips, Chocolate, butterscotch, Peanut butter ect... from sinking to the bottom of a cake. Especially Bunt Cakes ????
SHOW IDEA!! I would like to see a show that features a couple like my husband and I, we are always cooking with each other but it doesn't happen like the Neely's (they are really corny!) I would like to see a couple that has fun and are normal everyday cooks, someone people can relate too! WE would like to try out for a show for the normal couples out there!!
I just watched Guy. His whole menu looked so good!! 
lol. my phone sometimes cuts off status updates part way through so all i saw for food networks update was... recipe of the day : lemon-butt ( it didn't sound very appetizing)
Aphrodisiacs: Are amorous eats like oysters and chocolate really love potions? Find out: http://ow.ly/3Tsou.
Food Network: Please don't make the same mistake that A&E did and turn all your shows into reality dramas. Television could do with less of that. Stick with the Ina's, Jamie's, Guy's, and Nigella's and you'll have a winning channel.
I'll miss you, Ace Of Cakes. You were a great show.
Made the pesto cream sauce from this months magazine. It was awesome! I served it w/penne and fresh grated parmesan. 
All those in my area of Brentwood CA, 94513, please come out on May 27th thru May 29th for our first annual sanctioned BBQ Cook off. We have paired up with the Kansas City BBQ Society and will be hosting our first annual cookoff, it is going to be a 3 day smokey meat filled weekend. Love to see all those in our area come out and join us. No admission fee, just pay for what you eat from the cooks. It is sponsored by the Brentwood PAL, Police Activities League. Hope to see you there!
I loved Chopped before, but now i think i love it even more, cant wait for Chopped All-Stars! How does it feel to be on the other side of the chopping block?
So sorry to see that Ace Of Cakes is going off the air. It is such a good show. I love it and will miss it like crazy. Hope they come back with something else. I will miss all the fun and beautiful cakes they make. Keep making those beautiful cakes and stay in business. You are all the best. 
Why is "Ace of Cakes" going off the air?, Your "Cupcake Wars" is no AOC and you guys know it. Don't you know that everyone who loves food network loves Duff and the gang at Charm City and what a hit your ratings will take on thursday nights once they are gone. I am so disappointed I have watched AOC since it began and even own 3 seasons on dvd because Duff and the gang have inspired me that much and I'm sure that there are other people out there that feel the same way I do....
Just saw the commercial for Chopped All Stars - SO PUMPED!
I am so excited about Chopped All-stars. I was just thinking the other day, I'd like to see the judges do this!
OH NO..Top Chef...NOT Fabio, it should have been DALE....
I just have to say I am really dissappointed you are not airing Good Eats all week like you say on your website. I love Alton Brown! He teaches me how to actually cook achievable things. He teaches the science behind it and why some things work and others don't. I WANT MORE GOOD EATS NOW!
Just watched a preview to a new NBC show called "America's Next Best Restaurant" with Bobby Flay. Need more info. When does it start?
Who won the mini cupcake throwdown? 
Ah, chicken pot pie. Delicious! See our chefs make their best variations of this creamy, crispy-topped favorite: http://ow.ly/3TV2g.

Recipe of the Day: Chocolate Truffles (http://ow.ly/3U2kz)
What kind of chocolate will be guaranteed to harden when making chocolate covered strawberries?
I was watching Barefoot Contessa today, a guess came on to help cook, never washed his hands but started chopping Veggies, whaat do you think?
food network programs are getting old :))))) people want variety ... you guys hired way too many mediocre chefs and wasted all your showing times with them .. what happened to legends like batali, contessa, flay, emeril etc ? all your veteran chefs are brushed off to the side .. and what's up with your content too ... is this a gameshow network or a cooking network ? i'm a bit confused because it seems to be somewhere in between :))), i'm 18 years old and i can cook better than half the dummies you guys hire, not to mention i know how to talk to a CROWD, half of them don't even know how to talk .. they're turning their backs to the camera and they make huuge slipups that you see are edited out in the next scene .. people have eyes, they're not stupid :)))))) i know it's not easy to be good at television / showbiz type stuff but if they take it upon themselves to present their work to the camera, they better be prepared or face harsh criticism ... rethink
Is it just me or is Anne Burrell's show, Secrets of a Restaurant Chef one of the most annoying shows ever???
I'm making Chef Robert's Pan Seared Chicken w/ Potato-Vegetable Hash. The kitchen smells amazing! Almost dinner time!
Knife Skills: Do you have them? Know the proper way to slice an onion, dice a zucchini or julienne a pepper? We thought we knew until we watched this: http://ow.ly/3UgAC.
Today I was watching Giadas show, it really bathered me that she threw to the garbage half a red pepper in perfect good condition, she also discarded almost half a romaine lettuce because those leaves were the outer leaves, and another lettuce I do not remember the name for the same reason. I think that there are other uses for those "unwanted" pieces and would be nice to hear them take this in consideration.
Camping this summer for 14 days transitioning between campgrounds every 4-5 days-any great tasting camping meals-thinking beef, chicken, and fish meals. We arent a typical camping hot dog and hamburger family! Feeding 2 teens and 2 adults.
I have a question - what happens to the 1000's of cupcakes from the loser in Cupcake Wars. Seems like a wate of materials and food if just thrown out! Can someone answer that question for me. Thanks
Ace of Cakes is going off the air? Wow! Super great show!
Why no more Ace of Cakes:( I am sad 
I'm not an Ace of Cakes fan, but seeing how it was one of the most popular shows on the network for a long time, I think it's pretty awful of you to only give them a 1/2 hour series finale that would have been a regular show if it hadn't been canceled. You kind of kicked them while they were down.
I was sad watching Ace of Cakes tonight, I REALLY hope they will be back in time, its so neat to see how far they have come-this show needed to ba a special hr. long one!! Come back Duff & crew ASAP!! :)
Just saw the Chopped All stars commercial... looks like they took our advice.. CANT WAIT!
I CANNOT WAIT FOR CHOPPED ALL STARS!!! hehe I feel like a nerdy loser for being so giddy over a tv show :P 
Oh yeah ha! chopped all star is coming up & chef Robert Irvine is going 2 be there. When is that show going 2 start? Personnaly would love 2 see more shows of Chef Robert Irvine. Love love his recipies. Plus his one hot chef =)
 When you think of baking for that special someone think Hispanic Food Network. Mexican Chocolate Pound Cake, Tres Leche Cake or frosted Mexican Chocolate Cake are sure to please. Find these recipes at www.hfntv.com & click on the Daily Dish tab. Have a sweet weekend!
It seems I have fallen in a rut for cooking ideas.... ground beef, chicken, pork or seafood recipes that don't include onions or peppers please????
Im making Mahi Mahi tonight and have no idea what to make with it. Does anyone have any ideas?...Im encrusting it with pecans and baking it. ...

Why is Ace of Cakes leaving???
Does anyone know if last night's Ace of Cakes will be rerun? I forgot to DVR it. Argh!!!
What can I make with beef stew meat other than basic beef stew?
I'm looking for the shrimp corndog recipe....Neely's, I think??? The French Onion Soup I made, was AWESOME!!!!
Love the new Italian issue! Pasta! Pasta! Pasta!!!! Making homemade penne vodka for our Valentine's dinner! Awesome tips and yummy recipes in this issue!!!!!!
Hi, can anyone recommend a Cream Cheese Frosting Recipe to me please :)
I love this channel. One day I want to be on it!!! Check out some of my cakes on my page! Please let me know what you think!!!
Just made some oven baked caramel cinnamon french toast that I had soaking in the frig all night....DELISH!
It's really frustrating to me how the chefs just throw away the piece of bell pepper they don't use or the egg yolks when they just use the whites, etc. I say you either require them to make a compost bin like Guy Fieri or have the chefs save whatever is left.
It's comfort food night tonight! My four-cheese ravioli with a Spinach-Garlic Mornay Sauce, garnished with finely diced sun-dried tomato, and fresh grilled chicken. Cant wait!
I JUST MADE PAULA DEENS PEACHES AND CREAM MUFFINS EXCEPT I USED FRUIT COCKTAIL BECAUSE I DIDNT HAVE PEACHES. THEY ARE AWESOME!!
On Unwrapped this past week, there was a segment on a company that made white chocolate treats with crunched up pretzels in it. Does anyone know the name of the company or how to find it's name??? HTLII
The Boyfriend made the Pork Meatballs in Spicy meat sauce from the latest issue of Food Network Magazine. We had it with polenta. Oh my God! Wonderful!!!!
Hey guys!! Just wanna say you're amazing! The web is so wide :) I just discovered the Ellie's thing ans I loved it! I live in Chile so I can not watch any video :( I 'd like to suggest a weekly meal planner ;) xoxoMarcela
Yesterday I watched Barefoot's "Jeffery Dinner". I have been making stuffed cabbage for years using my Mothers recipe with twists of my own. She always used Minute Rice. One time I tried to use uncooked regular rice like Ina does, and it stayed hard as a rock and ruined dinner. How does she get it to cook?
I was watching the Neely's episode to day and they were making grilled cheese sand wishes, we have tvo so were able to pause and rewind. Patrick burnt the Grilled Cheese bad. Ha Ha funny..
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this channel especially Guy Fieri's Diners, DriveIns & Dives. Can't wait to travel so I can lookup some of these places in the state of which I'll be visiting. I have the book also so that I can look it by the state. Sunny Anderson, BigDaddy McCargo, Neelys, Paula etc. I WUV ALL U GUYS!!!!!!
Does anyone know the calorie/fat counts for Ma Mae's Buttermilk Biscuits by Alton Brown?
Oh my word!! Guy Fieri is a hoot!!! Watching Diners, Drive Ins and Dives today ...he was filming the segment for "Pit Stop" restaurant and the chef Tony Rubono was oiling down and searing a whole pork shoulder for a cuban sandwich on the griddle. Guy pushes it from side to side with a spatula, sliding it up and down, saying Pork a Puk! Hilarious!!!
Making Paula's Fried Chicken tonight. Already have the chicken in a buttermilk bath. Can't wait! 
I'm so sorry to tell you this but your host on Outrageous Food has a voice that is not becoming to t.v. You need to steal Adam Richmond. He is AWESOME.
Just purchased Paula Deen's cast iron 5 qt casserole dish and was wondering if anyone could tell me how to clean it if you can't use detergent.
I made Ina Garten's Roast Pork with Fennel and it was just delicious! A perfect dinner party dish!

Joshie??? Really??? Carlos has won EVERY week for the red team. Silly decision to let him go now. 
I just saw a commercial for 'Chopped All Stars" was I dreamin' or is it for real? If it's for real, IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!! Thanks btw. ;)
Anyone have a "Health Master" high power appliance blender? Montel is promoting it on the Living Well show and selling for $200+ shipping/handling. It crushes all the vegetables and makes a juice. And they say people loose weight and improve stamina. Appreciate your comments.

He said, "It don't need a damn thing"!!!!!!!! Love me some Neely's!!!
Is it just me or when Georges wife came out did you expect to hear your mom is here!
i was watching Pat and Gina this morning, and i was all into that spinach and artichoke dip, which is my favorite appetizer also, but Pat you had me cracking up w/that comment: it don't need a damn thing, lmao
Bobby Flay is my favorite chef...I wish I could cook with him one day! His Lobster Avocado Salad looks amazing! He had me at "Avocado" LOL ;o)
happy valentine day to all
I would love to make Pesto but I cannot put nuts in it, what is a substitute? Do you even need the nuts to make pesto?
What can i cook with hamburger meatttttt
loves the show Worst Cooks in America. My two favs won from each team. I wonder who will win next Sunday. Go Georg and Joshi!!!!!!!
A fresh garden salad smothered in fresh sauteed Margarita-marinated shrimp with a sprinkle of kosher salt.... OHHHHHH this hit the SPOT!
Is there anyway we can find out the caloric and nutritional values of the dishes on your site? So many of them sound great, but since we're on a diet here in this house it makes it hard to cook anything without knowing if it's really healthy for us.
Have a "Knife, Fork... Pork!" Valentine's day everybody.
Looking forward to Chopped All-Stars! My wife was thinking it would be great to have the Iron Chefs compete on Chopped, but this is going to be just as fun!
Can substitute shrimp for scallops? I can find them where I live.
Check out the Feast of Men page and a restaurant steak critiquing group!
watching best thing i ever ate......GINO'S EAST!!!!!! HELLLL YA!!!! <3
Michael Psilakis is the sexiest man alive. LOL. just sayin. 
Was motivated by the extreme artic winds coming home last night - I managed to bake up two cinnamon-swirl bread loaves. My home smells so cozy warm!
Why in the name of God, have you banished the award winning program "Good Eats" to a late night spot just once a week. Are you trying to run the Food Network into the ground? Dump some of these stupid competition shows, they have outlived their usefulness.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be mean. But following up a Challenge where someone created an incredible, realistic-looking poodle out of cake, icing and cotton candy with a show that tries to make cupcakes look intense is just, well, silly. Try as they might, judging cupcakes like they're awesome works of art just makes them seem pretentious and ridiculous. I'm sure they're tasty. But they're no giant poodle cakes.
Cupcake wars... cheering for the team who pulled back their hair. I want to puke thinking of all of the hair in those cupcakes.
Just saw the commercial for Chopped AllStars!!! WE ARE SO EXCITED!!! We will be tuning in!!
Just made the Light Alfredo Sauce recipe from this month's FN magazine and love it! Great calorie and fat count. The ban on alfredo sauce has been lifted at the Cochran house. Thank you Food Network.
why cant i use "sea salt" to brine?
hi can u facebook recipes for ground turkey i need some other than chili or soup or burgers can u help???
I think the Neeley's have to many sexual undertones on their show....just my opinion
I AM A LONG TIME FOODNETWORK WATCHER.........I REALLY THINK THERE IS TOO MUCH RACHEL RAY..........DOES SHE OWN THE STATION???? MISS SEEING TYLER FLORENCE...........WOULD LIKE TO SEE A COOK THAT COOKS LIKE FROM SCRATCH TO TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO COOK WITH OUT BOX BROTHS.... WINES.......20 SEASONINGS PER ITEM, AND TEACH PEOPLE TO COOK WITH SOME OF THE BASIC ITEMS IN A KITCHEN ALL THE SEASONINGS AND WINES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. OLD FASHION COOKING WOULD BE REALLY REFREHSING WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE "2 HOT TAMALES" FROM THE OLD DAYS.....

I was so upset with Top Chef tonight!! Whats up with that Bravo????? Ducking from Jennifer! hehehe 
Never made Lasagna without cooking the noodles first. Robin Miller did that on this mornings show and I am wondering if any of you have done this and do the noodles come out sticky or startchy tasting. 
has anyone there come up with a high protien low cal/fat recipe? would be VERY interested in it if so. thanks!
How come my comments on COMFORT FOODS come up 'delete' instead of 'message'.. just askin'...
Check out these amazing cupcakes my daughter made!
ok Foodies. i received some fennel and have no idea what to do with it. HELP!!!! any good recipes that you can share would be great. thanks all!
my grandpa made these amazing plum dumplings...plums wrapped in dough then rolled in cinnamon & sugar topped with butter. Unfortunately none of us have the recipe. I was wondering if you have a recipe for this or something close to it? I really want to make these and have something to remind me of my grandpa and his awesome cooking! Can you help?
Flying solo tonight so a little bulk cooking was in order! Chicken Vegetable Stew with Garlic Biscuits - just waitin' to get dunked! LOL
Just saw Anne Burrell wrap halibut with mandolin-sliced potatoes and fry it. Does anyone know if that works with mandolin-sliced zucchini as well?
Tried to copy Sunny Anderson's idea for stuffed peppers then came up with my own idea....instead of beef/rice and tomato, I'm going mexican. Beef fajitas with guac, and cheese stuffed peppers with verdi sauce over rice.
I love the Barefoot Contessa but I feel like I have seen all her episodes, any other fans feel that way?
I have become really disappointed with the show "Chopped." Scott Conant NEVER gives a lady chef a chance. He has her on the chopping block before she ever starts cooking. . Scott Conant also judges the chefs on his personal tastes...if he doesn't like an ingredient he will chop your dish. Alexandra Guarnaschelli is a total disappointment as a chef and a judge. Since she is so often on "Chopped" recently...I do not watch it at those times. Quite often the winner is the one who makes the most mistakes...often serving food that the judges say is dry or overcooked. Once upon a time "Chopped" was one if not my favorite Food Network show...I will not be watching it as much in the future.
Cheers its National Drink Wine Day! What type of wine do you enjoy with your home-cooked meals?
Food Network Cheers its National Drink Wine Day!
I need some help finding some sweet or fruity wines. Any suggestions??
Does the Food Network have any diabetic recepies on their website.
I am interested in learning some new tequila food and cocktail recipes what would you suggest?
Can someone please tell me why, the chefs on this net work take meat from brown paper and start cooking it with out a wipe down?
I would love to see the Network show some old Justin Wilson shows even if it is on the new cooking show. Thanks Mark
It's true friend's, today is national 'drink wine day'! And also my Dad's birthday. Cheers Dad!
It would be great if you had a gluten free cook !!!! Besides cook books for us ppl with gluten issues. I am sure Food Network can find someone who is will to teach us great food !
I really enjoy Giada, Barefootcontessa. Paula Dean and Rachael Ray. The Neely's are pretty good too. I lean towards more healthier ways of cooking.
Dear Food Network.... I maybe just one person, but im thinking a show about old fashion cast iron / dutch oven cooking... The kind of cooking found on the old trail drive buy a man named cooky....
just saw a commercial for 'Ice Brigade', is this for real? *shakes head*
I went to buy Claire Robinson's cookbook, only to be disappointed to find that, to me, her book is contrary to her 5 ingredent concept. Meaning that the recipies in her book, seem to me to be kind of high-end recipies. I would think that the point of just 5 ingredients, means simplicity more than otherwise. I wish she would come out with a book with simple everyday recipies, using only 5 ingredients. Anyone agree??
Would like to see some "salt free" recipes...not everyone likes salt for flavor and not everyone can have salt...anyone else agree with me?
Dear Chef, friends and Food Lovers. I will be judging again on Iron Chef America for a new episode this Sunday February 20, 2011 at 9 PM Central Time. Set your Dvr and let me know your thought on the episode. Ciao and enjoy the show
At a Starbucks in Bluffton, SC of all places...go f*ckn figure LMAO---i recognized him from his many shows on the Food Network, my favorite being Restaurant Impossible & Dinner Impossible!!!

I'm Cooking on Q with Jane Treacy tonight at 6pm ET, and then In the Kitchen with David at 8pm. What a night! I'm giving David a break from Brussies tonight - letting him rest his palate. ;) I've got three beautiful hard anodized pans, the ever-popular (and adorable) Technique Flame soup bowls and a brand new, very cool knife (like no other knife I have). Tune in!
http://www.30days30waysmacandcheese.com/?p=1085 Day 28 was made for David ; )
Hi Meredith, I am looking for a pizza pan but don't recall seeing one on QVC? I wrote to David about this recently. Maybe you could come up with one in Technique?
Someone on the Q's Community Q & A is asking about a Chocolate/Caramel/Sea Salt that was demo'd on a silicone baking sheet I must have missed it, but sounds like a bark w/ caramel and sea salt. Do you have a recipe I can share with them? Thanks!!
So the big Brussels Sprouts challenge for David Venable QVC will come to an end tomorrow on QVC In the Kitchen with David! I'm giving it my best shot! Hope you tune in for the big 5 hour show!
Hi Everyone! Don't forget to tune into QVC today at 2pm ET to watch my good friend, Eric Theiss with all his cool tools and smart solutions under the Prepology brand. He's fun to watch too!
Making Honeybell Marmalade right now. The house will smell fantastic all day!
So... how do you think David managed last night without a dose of Brussels sprouts?? I bet he missed them! :))
I'm on QVC in a show called Antonella's Family Kitchen tonight at 6pm. Antonella is pretty hilarious, so it's bound to be a good watch! Then, I'm back with David at 9pm on my never-ending (or so I suspect) quest to get him to like Brussels sprouts. This time, I'm using Genevieve's idea of pizza! Will this be the winner?
Got Chocolate?

Strength Training and high protein diets are very synergistic. In fact, it's key for fat loss. Consider this: a pound of muscle burns 20 calories per hour while a pound of fat burns 9 calories per hour. By putting on 10 pounds of muscle and losing 10 pounds of fat you have created a major metabolic shift.
Vitamin D is one of the most important, yet neglected supplements you should be taking. In fact, if you live north of Atlanta you are most likely deficient. Interestlingly, Vit D deficiency has been linked with Auto Immune disorders like MS. The further north you go(less sunshine) the more cases of MS you see.

Everyday we are exposed to plastics, metals and various chemicals that can cause serious health problems.

Snowy days are cozy. Snowy days with Nabisco Cookies and milk are even cozier. Agree?
does nabisco make a chocolate wafer still.....??? 
I can never print these coupons. It keeps saying printer is set to keep printed documents. I go in, uncheck it, click save, and still get the same message. I go back and there it is, the box is magically checked again. Any ideas?
The "cookies & milk" tab isn't working. It just keeps searching, is anyone else having troubles?
milk and cookies
why not make the coupon available here instead of having to download a program to get it ....
I just bought Fig Newtons on my trip to Publix but will be buying more cookies. 
How is being friens with you on Facebook getting me better coupons than you are putting out to just anyone. What happened to the free cookies? I am just saying...
cookies and Milk do go together thank -you so much Kathy W
So, I am a huge Nabisco fan, but your new "Chips ahoy" packaging had some issues. The cooki on the front cover is Completely out of focus!?!?!? a style choice?
What is going on with the graham crackers? Something has changed an my other graham loving friends have noticed too. It's not good. They taste weird and they are not as crispy as they used to be :( 
Valentines Day is one week away! Get a head start on yummy holiday treats with these fun and decorative CHIPS AHOY! Sweetheart Valentines Cookies.
sorbetico sorbetico sorbetico!!! DODE ESTA LA SORBETICO???
as a kid I remember my mom buying us these HUGE Oreo cookies. There were like 6 cookies individually wrapped. They had so much cream in the middle it almost made you sick to eat the whole cookie. What ever happened to them?
My favorite memory of eating Nabisco cookies is having my husband buy fig newtons as the first thing he bought for me after we were married. This is a family tradition. The first thing my father bought my mother after they were married was fig newtons, so all of my siblings have followed suit for good luck!
I always miss the date...bummer!
Okay, when are you guys bringing back the "Ideal Peanutbutter Logs" ? The best cookie you ever made. Please, please, please....
Since I was a young girl my grandmother gave me ZWIEBACK cookies with Greek coffee. I have a graving for this and use to be able to go buy it in Stop and Shop. It stopped selling it. That is terrible. I finally found a sweet swiback at an international store in New London. That was after I bought a case from amazon and dumped in garbage.
Show us how your creative Valentines Day recipes turned out share your pictures on the Wall!
My profile pic is a good example of how my Valentine's was. :)
Feb. 19 is National share a cookie day! Because sharing a cookie is like sharing a smile!
why did you change the coupons to just 1 dollar?
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE NABISCO TOASTETTES(POP TARTS) COME BACK!! IF I COULD MAKE THEM, I WOULD, LOL!! APPLE, BLUEBERRY, AND STRAWBERRY FLAVORS! ONES WITH THE SUGAR CRYSTALS ON TOP! HOW MANY OF YOU WANT THEM BACK?
Whatever happened to Mister Salty pretzels? I used to love them! I know that they're in Handi-Snacks, but what about the sticks, bags, boxes, etc.?
I am obsessed with Oreo Cakesters,but they are very pricey. Where can I find any coupons??
Do you prefer your Fig Newtons with coffee or tea?
Please bring back chocolate snaps!
Actually I would prefer milk with a cup of coffee
Aw I missed out on Feb coupons! I just heard about it today!!
WHY STORES KEEP TAKING THE OATMEAL OFF SHELVES AND SELL EVERY NOW AND THEN, I NEED TO KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND THEM?
Congratulations on the Oreo win in the Nascar Nationwide race today with Tony Stewart!

You know what I really miss? Lemon Coolers....

With Spring on the horizon, here are a few basic water saving ideas - what do you do? Share! 
With the leaving of Mubarak and the hand off of control of Egypt to the military, it just might be a good time for Obama to get himself a Director of National Intelligence with enough sense to Google something before commenting on it -- Sheesh!!!!
Obama's czars are unelected, non-reviewed and unconfirmed by Congress -- essentially a shadow government usurping Cabinet responsibilities and accountable to no one except the Executive branch -- now the question, will these czars work for free?
The midwest is getting hammered . . . again. Stay safe and warm out there folks, and we'll keep the good thoughts coming. Sure is hard to jump start an economy when folks can't get to work!
The Obama administration is requesting that the federal judge who ruled Obamacare totally unconstitutional tell the states that they have to begin implementing it anyway . . . essentially that they have to enact an unconstitutional law. Anyone in the White House that can read and understand a legal brief?

Just though I'd share today's Valentine's special with all of you food lovers! Right here in little old Douglas Michigan...
My view on this crazy Chicago morning! Who else is having a snow day? Share your pics with me! -Kristen
Got approved for a card on Feb 1 [tuesday]. Email said I should receive my card within 5 - 7 days. So... are did they mail it off on the 1st or the 2nd or Discover take their time? Just curious because I am leaving for vacation, and I would LOVE to have that card when I go on my vacation.
When I browse "Redeem Cashback Bonus" for gift cards, I do not like the way the sort works for "by Best Value". It does it in absolutes: "Extra $20", "Extra $15", "Extra $10", and "Extra $5". This is not a good representation of value, as $20->$25 is not the same value proposition as $45->$50. This wastes a lot of my time every time I go to browse redemption options. Instead of "Extra $5" it should say, "Extra 25%" or "Extra 11%" for the example mentioned above. This would save a ton of my time, and would also reduce unnecessary reproduction of the same store's gift cards on both the "Extra $5" and "Extra $10" pages for the ones that have both $20->$25 and $40->$50.
Discover is the worst credit card I ever had. I feel so bad having this card. This company does not provide the service what they promise to the customers. I wish I could close my account but do not want to mess up with my credit history because of this card.
I am here to publicly announce my disappointment that there wasn't a new "Peggy" add running for the Superbowl. I had high hopes. LOVE those ads; so well done.
If you see my call history to your customer service people regarding cash back bonus, how they made me frustrated with their responses. Because of your customer service people who are full of with arrogant and proud, I stopped using your discover card. Until and unless, you can not develop the feelings in general customers that it is customers' card, you are never going to be successful. Hope this will help you further why I stopped using your card.
Got an email for Discover ~ SAD!!!! Company is changing the rules on the MOTIVA card effective May 1!!! Rule were pay on time for 6 months and get a Month's finance charge back - GREAT REWARD. I BRAGGED about this card everytime I pulled out my $50 Chilis card that I paid $45 from the bonus with! Now it's every month and you only get 5% of your interest charged - bad move!!!! Nothing to brag about now. very unhappy.
Fashion Alert: Discovers trademark orange is currently the it color! What?! Yep, you heard it hear first...or maybe you also saw the WSJ article http://on.wsj.com/gyEbZJ - either way, orange pride has finally hit the runway. So in the name of fashion strut your stuff and post a pic of you embracing your inner orange. -Kristen
If you had a lunch date with Peggy, where would you take him? http://bit.ly/fkC0DR 
I'm a big fan of my Discover Card, but please, please make those awful "Peggy" commercials go away!
I was recently approved for a Discover Essentials card but can't find that card or offer on the Discover website. I would like to know more about this card. Is there anyone that has had this offer and that has any information to share?
I was solicited last year to open a Discover account. I called and discussed the features with Cust. Serv. and was told my after promotion interest rate would be 9.9%. A follow-up phone call from Discover confirmed the terms and approval, including the settled rate of 9.9%. My initial promotion rate of 0.0% has now expired and Discover is charging me 19.9% on my balance, despite their representation and confirmation, and my perfect payment history with them. Calls to Cust. Serv. yield only being told that I must now plead my case with some unilateral review process of theirs, and abide by that decision. This is not the ethical standard I am used to in business and not one I am willing to accept. The notion that the onus is on me to correct their ethics is absurd. I am paying my balance off and will consider this a lesson learned. I could not, in good conscience, recommend Discover to anyone
I lost my job in 2009 and I lost all my credit card and Discover was one of them but I'm going to fix my credit and after I fix it... How many years I have to wait so I can apply it again? I mean even if my credit is fix but on Discover sistem it well appear that I had a card that went lost...
I saw a few hints of this season's "it" color, orange on the Red Carpet last night! Who would you nominate as Oscar's best dressed?

would like to thank all the VERY HARD-WORKING Team Members of O'Reilly Auto Parts for really stepping up these last couple days & taking care of everyone in need of auto parts & supplies! I know this weather has been a real pain, but I'm proud of all of you for sticking with it!!! 
If you are in Temecula don't take your drums and rotors to get turned at the Temecula Parkway location! Drop off my drums and rotors at 10 am they said It would be about 1:30 to 2:00 hours, just like many times in the past, no problem. Get no phone call so I head over about 2:30 hours later and only the rotors are done. So they run around trying to see who can turn the drums and they tell me that they are going to work on them now and they will call me for sure when they are done.
My 1984 Olds Cutlass had this car since 1999,kept it longer than any car I have ever had,rebuilt a rocket 350,chromed it up,still got some work to do on the car it will get done in time.

Your Vanilla Hemp Milk is the best. I found it works wonders on my acid reflux - instant relief. Thank you.
I LOVE your Creamy Tomato Soup. So tasty, so easy to heat up, and good for you!! I bought in bulk at Costco thinking I'd never get through all six boxes and they were gone in less than a month. And I live alone :)
I Live In Las Vegas NV, Where Could I Find Pacific Rice And Almond Milk, There's Is Only One Albertson's Location That Sells It But It's Too Far Away From Me Do U Have Any Idea Of Where I Could Find Those Products Somewhere Else Besides The Internet Of Course? BTW I Live On The 89169 Zip Code Area 
Where can I find the Vanilla Hemp milk in Colorado Springs? If it does wonders for acid-reflux, I will definitely buy it!
I live in the Twin Cities, MN. I am having a really hard time finding your Hemp Milk. There is a local competing product, but they aren't as good. :P Any help as to where I can find it? I have searched just about every health store I can find. Thanks!
Love your soups!
I love the Almond Milk!

I love your chicken broth-add some chicken and veggies and voila meal in minutes! 
What happened to the sweet corn soup? Can't find it anymore..

love your tasty soups. such healthy and convenient additions to my diet. thanks.
I <3 your almond milk!!! I never drink any other brand.
I just wanted to say how grateful I am for your soups - especially that they are gluten free. We go through a lot of the creamy tomato soup at our house. I prefer a tangier tomato soup rather than creamy, so I mix a small can of tomato sauce with the carton of soup and it's fabulous.

I need everyone's help. I have been fighting for a Tennessee "Pickle Bill".

If you would help in this, please send a message to me. Thanks. shipleyfarm34@yahoo.com From Heather Shipley "The Pickle Lady"
Hi Guys, This is Billy Wright From Poplar Grove Farms. I will be selling at the Market this season. I am looking forward to a good year and I have lots of awesome plants to offer, all of which were grown on my farm.

I really like the Blue Runner Red Beans that taste like it is home made. But it does not indicate that it contains POTASSIUM, and that is very important to have. I look at all items and observe of what they contain before they go in my mouth. Everyone should do that no matter what the price is. Basically All other Brands like Bush's Dark Red Kidney Beans contains 400mg of POTASSIUM in it. I still rather like the Blue Runner better, but would like to know why they don't have Pottassium in it. Sterling
Love blue runner the spicy red beans are better than popeyes 
honeybaked ham northshore now has a fb page!!! check it out! we love adding a ham bone to blue runner!!! yum

we eat Blue Runner beans every week ,for the last 30 years......love them RedBeans,infact had some tonight with fried frog legs,yummy !!
I would rather white beans. They are sooo good over rice.
Smother down an onion or two, (depends on the size of the cans ) three cans of red or white beans and cook for about 1 hr. If you want add some sausage to your red beans. A fast meal but the best tasting beans. Try the gumbo this is also great.
We have not been able to find your Bean Soup anymore. Did you stop making it? It was so delicious!!! We cannot wait for all of the new products! If they are as good as your gumbo, I will just stop cooking and use all of your products!! Why waste my time when you are cooking for us!?
Blue Runner donated beans last week to the Haiti Project with the mission that Sister Martha Ann Abshire started 20 years ago. She has been given enough product to feed 7000 meals. The product along with Sister Abshire should be in Haiti this week.

This was made with Blue Runner Foods new Creole Jambalaya Base!! You take 1 and 1/2 cups dry rice, 1 lb of your fav jambalaya meat (I used just over a pound of bratwurst) and this can of base. Bring to a boil, simmer 20 minutes and serve! I added some diced tomatoes on the side (family preferance) or you can add in the pot. 8 yo son said it was real good and not too spicy!!

I made the Blue Runner Jambalaya today. I did just as the can said: 1 1/2 c. rice 1 lb. sausage ( I added andouille smoke sausage) I added 1 can Italian stewed tomatoes ( because we like them) Bring to a boil, reduce heat,cover and simmer for 20mins.... stirring occasionally It cooked for the 20mins and it was ready! The aroma was so delicious when it was cooking! It has such a great taste. I didn't have to add any seasonings at all. Just the right spices!!!! Thanks so much!!

Blue Runner is thinking about running a contest where the winner gets red beans for LIFE! What do you think?
Sorry there were no winners on the Super Bowl contest. A few of you were close until Steelers went for 2.
Thanks Blue Runner this was a Great way to advertise and lots of fun I enjoy cooking and using your products I make an awesome Red Bean Gumbo using your beans it has Won First place!!!! Good Luck to All!!!!
GREAT PRODUCT. AND IT IS A LOCAL COMPANY. LOVE THEIR BEANS RED AND WHITE...........
Thanks Cynthia for passing on our message.
I love your canned beans compared to fresh ones homemade
I love Blue Runner Red Beans , the BEST. I buy them by the case when they come on sale. 
I purchase a case everytime I visit family in Lutcher, Paulina and Gonzales Louisiana and drag them up to Columbus, Oh.....the shipping directly from Blue Runner is too high, but the reps on the phone have always been delightful and helpful. Still think nothing is as good as home made red beans, but these are great for a quick supper and seasoned just right! Great company, in my opinion.
It just takes a minute to report and this is great. Come on friends....
When we go on trips camping we give friends we meet some good ole Blue Runner beans!!!! A touch of Louisiana cooking!
We love Blue Runner Cream Style Red Beans for red beans and rice!
When you are in a rush for dinner these beans taste as good as fresh beans . All you need is a little onoins and pickel pork or taso and they are the bees knees!
We recommend Blue Runner beans to all of our friends. They are so good and creamy. My wife wishes Blue Runner would do the same with all of the other beans, too. Keep on putting them out - just awesome!!!!!!
Just ordered 8 cans of Red beans. Can't wait to get them in the mail!
One of the best foods on earth!!! - Love these beans!!! - Wishing my sister could get them in Edmonton Alberta Canada....she bought some when she was "down home" a few weeks ago and told me to "shush yur mouth" when I told her I about to open a couple of cans and adding some sausage today...
Love Blue Runners. One of the perks of my job is working right next to their place on Burnside in Gonzales. I get the joy of smelling them cooking those wonderful red beans every morning as I'm walking in to my office!!
How do you get to become part ft The Blue Runner Tasting Team?
 How do you get to become part of The Blue Runner Tasting Team?

I received my package of your Gumbo base yesterday!!! Thank you so much. I am soooo excited. I am going to buy some seafood and make some gumbo with it this weekend! Can't wait. . . I know it will be awesome! Yummy!!! 
I love blue runner red beans
I'm waiting anxiously for my Gumbo Base and Jambalya base hope I Get it SOON!
The Blue Runner red beans i just received in the mail from New Orleans Showcase. Only 2 cans were dented, i'm so happy I can eat them again!!
My son Derek, enjoying some Blue Runner beans!
In Tennessee, we have a Sonic chicken! : )
My husband and I were disappointed with the new Sonic in Streamwood, IL. We went thru the drivethru and when we got home we didn't get what we ordered. Then I had to run back and the girl at the register thought I was crazy. Just bad customer service in my book.
will sonic ever get the fried pickles again?
Are there any plans to expand into the Washington, DC area?? There's a great empty lot in downtown Falls Church, VA, that is just CRYING out for a Sonic - right on a main road, and right down the street from my house!! Became addicted when we lived in Texas, and have been missing you ever since we moved back to DC...
I just put like so I could tell you that I had the nastiest Chicken Dinner meal at Sonic today. Not sure what gravy stuff was. I would have been better off getting a chicken dinner from the discount grocery store. Barfability rating of 8 only because the fries, token onion ring and soda were good.
Looking forward to Carhopping in the SNOW for the first time this Thursday and Friday! We so rarely see it this far south in Texas... One of my regulars commented this morning that I could skate, serve, and snowball, all at the same time!!! :D
Great Food & a Feeling Of The Old 50's
Sonic has the BEST ice-tea! Even in sub zero temperatures - it is still the best. I like to order a Route 44 unsweetened ice tea with 3 lemon slices and sweetner and then mix it with a lemon slushy.
Your store in richmond missouri sucks. the last 15 times i went my tots where cold and my drink tasted like dish water. for that reason i have stopped going. i have told the manager. but they said there was nothing they can do about it. well i can do something. cook the tots and test the soda and flavor addition.
any plans on opening a sonic in northwest indiana???......the last time we were at the one in south bend (yes, we drove all the way there....45 min... just for sonic), they said one was supposed to be built in portage, in. still no sign of one anywhere! :-)
Any plans to stop using ammonia treated hamburger meat? I really miss a yummy Sonic burger! That used to be one of my favorite treats. 
Ok if national tator tot day are they on sale or free
well if u"ll want 2 c a real carhop in valdosta check me out on north bemiss rd...im the only skater.... an on wensdays on hwy 84...cum c me now u hear...
Hi Sonic. I am very sad that i purchased gift certs and they weren't activated. And then when i contacted local, i had to bring them in to activate. And I'd sent them out of town. And corporate said to 'get the numbers'. Seriously? I gave them to teenagers. Just saying that i will never buy sonic gift certs again. Too much trouble when the local folks screw up. 
Any plans to bring back the fried pickles? Those would be great snack for happy hour!
is there a sonic in billings montana yet
When is the sonic going to open up on fort lauderdale beach
Today is national "Wear Red" day. Maybe I'll slip over to Sonic for a luscious Red Velvet Cheesecake blast... I always end up wearing my order the rest of the afternoon! :-)
Please bring back the Sweetheart shake!! It has been a favorite February tradition of mine for years...:(
i have to send a shout out to the commerce, MI sonic crew!!! i braved the snow today because i NEEDED a cherry coke.. i got stuck in a snow drift and they came out to help push me out!!! more reasons to love sonic!!!!!
Shout out to sonic come back crew!! Dr.Pepper games 2011!
sorry to say, but disappointed in red velvet cheescake blast.....good but not what I wanted it to be!
You know what goes great with the Super Bowl?? An Apple Juice Slush! 
tip your skaters!
Thanks SONIC for the Philly Cheesesteak that looks just like it does in the picture. Epic FAIL!
lol right now i want fries with cheese! tha bomb!
Wow I seriously hate that Sonic in my town, Kirbyville Texas stopped serving the chicken strip meal in a box or the pop corn chicken. Two favorite menu items of my family. However, I hate more, making an order, repeating the order, waiting for the order, paying for the order and THEN discovering miles away from the Sonic at home... The order is WRONG! I would LOVE for Sonic and for that matter most fast food places to maybe just maybe... Make it look like you care to get it right? Just a little bit of the illusion.. Really...
i love your red velvet cheesecake shake but today I had one where I could still see the food coloring lingering and the chunks were hard. =(
due to limited location in SOCAL it was my first time last sunday that i ever tried the sonic double chees burger & red velvet cheescake ice cream..... damn , it was so freakin' good......
sonics gave away free popcorn chicken and i declined 
Thanks for the new Sonic coupons in my inbox today, kiddos really love Sonic and I love the Freezing sizzling drinks!
i just got back for sonic
Have you tried the new all beef hot dogs? My MIL had to call me to let me know that my nephew, who just turned 3, ate two of them all by himself! She takes him out to eat once a week. That was last week. As soon as she got him in the car this week and pointed and said, "Sonic!" Smart kid. 
i grew up eatin sonic. i can still remember the little glass animals on my soda... wat ever happened to those. sonic is the best fastfood anywher
Just got my certified skating carhop pin last night :)
how do you make a cherry limeaide slush?
someone just asked me if i could make them :0a PICKLE JUICE slush! :0
You know I <3 you, Sonic, but it's just too painful to keep being your Facebook friend when you have no plans to come see me (or, you know, the EIGHT MILLION other people) in NYC. So long, buddy. :C
Sonic needs to bring back the Steak Finger basket. I miss it very much. It's been way too long. Even if just for a limited time only this summer. I'm tired of having to go to DQ and then back to Sonic for my Route 44 strawberry vanilla Dr Pepper.
I really wish they would bring back the sweetheart brownie blast it was the best
I have been hearing rumors that you are coming to Long Island? How true are they and when will we see Sonic on LI? 
When is the Fort Lauderdale Beach Sonic opening? It's been under construction FOREVER!!
Bring back the Pink Lady & Pickle'os..... I used to live on that for lunch in highschool. Good times!!! YUM!
Had a red velet cheesecake blast, WAS GREAT!!
Im a msplaced okee from ardmore Oklahoma missing my sonic drive in got my first job there and fell in love with the footlong cheese chili coney dog I live in NW indiana and wish they would put one here
Mmmmmm..mmmm..mmm - Jus Sayin ;)
Hello! My name is Emily I've been a carhop at my wonderful Sonic location for almost a year. I was just wondering if any other carhops could share how they answer the speaker. I have the plain ol, "thank you for choosing Sonic, my name is Emily! How may I help you!" But I switched it up a bit and have been saying "welcome to the wonderful world of sonic where we make all your fast food dreams come true! My name is Emily, how may I help you!" I enjoy interacting w the guest in a way that makes them enjoy their time on our property a little bit more, and come back over and over again! So.....that being said does anyone have any opening lines intros that I could use for my sonic career enjoyment? Thank you! Have a great weekend!! (^-^)
It's me, Emily again! Ok I have worked at Sonic for almost a year, and I think this summer I'm gonna skate! Aah, I'm a quick learner and I'm so excited......I already know how to skate....(who doesn't?) but I imagine balancing say...2 route 44s, a watermelon creamslush, a popcorn chicken wacky pack (w balloon), a bcbtstr, ckn ranch wrp, rings, bites, and 2 jr candy sundaes is a lot diff than JUST skating! Any advice for me??!
well you know its bad when you put in years with the company and you get sick and callin one day to tell them youre not any better and that you are going back to doctor next day and you suppose to be at work instead your in doctors office and just because you didnt call them back they terminate you come on please;;;;;and i was an asst.manager of one of thier locations in misssiisppi 
after a long day at work i tried a Coke with White coconut!! its amazing!!!
finally we got a SONIC within reasonable distance... randallstown!!! juhu... this will be out valentines date! LOVE IT
so im trying to get a job at sonic and i was wondering do they allow facial piercings if ur working as a cook
Just went to Sonic " WOW " love the woman on skates
heya m cumin soon 2 visit u SONIC !!!!!
I NEED TO KNOW IF THE PLANS FOR THE SONICS IN FORT LAUDERDALE BEACH CHANGED, BECAUSE I HATE THAT I HAVE TO GO TO WPB OR EVEN ORLANDO JUST FOR SONICS!! WE NEED ONE SOON!!! SOMEONE LET ME KNOW PLEASE!!!!
My husband and I tried ur Sausage breakfast croissant this morning for the 1st time, they were ok but must say we were very disappointed in the egg...very rubbery and tasted...kinda ...I don't know...fake? I guess. But kudos on the sausage flavor there was really good.
What changed about the coney dog? My wife and I just ordered them and we both took several bites of ours and looked at each other and said eww it taste salty and like it was cooked in cooking oil!
This is Jackie Ramsey from Simpsonville SC sonic. I want everyone to know what type of boss I have.I have been withSonic almost 2 years. I work hard and try to get along with all.Ronnie and Dustin Riddle have seen me work and heard my mouth. But my manager Chris Meadows has always been a good boss. But now he has gone even further. I don't miss time from work but 2 weeks ago tomorrow I carried my husband to the hospital er for severe headaches. We found out 3 hours later he has brain cancer. After being in the hospital for 4 days we find he has brain, lung, and lymph node cancer. the drs. say it will be a miracle if he makes it 3 months. Now granted Hospice has helped. But my boss has taken it upon himself and the whole crew has helped to have a fund raiser for us. I just want everyone to know how special the Simpsonville SC Sonic is and its employees. Thanx again for your prayers and your donations. Jackie Ramsey 49 Dove Lane Fountain Inn SC 29644
Gotta Like MIO Stuff.......[that is Made In OKLAHOMA] ...........besides the $5.99 Brown Bag Special is Great....2 Burgers, 2 Fries, and 2 Drinks....what is Not to Like....Only at SONIC Drive-ins..........An OKC Based Business...
you know how there is a so you think you can skate competition.. my manager and i think we would rock in "so you think you make pretty ice cream" just saying..
I am very disappointed four Sonic's have closed within 1.5 hour radius around me. I had one 15 minutes from me and it closed and more near me closed. Now I don't know of any Sonic's left in Indiana. I am from Oklahoma, and Sonic was like a part of home in Indiana. They closed in Kokomo, Logansport, Auburn, and Ft. Wayne, IN. They always seemed busy and definitely had my business. Are there any still in Indiana, and why are they closing up? 
08:12:00 02/14/11 I asked for #13 combo with sweet tea with lemon. Upon inspecting the tea he told me "you have to specify lemon in your order"(like I said I asked for it at the ordering station). To put fuel on the fire he told me lemon is extra. Sonic, if you're going to charge extra for lemon in the south you need to make it plain on your sign at the drive in....or at least have the order takers mention it when they take the orders.
Speedway 704-979-0380 in Concord, NC. Staff this location so that manager doesn't have to do EVERYthing. Overcooking the eggs is not good.
I'll have the bacon cheeseburger toaster sandwich with a mocha shake.....only the sandwich please not the meal. I can't do this too often but damn this is a good burger. It has onion rings and a special sauce that I don't really need to know about.
My Sonice Bacon Cheeseburger sure would be good with some BACON! 
This is for Sonic 25502 Jeronimo Rd, Mission Viejo, CA 92691 Dear Sonic, Friday night could have been a huge disaster for you, but due to the WONDERFUL OUTSTANDING and overall BEST MANAGER that I have ever come into contact with disaster was averted but not because of the food but because it was handled correctly. When a customer requests no tomatoes on her food, usually there is a reason why. In my case it is because I have an allergy, an allergy that will close my airway, make the inside of my mouth swell up, my tongue puffy, and then my gums hurt depending on how much contact I come in with. contin...
Friday night we stopped in at the drive thu to order our food, and I ordered mine without tomatoes, I even repeated it and had him repeat it back to me to be safe, but AFTER I took a bite guess what??? I luckily missed the evil thing itself and got the bread and meat with just some tomato juice in my mouth. I immediately called and talked to BARRY who then rushed out to make sure that I was fine. He expressed his concern, offered me soda water to rinse (his wife has an avocado allergy so he understood) made me a new burger, gave us our money back, and 'smacked' the guys in the kitchen around for not being able to read a screen correctly. contin....
Barry was wonderful! He checked on us at least three times to make sure i didn't need to go to the ER, and apologized so very much for something that he had no control over. He took down my contact info, and I took down the Sonic number promising to call the next day. (I tried to call but was on hold for 10min... so I am writing it here instead) Even his coworker Michelle was wonderful, she checked on us 2x and was very concerned and upset that this could have happened. With this allergy I have had situations like this before, but NEVER has a manager gone so far and above what I was expecting in being polite and understanding. Thank you Barry!!!! contin......
But Sonic! This could have been a HUGE disaster! After I went home, I did have a slight swell in my mouth (for I am allergic to the acid, so much that even if it was on the meat then removed I would still react but not as badly as taking a bit into it itself) and was slightly uncomfortable for the weekend. (no hard foods like chips etc) This could have all been avoided if the people making the food would have read the screen correctly. I usually check my food anyway but burgers like yours with the meat and bread and lettuce hang all the way out so to check would mean opening it all the way out and making a mess. contin.....
 Why should I have had to do that if I ordered it, repeated it, and had you repeat it back to me? I hope you let Barry know how wonderful he was, and also Michelle how caring she was to us. But those boys in the kitchen need to learn, my BF was so very upset with them and if I would have gone to the ER we would be singing another tune right now. The Tomato Girl (what Barry has named me @ Sonic MV) 
I love your cherry lime chiller!!!!!!! Soooooooo gooooooooood!!! Mandy Mason
cherry
is mad at sonic... went to one on rt 46, northern NJ... I should have went thru the drive thru cause this would have never happened... a 40 min wait for two shakes... thats it...... I watched people who came after us got there food first... we had to tell someone twice... I would have left if I hadn't already paid outside on the menu board... NOT HAPPY... I had just wanted my money back then while I was being told I had to wait longer to get my money back..... one of the car hops made them while we waited for the manager, who didn't seem to care, cause him/her never came out.. Makes me never want to go there again due to how we were over looked and ignored.
I WORK AT SONIC IN ARKANSAS AND IT IS JUST GREAT! 
wanna try something awesome? eat the redvelvet blast with oreos instead of cheesecake! its uhhhhmazing!
Thanks to the Lugoff, SC Sonic. We were just there for Sonic Night for our local elementary school. Our Sonic routinely hosts Sonic Night to help all of our local schools raise money. Tonight the money raised is being donated to Relay for Life. Thanks for taking an active role in our community!
I usually love sonic I go to the one in hainesport nj but the food is getting worse and worse and today just put me over the edge I ordered a regular grilled chicken sandwhich it was horrible the chicken tastes like rubber and the bun was burnt I will not be going to a sonic ever again
BRING THE RED VELVET CHEESECAKE BLAST BACK!!!!! 
We need some Sonic's in Northern Virginia!!!!!
Loved the new Chicago Dog at my Belen, NM Sonic! Went even better with my Rt 44 Diet Coke with Lime Wedges YUMMY!!!!
really? north babylon? but you couldn't just put one in l.a.? we had to drive allllll the way to bakersfield
I love cream slushes...so far I've tried the strawberry, orange and cherry they are all sooo good! 
Fourteen years in Northern Virginia - no Sonic! God is good. I moved to the Tidewater and have a Sonic five min. from the house. Raspberry sweet tea all the time, baby! Gotta love it. Thanks Sonic!
Route-44 cherry-vanilla Dr Pepper. Sonic in castle hills, san antonio is good. Although they didnt answer the button.
We need a sonic in Northwest Indiana. We have just about every thinkable restaurant here and no Sonic. HELP!!!
We have a Sonic 2 min. from our house on the space coast FL. The food is great,just like everything they have. The only complaint I have is that they are so slow that it is impossible to get your lunch there when you have a short lunch hr.
Dear Sonic guy In Columbus, GA...thanks for giving me a cracked cup for my Red Velvet Cheesecake Blast...and covering the crack with Sonic stickers so that I wouldn't notice until I had red velvet ice cream leaking all over my shirt......FAIL!
what ever happened to the holiday window stickers for .99 sodas? It made me feel special to have one
My family and I went to the Sonic's in Rancho Cucamonga,CA. What a disappointment. The shakes look so good on TV. I can get some soft serve vanilla ice cream and sprinkle snickers on it just as good. The pictures on the menu are very different than what you actually get.
Made my first visit to the local Sonic on Wednesday. I ordered a meal with a side of apple slices, which is a great alternative. Too bad the apples' expiration date was LAST WEEK. I hope my food will be fresh next time.
i don't get it..i went to the sonicdrive.com to enter my coade for the matchmaker game and there isn't a link or place to enter the code...can you give me some tips?
Ive worked at the sonic drive in, in chanute ks for going on 5 years! Im a carhop customers enjoy to have!
Was at the sonic at 3375 North Gloster St. In Tupelo,MS. Tried to get a ice cream cone at 1130 pm and was told the place was closed. Sign said they don't close till midnight...trash service.
Hey you all gotta do something about your franchise in Trinidad, CO ... every time I order a chicken strip dinner from you all its because I'm getting an onion ring AND gravy ... if not I would just go to Dairy Queen .... try explaining this the them lol thank you for listening to my rant ;)
I drove 70 miles round trip to go to Sonic last night! When are you opening a Sonice in the Fort Lauderdale area??? I'm dying here!
does anyone know on the sonic website where u can play the matchmaker game??
What's your favorite SONIC Blast flavor? OREO, M&M's, Reese's Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups, Butterfinger or Snickers?
how do i play the match maker game i get codes off food and there isnt a place to play on sonicdrivein.com
I really wish the Pinacolada slush would come back. That was my all time favorite flavor. 
the new hot dogs are yummy & the packaging is a hoot. 100% All Beef Preview!
I have been a sonic skating car hop for my whole highschool career in nevada missouri. I would love the opportunity to be on a sonic commercial! Every mystery shop i have been involved in i have recieved a 100+%!!!!! :) check me out sonic!!!!!!
Sonic is my favorite! I ate foot longs with slaw, Mayo, and jalepoenes only for years, Now that they don't have slaw, I eat a Super Sonic with Cheese Mayo L&T'. It Rocks!!!!
i LOVEEE your route 44 cherry vanilla dr pepper with extra real cherry's. get one every morning! :)
I live 2 blocks away a Sonic in ok. And I love happy hour. Route 44's Lemon~Berry Slush,H-C Punch Slush as well. Plus the great coupons I get the mail. I Save a lot on ordering my food wh them...
Where do I enter the codes for the Match Maker game?

Hey Sonic, this summer, will you be bringing back the campfire blast??? I miss it!
I have a few questions .... 1. Do you still have the Red Velvet Cheesecake Blast? 2. IF so, how long will is still be on the menues? 3. Is there a way to search for the Sonics in the state? 'Cause there's none in our area code.
Too bad your south Huntsville, AL location doesn't have your promotional Red Velvet Cheesecake Blast!

OMG.. just had one of your new Chicago style beef hot dogs. DELICIOUS!
Sonic in Brentwood Tn. is absolutely the worst sonic I have ever been to! I went at 1030 on sat Feb 26th 2011 and every parking spot was taken by teenagers hanging out in the middle not ordering not spending money like I would have had i had a spot to order. I got out of my car and tried to order from a walk up, the order taker acted like he could not hear me, 5 times i tried to place my order and 5 times i got what. The one thing that was heard was when i asked the store #. i will be back to this sonic only one more time and that is to talk to their management about the going ons of last night.
you guys need to do somethin about the stores in alamogordo and ruidoso, new mexico. half the time the cooks dont care about the food they prepare for your customers. they sometimes get the orders wrong and when a person orders a burger it usually comes out burnt. now mind you, these are pretty good locations but these things have been happening as of late and it needs to be fixed
Wish your mobile website had the matchmaker game on it.
Why was there no Sweetheart Shake this year? My 28 shakes n 28 days tradition was ruined.
Wishing we had a Sonic closer to us here in Washington state. The closest one is over 40 miles away!!! me some Sonic!
I am so upset...i am still seeing commercials and ads for my red velvet cheesecake blast and nobody around me has them anymore...yall shouldve kept that one longer :(
Sonic MANAGER, when I see a customer behind me in the drive-thru deny a drink b/c it's not what they ordered, don't try to give it to me and lie to my face when I say, "That's the cup that just came from that other guest's car". GROSS. Make me a new one, or I will gladly report you to Sonic Corporate.
I just got a $1.00 off coupon on Premium Beef Hot Dog Combo! So Cool! 
Being from Chicago I sure do miss my Chicago Dogs. Glad Sonic got them, very good. Not as good as Portillo's but do great for that craving from home.
I love you Sonic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the coney and tots and burgers FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bring back the red velvet cheesecake blast back !!!!
Meet Sonic's "Chicken Tender Dinner." Four chicken tenders, fries, gravy and Texas toast. As you can see from this picture of the one I just bought, by "tender" they mean "nugget," and by "Texas toast" they mean "toast that's thinner than regular toast." Throw in cold fries, white gravy that's been well-aged to more of a brown color, and no drink, and this nearly $6 combo stacks up to be one of their not-so-great-deal menu items. If I had wanted so little (and cold) food for so much money, I'd've gotten a salad. ;-)
my 2007 birthday burger. made it myself back in 07 when I worked at Sonic. HIRE ME BACK!!!!!!!
Happy Valentine's Day!

It looks like Saturday will be PERFECT weather. Motel Funk will be setting a bluesy feel. Janie Richards, the lead singer, always seems to call on her favorite musician friends to join in to add to their always great sound. We'll also be debuting a story telling event for kids (and parents) over by the stadium.
We'll have some great music this Saturday at Market. The Empty Hats, a longtime Market favorite band, will be playing their infectiously happy Celtic tunes. We'll also have Barby Holder playing traditional songs on the hammered Dulcimer over by the stadium. Looks like lots of sunshine is also on the playbill.
Don't forget come hear about changing the way we eat at USFSP TEDx Manhattan http://www.saturdaymorningmarket.com/cooleremail/feb11newsltr.htm

I consistently and constantly run into trouble emailing invoices from QB 2010 Pro, and previous versions (2007 specifically). Several versions in I thought this would be fixed by now as it is a massive issue that wastes a lot of my time as a business owner. Anyone know why this isn't fluid yet? I'm using Windows 7 64 bit.

After four years of this my fuse is a little short.
Just had a horrible experience with one of your websites customer service people. Love your services, don't like the person I talked to. He was rude, unclear about what he was offering and didn't listen.

does meal train notify the recipient of the meals with updates of who is bringing what and when?
I have benefitted from wonderful people on my community bringing my family and I meals when i had neck surgery a few months back. A site like meal train would have been awesome. I also hope that my friends and family utilize it if they know someone who needs help. I also want to say that I'm not here to use mealtrain to advertise Movable Feast, but I do private chefing and will prepare foods and bring them to your home daily or weekly. If you have questions look at my fb page. Maybe you don't have time to cook for a friend, but would like to send them a a great meal. 
Good News! We just simplified meal giving further by adding a feature that lets you automatically add a booked meal date to your personal calendar (Google, iPhone, iPad, Outlook, etc.). Let us know what you think.

A great way to tell if pasta is done is to cut it in half. If you see any flour, it still needs some time to cook. #kitchentips
Just one of the many reasons to take food (and human) sanitation so seriously, though the article does not confirm that the sandwich was the cause of this man's death: 
Do you love asparagus as much as I do? I love it for its flavor and because it's packed with vitamins like B6, potassium, folic acid and more, especially when steamed. Join me in making these light asparagus burgers for lunch!

My boyfriend and I just finished having dinner for our 3rd anniversary at Eat. It was so wonderful. Our waiter, Mich was absolutely amazing. Although I didn't think I could eat more he talked me into the sweet potato bread pudding with tabasco ice cream. First, I do not like bread pudding. Second, I do not like tabasco. This is by far the best dessert I have ever had in my life. We will be back in March for both of our birthdays and hope to get Mich again. Thank you for helping make our anniversary even more special. 
Robert!! You're so amazing! You're drop dead gorgeous with a heart of Gold! You're just a big teddy bear... with a rock hard body! I love that you're such a sweetheart! Never change because you're so perfect! <3 <3 <3 Nikki
Can you please answer a question for me Chef....why is it that olive oil heats up at a much faster rate then vegetable oil? There is probably a simple reason but I can't figure it out...go figure ;)
Survived the Monster Storm Blizzaster 2011 in Chicago, spent 4 hours digging out, now making a pork roast and smashed potatoes for dinner and waiting to watch KI! Woo Hoo!
omg this si so bad ! I would say I would walk away! you are a strong man feel bad for you on this show, just the first 10 mmin I feel so bad for you!
I'd eat those steaks off that floor...I dont see the big deal ;-)
I think I just puked in my mouth after I saw all those mice! You really should warn your viewers ahead of time. Wow!
Has anyone filed charges against the state/local health department for Rascals, I know they can be under staffed but I can not imagine they never had any complaints anout food poisioning, I think the owner was so close to the forest he could not see the trees and got overwhemed. They are lucky they did not have a fire as well - Guess fire inspections are optional as well. And YEA for the autobody shop, your logistics people are earning every penny this week for sure. Hope Steve can keep his family dream alive
Watching this is more painful than watching the American Idol auditions. Knowing how Robert is and seeing the owner, I am on the edge of my chair to see how he reacts to each new hiccup. Can't wait to see the "update" at the end of the show and see how the restaurant is doing now.
We just got over food poisoning from one of our local places....I feel it coming on again! What a grody place!
Chef Robert I just want to say that you deserve to be called Saint Robert...What a transformation...I have never seen an establishment under such horrendous conditions. its sad to know that Rascals did not remain open and reverted back yo old habits. But I applaud you and all who helped u make a miracle happen!!! Big Hugs and Kudos to you :D
Chef Robert, don't know how you did it, failing was not the word, more like gross. It was there but Steve didn't have the initiative to do anything in years, which took you only two days. Love Taniya, watch her on HG all the time. Loved the turnover though, amazing. Til next time.
Next time on "Hoarders", RASCALS in New Castle, Delaware!! If his restaurant was in that shape, imagine what his house is like!!
I can't imagine the level of frustration at putting the effort into turning these places around, only to have them fail anyhow...I'm guessing that half the places this season go under. Also, I wonder how many are signing up just to get a free makeover, then bail and put the business up for sale... 
Hi Everyone, I own Rascals. What a great job that Robert did!!! What the Food Network neglected to mention was....I am taking time off to take care of my Father. He is 89. He will be moving in with me, and my Family so that I can watch over him. Rascals re-opens February 9th. I must say, thanks to everyone that was a ...part of involved in the show. A very big thank you to Robert, and the Food Network. I will never forget everything that was done to get me back on track. It truly was a life changing experience!!! Thanks Robert!!! 
I live in NJ but not far from Delaware so I pass Rascals often. I remember eating there once when I was a kid back when the place was nice. The show tonight nearly made me vomit. I'm sorry but a normal person could never let a place get like that. He has to be a hoarder and I think he was on the wrong show. If this was just filmed in Oct/Nov and the place has already closed again it's obvious he shouldn't be in the business.
Chris and I watched the show tonight. All I can say is wow. Mainelli's must have been a cakewalk next to this. The place looked great when you were done though. Hopefully once they re-open they will be able to use the momentum you started.
LOVE! Will you be my Valentine??? ;-)
Amazing show tonight, Chef Robert....congratulations for such an amazing turnaround. Hope it goes well for this family. And what a talented designer!
just want to say good night robert i hope you had an awesome day sweet dreams (:
What more can I say than WOW!! I have never seen such! Hurl factor was way beyond imaginable! You did an amazing job! Thank goodness for hidden treasures and the quick wit of the design team and yoursself Chef Robert!
OMG - LOVE Yogi!!!!!! I have his book of "Yogi-isms". What a treasure! I can't imagine cooking without salt? I could skip the sugar much easier than salt, but not BEing able to use both! WOW! As said BEfore and will BE said again.............. Chef, you are AWESOME!!!! BE Well my friend!!!!
I feel the need to be disinfected after watching last night...yuck! I don't think I ever want to eat out again!
Hey Chef Robert! I thought I'd share today. I only recently came across your page here, and honestly thought it would just be a fun little novelty to kill some time. After watching for a while, I was very surprised! The fact that you take time out of your busy life to respond to posts on your page was very unexpected. The kindness and warmth you show everyone is very touching. I'm now infinitely more proud to tell people that you are my favorite chef. :) And then I realized something; I've worked in a bookstore cafe since I graduated college in '09, to support myself and my fiance as he finishes school. I've been half-thinking about going back to school for a while, and it's settled now. I don't know where, or in what capacity, but I've officially decided to attend a culinary school in the near future. I haven't had much motivation to move on to greater things in life since graduation, but I've had a spark of inspiration now - and I'm glad to say it came from you, Chef. :) Thank you.
Hey CHef, remember...give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.......teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime.....Sometimes they just fall out of the boat!!! 
Last nights episode of R.I was disgusting. This guy has no idea how to run a restaurant. Robert, why are you wasting your time on such a losing effort. This was obvious from the beginning. I would prefer to see you focus on those owners who truly have a passion for the business but need some help, not this loser who was too lazy to even maintain basic cleanliness and safe food handling techniques. Your show can do better.
Chef what is the deal on these places your helping? Last week and now this week the owners are just slaming you. I see where Steve's wife is calling you names and saying she is going to sue. Your trying to help but it seems these people never are happy. Best of luck man!!! 
Wow, after watching that....cabin fever (due to the snow set in) made me look around my home and see things that can be tossed. No gym for me yesturday due to the shoveling snow and no gym today....anything not nailed done in this house is gone. Hubby was soooo excited (NOT) when I woke him at 3am saying "Hi, know your sleeping, but that saw thingy in the shed....you ever going to use that?" Seeing stuff like that freaks me out...it's right up there with clowns. I know my home is spotless, but that makes me not want to eat out! I so hope they make it after all your hard work. And my heart goes out to anyone that had to wear the hazzmat suit!
People do things out of the kindess of their hearts, if you fail after that it is not the fault of others, things happen, but and I havent read the comments from the owners, you dont slam or talk about people who help you, you thank them and hope you continue with what you were given. Robert and his team gave of themselves to help others and that in itself is a wonderful blessing. That resturant was in a shambles when they got there and the owner admitted it along with his wife. Be KIND to those who help. Robert you and your team did a wonderful job, just remember as I am sure you do, PLENTY of people appreciate your kindness and will be forever grateful to you and your team. Love ya
Chef Robert, my husband and I watched the show last night and was disgusted by the restaurant and owners disregard for health and cleanliness. My husband has read a few blogs and some of the things the "now ungrateful owners" are saying about you and the Food Network. During the show we agreed we would never go to a restaurant like that even after the re-opening. You changed the restaurant, but the owners didnt change (their ways). Truly wish them the best. There business ethic and moral is non-existent, this shows even more with their threat to sue and placing blame on the network for staging.
Chef, wrote down your potato pancake receipe, better than the one I have used, my potatoes always turned brown, now we have those full size with applesauce for dinner looking to try the new one
Initial feeling, after seeing the location was, "Oh, chef was in Delaware, close to home and I missed the opportunity to meet him. Damn It!" After seeing the promo I wanted to flee the state. The shame of it all... that Delawarian is a Delaweenie!
I wish you could help a friend with her restaurant and if I had the money I would gladly pay for it. The food is great only when she is there to cook. Food and service collapse when she leaves. The last 4 meals I had ordered for take-out were so bad I couldn't cut with a knife (salmon patties was one). I was honest but I'm the bad guy now. How can one help a friend whose restaurant is folding due to customer fall-off. She is re-inventing her restaurant every 2 weeks which all so confusing to her (past) customer base who isn't speaking up.
Good morning, Chef! My wife and I watched the latest episode of RI last Wednesday night. I'm very impressed how you handled that horrible situation. I'm sure that a few of us joined with you in vomiting. I can't imagine if there is any further episode that is much worse than that episode. Keep it up!
How is Whisky doing?
So who are you pulling for in the super bowl??? 
I'm glad I'm able to TiVo Resturant Impossible! I just watched the episode on Rascals. OMG I couldn't believe you were able to get it turned around in two days, but it saddens me to know that Steve didn't follow through.
Hi chef, great show. you and design team did great work but i doudt the owner will keep things up. saw some posts from neighbors of rascal and they confirmed everything you said about the place. great job and tanya also
Just a quick question Chef, with all the new shows and things you have been doing, does this mean Dinner Impossible wont be returning? I really liked that show and hoped to see it again.
Hi Chef Robert! I'm glad to hear you are doing well and get to enjoy the day off tomorrow. Thanks for always reminding people to help others, I try to do something small to help a stranger whenever I can, and it came back to me today when someone let me know that the money I stuffed in my pocket for a quick grocery store run was about to fall out. I was so thankful they told me before I lost my money! This week will be pretty relaxed for me since I don't have any tests or papers due, so I think I'm going to try the turkey breast you made on Worst Cooks and also eggplant parmesan for my first time ever! I can't wait to try them!
This is my experience with Restaurant Impossible... I think it is the episode coming up...Chef came into Wilmington to a well known place that was dying a slow and painful death. He was greeted by the owners and all involved(I even know the banker) as a welcome site. He made the restaurant alive again, changed the menu, updated everything and I was there opening night! After a wonderful meal, I sat with Chef, shared a few drinks, and watched happy customers come and go. What they do with The Salt Works after that is up to the guys who own it. Chef Robert was fun, professional and generous-although I am sure he was tough on the owners and staff, too! I hope he continues to help those who need it, and we can all ignore the people who cannot appreciate something done for them... ok, I just needed to say that!
Hi Chef! So glad you do all you do, and that it appears you are on the mend. I've been dealing with this "cold" for 3 weeks - it just doesn't want to give up! A quick question - best cut of meat for chicken fried steak? I used to buy what they packaged as "breakfast steaks", but they are no longer selling those. I don't mind the tenderizing but I tried a thin cut round steak last time and no matter how long I beat them with the mallet they were still tough! Thanks in advance - and hope you kick this rotten bug!
Chef did that guys resturant really close down again? cause all the build up of trash at crabbies?
hello robert i heard you were sick i hope you are feeling better .great show weds night i missed sum but i heard the restaurant looked great.hope you are haveing a great weekend 
You're the man, Chef, Restaurant Impossible is a great show, just like Dinner Impossible which I hope will be back soon. Stuff happens, you can't make everyone happy, usually when you try, you lose. 
Chef - I love Restaurant Impossible not just because it's an enjoyable show and I love that you are helping families stay in business. But because it's one of the few shows my 19 year old son will watch with me. He enjoys it and I'm able to use the show as a learning tool - business, marketing, respect, health & hygiene, etc. without it being lectured to him!!! So keep up the good work! 
Just had to stop and say how much I enjoy the new show. Keep up the good work! 
Hope you feel better today ,Chef......we need you and all your motivational words!! 
Having fun exploring with the recipes from your books, made a rice dish and Dave actually loved it and had seconds! Unheard of, he hates rice, hahaha! Today Cas is cooking us dinner, and using proscuitto for something, we finally found some in a deli here :)
Good morning Chef!!!!!! So glad your feeling better.... (Raises Coffee Cup) Hope you have an AWESOME DAY!!!! 
My son Andrew (10) loves R.I. - and has been talking about becoming a chef after seeing just two episodes. He has dairy allergies and always loves to find recipes that he can create and eat. After reading the recent Rascals controversy, all I can say is that I was compelled to come to your page and become a fan...partly by my son being very adamant, but more importantly, that you are there to help and guide these owners to do a better job of respecting the cleanliness, quality, and consistency that the food service business demands....keep it up. If this is actually you Robert, personally, thanks for making Andrew as militant as you! 
Good morning Chef, so sorry to hear you are under the weather. There is a nasty bug going around. Hope you feel better soon! Have a great Sunday. Oh and I did try the creamed peas, but changed it up a bit, used drippings from pacetta instead of butter and added some pancetta bits along with a pinch of both onion and garlic powder. Only problem was the sauce was to think and i didn't know how to thin it out. But tasted great! 
Anyone having a Suberbowl Party? If so..whatcha's making? Me....Buffalo Wings with Ranch Dressing and celery on side..bar B Q drumsticks...Nachos..brownies...Chips..Soda and of course BEER!!!!! GO STEELERS!!!!!
Chef, Steelers or Packers? :)
Hi Chef, I am Blane's wife. Just want to know that I Love Love both the new shows Worst Cooks in America and Restaurant Impossible. I have been watcing you when you did Dinner Impossible. Keep up the great work. Hope to meet you sometime. Blane talks highly of you.

Since I'm not a big fan of Football, I shall have no problem watchin 'Worst Cooks In America' tonight at 10 p.m. With that said, I think I could probably be on that show if I wasn't so gosh-darn good at makin scrambled eggs! lol ;P
Everyone enjoy the game and stay warm, Chef, hope you are feeling better, fevers like that are nothing to mess with, they really knock a one two punch stay well
Have rto say, read Mission:Cook cover to cover....and that is the BEST recipe for oatmeal cookie EVER!
I know it took me way too long to post this but my surgery (27 Jan) went well except there was more to repair than initially expected....I am in a soft cast & hope to be transfered to a hard one when I see my surgeon tomorrow morning.....unfortunately, I also have some sad news.....Sweet Pea, my beloved Yorkie of 14 1/2 years, was diagonosed with kidney failure the day after my surgery. She passed away the next morning....I was devistated as she was my friend & companion for so long. She was cremated & placed in a beautiful Blaire Cedar Chest & is now home with her family. God Speed Sweet Pea, Mommie will always love you! :'(
Happy Sunday, Chef. Thanks for having a great show to watch instead of watching some silly football game! I'm a huge sports fanatic (go Spurs go), but I, admittedly, loathe football! Looking forward to "Worst Cooks" tonight! Cheers!
this game seems so long, and its 30 minutes to worst cooks will the game be over, who cares
Chef Robert...Just looked in on your profile on FoodTV and got a gander at your Bio Pic. Oh...Wow!!
Oh no!!! 4 cups of chicken broth instead of 4 tblsp. It is very intense in that studio and everybody gets nervous.
Ok, Cat having to clean her calamari and seeing her reaction to the sardine inside was priceless. Lol
Hey Everyone! Robert's episode(s) of "Chopped" begins 6 March! Started seeing the promos today!
Chef, great show yet again. question for the expert: why salt? all i see and hear is salt everything. I hate salt and will not cook or bake with it. is there a sub. for it that gives the same effect when tasted? i do cook with other spices just wondering. thanks!
great show, sorry to see Ty go, but it wasnt his time. Go Kelsey wow she has come a long way and Carlos, these are the two to watch, but things could change, I would never want to do that with fish, I buy mine fresh cut thats the only way for me, I'll do the rest. Have a great evening and a wonderful week
I just posted a comment about how much I was going to miss Ty. But then I deleted it because I didn't want to spoil it for anyone who reads your wall, but they haven't 'seen' the latest episode yet. But right after I deleted it, I read someone else's post saying pretty much the same thing. So hey? I'm back. o.O (lol) 
I also work in the Delaware Homeless Shelter twice a week, since 1994. I try, best that I can, to be a good Father to my two young Boys, and time also with my understanding Wife. Since my Mothers passing, my Father has not been well. Over the last eight months thing have gotten worse. I refuse to put him in a nursing home. I personally do not like the care given by most. He has a visiting nurse, Jennifer, come by for an hour a day. I take care of him, Breakfast, and dinner, everyday. I do this because I respect, and love him for all that he has done as a Father, and loving Husband to my Mother. I am moving him in with our Family as of next Friday so that I may keep a closer eye on him. MESSAGE CONTINUED BELOW.........................................................................
I bought Rascals from my parents nine years ago. My parents were from Greece originally. They came here, as children, dirt poor. They work their fingers to the bone to provide their Family with what they could. My Mother passed away a few years after I bought Rascals. Her passion was to help, and give all that she could to Saint Judes Children's Hospital. Since her passing, I followed by giving 10% of Rascals income to Saint Judes. I am proud to have done this, and love visiting the children over the years. MESSAGE IS CONTINUED BELOW............................................................................
hello chef hope your monday is goin well.glad you are feeling better
So HAD to share this funny story with you guys..on the way home from school today, my 3 year old starts singing "3 blind mice" then goes into "3 DEAD mice, 3 Dead mice" so I asked her where she learned it and she said "Chef Robert"! I was laughing so hard I almost had to pull over! Then she said, "Momma, can't you see him? He is right here on my head" so now, Chef Robert, you are part of my daughters imaginary friend group! Just had to share! 
Hi chef robert Hope DI comes back . Been watching it on cable demand . I think worst cooks show is great , also RI . Hope you are feeling better take . carol
ok..dont believe its really you..but DAMN YOU ARE SEXY AS HELL! ID WATCH YOU DARN SOCKS TO CHECK OUT THOSE PIPES! JUST SAYIN' HEHE
OK..I JUST WENT AND TRIED TO JOIN ALL THE OTHER SITES FOR CHEF SEXY AND NOT ALLOWED TO SAY ANYTHING ON THEM! IM A CHEST AND ARM WOMAN AND I FOUND YOU! I HIT PAY DIRT BABY! LOVE YOU..
Hello, Chef. Last night on Worst Cooks, your recruits made pan seared sea bass and I notice you left the skin on. When you plate the cooked fish, do you remove the skin? If not, are you supposed to eat the skin or leave it on the plate? I feel like I should know the answer to this already but we both know that I am not a lover of fish, so I'm puzzled. Hope you had a good day today! 
Okay, I snagged your email address. Do we just email you our home address and that's it? Can it really be that easy? no way! O.o
Hey Chef! I hope all is well with you these days. I've just uploaded a few photos to my wall of a flock of American Bald Eagles you should check out. And if you have the time, scroll down to this past Saturday. You will find several great photos of an Albino Moose that were taken in Western Canada here. Take the time Robert to see them.
To Chef Irvine and all those who visit this page today - Have an AWESOME day and remember to share your smile! BE Well my friends!!!
Hello Chef Robert, just wanted to tell you how much we love your shows!! Watching you has even inspired my 10 year old son, he now wants to be a chef! We have really enjoyed you on Worst Cooks, and we saw the promo for Chopped with all the FNW chefs, my son said Chef Robert can beat them all:)
So last night around 9, I put together my snack of chips and salsa and settled on the couch to watch Restaurant Impossible. How did I go all day thinking it was Wendesday yesterday? LOL
Chef Robert. Just wanted to let you know that we think you're great. My girls now want to cook dinner every night and they always sit down to watch your shows with me. Nice bonding time. Thanks.
Chef, having a TERRIBLE day, incident with my son at school and spending my time on FB venting to my friends. Thanks for making me smile and forget about it for a minute or two! you are the BEST!!see, I'm the one of the ones you helped today! 
Hi Chef!! Just have to tell you that my six year old LOVES watching you. He has always said he wanted to be a chef/caterer like me, but that has now changed to being a chef like you! He loves Worst Cooks and Dinner:Impossible. Thanks for inspiring him!!
For some reason I couldn't tag you, Chef..here's what I posted on my wall. Hope it's OK! "Please watch my buddy Chef Robert Irvine on tonight's All new Restaurant: Impossible Tonight at 10pm on Food Network Robert heads to Salt Works II in Wilmington, N.C.! If you enjoy Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares, you'll love Robert's take on it!" 
Robert, we've had this date on the calendar for weeks. Good luck. 
just wanted to say my husband and I cant wait to watch you on the "Chopped-All Stars".
Chef, do you have any update on Rascals? Watched that last night and all I can say is UNBELIEVABLE!
anyone can answer this for me because I have a recipe calling for cooked. For the potato pancakes are the potatoes cooked or not this is from the show
hello chef robert i just finished watching sun winefest 2011 and i loved the vidoes wished i was there you look awesome and keep up with the good work you rock robert

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!! I think this had to be my favorite episode so far!!!! I think Hubby and I may have go on a road trip!!! i have family down in NC...go visit them and check out Salt Works II....Now there'sa plan :)
Great show, Chef! You did a terrific job & we'll have to stop in on the way down to visit my dad. You are such a kind & caring person :) Go Team Blue!!!
Excellent show tonite Chef Robert, 5 stars. You make it seem so easy and these owners and their workers wanted to learn. Glad to see Vanessa Deleon back. Wish Salt Works ll good luck, if they listen to you, they will suceed. Till next week.
You made me so hungry when you made the sausage gravy and you make cooking look so easy. The food on the new menu looked incredible. If they follow your suggestions and guidelines they will continue their success and reap the rewards. Cannot wait until the next episode.
Great RI episode Robert! Fried green tomatoes and feta cheese -- 2 of my favorites, but never would have thought of putting them together. Seemed like a great crew at Salt Works II -- everyone on that team really wanted to succeed.
Love your shows! Great episode at Salt Works II. Keep it up!
Loved the show tonight. Wonderful things to come for the most deserving young people. Thanks for all you did for Saltworks. 
Hey Chef, I searched for the cream sauce recipe from the sausage episode of Worst Cooks, but couldn't find it, did it have a more specific name than 'cream sauce'? I'm excited to cook it when my hubby is home from deployment!
My neighbor and sweet friend is one of the owners of Saltworks II. We had a great party at the restaurant tonight and the staff and owners are on a high after the show! Thanks for all you and your staff did! It's a special place and those guys are working hard to keep it!
I *just* saw the ad for Chopped All-Stars... omgosh I can't WAIT :D woohoo!
Love love ur shows... both the wrost cook in america and restaurant impossible... but the girl that didt knew? the fried green tomatoes??? 4 me its the easiest among all items in the mune... on 2nights show... 
what is a fried green tomato? grits? never had them.. hush puppy? huh? never had any of them..are these Ma. foods or strickly southern foods? lol
Chef, just wondering...uhhhhhhhhh...do you feel loved or stalked?
Loved last nights show. Vanessa is amazing and did a wonderful job in the time constrants. You are forceful yet encouraging. Just found out one of the producers is an Arcadai alumni.
Was she able to answer about the Fried GreenTomato and was she able to get her shirt???
I just wanted to say that Your an awesome Chef. I love Worst Cooks & RI, I was wondering if You were going to do anymore of DI hope You do love all that You do Chef Have a blessed day.
Has anybody seen Irvine's recipe for sausage gravy anywhere? My family loves it and I would like to try that recipe!
Just watched the RI episode with my family and we loved it! It was so nice to see the owners stepping up to the plate! I wish them loads of luck~! You should be proud of your self, you really are changing lives!! Great Job Chef! 
Just thinking after warching that RI last night, would it be better to open your Bistro here in Bluffton so that the students at USCB can enjoy your restaurant? That would be a good way of advertising it to the students there since that campus is growing. I bet some students would even want to work in your Bistro. What do you think?
RI was awesome last night! Throughout the episode, the owners didn't really strike me as very emotional guys, so when they both started tearing up at seeing the renovations, it was such a great moment! You did good Chef, you did good. :)
i just looked at a couple of other chefs pages on fb and none had the communication with their fans the way Chef Robert has..we are loyal and he loyaL to us! thank you Chef Robert! YOU ROCK!
I LOVE LOVE LOVED the RI show Chef!! What you did was amazing, you literally saved these guys skins! I think it's awesome all the support you have to help others, and it amazing that you use the talent you've been blessed with to help others! Hats off to you!
i have a very important question but not pertaining to cooking. you obviously workout, so i have a bench pressing question. right now i bench about 70 lbs. i am 5'2 female and by april i need to be able to bench about 110lbs.is pyramid( light 15reps, heavier 8 reps, heaviest 5 reps, repeat) lifting better than standard? or is there a different way. i sent you an email but i guess it must have gone to the wrong person on facebook. if you wish, you can personally reply to my facebook site. thank you.a huge fan of yours...lisa 
jamie...whats the diff between palmetto and hilton head? just curious..
hey chef robert remember me you said that i made the best franchaise and marsala sauce in the whole city(in your cute accent) itz me barbara from caesars atlantic city.i like to thankyou for putting me in the gourmet rooms luv all your shows and i see that you are keepin your physique lol hope to see you soon if i become chopped champion.i am very proud to tell people i have worked wit you not bcause of your fame bcause of your talent luv ya!!!
I'm coming to dinner tomorrow night.... Just a heads up so you can RUN! lol
Question for Chef Robert or anybody else that might have the answer.....question: When making Pate a Choux do you need to use a stick of butter or can you use a stick of margarine? I'd like to make some but I have margarine in my refrigerator.
hello robert how you doin today.i put some videos on your page the one you at sun wine fest hope you dont mind i thought i share with everyone incase no one saw them
Hi Chef, Just wanted to stop by and tell you that my 9 y/o daughter and I enjoy watching your RI Show. She says that you are alot nicer than Ramsey and cuter too. :) We run our own restaurant in Knox, IN. She wanted to ask you how come the health inspector hadn't shut that restaurant down (last weeks episode). I told her that I didn't know, so I told her to ask you :) Please keep up the good work! Have a great weekend!
Just wanted to say one of the items I served at our neighbor's Superbowl party was your mini venison burgers..thanks for the tasty recipe! Looking forward to getting more people hooked on RI...our family loves it! Blessings to you for what you do..
hey chef just want to say good night sweet dreams xoxo
Hot date with the Huz. Early Valentine's celebration. He wont be home on monday - traveling for work. A nice dinner out, then who knows!
Hey just wondering? what are u doing on vday? mean other than work. I know that ur busy between shows & other stuff. u have a nice day Robert a.k.a. handsome =)
Hi Chef! I have a question for you (or if anybody else knows the answer to this, feel free to pipe in!) Doing a big dinner for church, and the dessert is some lovely brownies we purchased that are sinfully delicious. I wanted to doll the plates up a bit with a pool of white chocolate creme anglaise, but not sure I will have the time to do that on Monday. I've heard you can take high quality ice cream, allow it to melt at room temp, and use it in place of anglaise, is this true? Thanks for the help!
Hows ur day handsome? anyways just getting some stuff done.... b4 girls night.... u have a good afternoon...
Question for Chef Robert or anybody else who might know the answer. Question: If tequila is poured into another bottle how long will it stay drinkable?
morning chef. thanks again for the info on the lifting. have you ever heard of " grey poupon mustard roast" recipie or " beef roll up"?they r southern oldies but goodies. mustard roast is made with a rump roast and other is made with thin sliced steak or cubed steak, bacon and thin sliced sweet gerkin with awesome sauce. not 5 star but home cooking. would love to send you recipie and tell me what you think if u havent tried them yet. let me know ..lisa
You are going to be a huge part of my Valentine's Day! I'll be making a very fancy, champagne-themed dinner, and most of the recipes are yours: champagne-brie fondue, champagne peach and mint soup, salad w/ mascarpone-chive dumplings & candied walnuts in champagne vinaigrette, chicken Champagne (which is the only recipe that isn't yours), asparagus, and your chocolate mousse (with a touch of champagne in the whipped cream). I hope you approve! It will be just like you are here cooking, only much worse (LOL). I don't claim to have your talent, but I'll do my best to honor your fabulous ideas and your clear instructions. Have a happy Valentine's Day!
I am looking for information on a ingredient. I have been duplicating dishes out of 1880 Cook book and before 1880 cook bookes. I have ran across a ingredient that I cannot find or get information about. It is called table sauce. It is not salt because that is called for. I do not think it is vinager. There is a good bit of table sauce put in some of these dishes before you cook it. I am cook these dishes to get a better understanding and for the love of food. 
Chef, I've just become acquainted with your work, and love the show, "Restaurant Impossible". Your food looks wonderful; do you have a website with recipes?
Hi Chef Robert... I just wanted to let you know that I saw Ty, the recruit from the Worst Cooks in America (this seasons)... on the GSN channel on the Newly Wed Show. I don't know what year it was that he was on but, I knew it was Ty! How cool is that? Have a very Happy Valentine's Day! :-) 
Looking forward to Worst Cooks. Have a gteat Valentins Day!

Just love all of your shows!!!!
Happy Valentine's Day! hope u have a good one! mine would be grate if u want my valentine. kiss
Would you consider changing your profile pic to the blue shirt, arm flex, wire whisk, GB belt buckle photo? 
Robert, I just started watching your Restaurant Impossible Series. My husband & I love it! We really enjoyed your Dinner Impossible shows (and I wrote letters to FoodNetwork MANY times when Guy was doing *your* show... We wanted you! We were thrilled you came back to that series too) but your RI shows are even better because it showcases how brilliant of a chef, businessman and KIND person you are. I hope you do a second season!!!! xx
Chef -- I really think you picked the the wrong people for Worst Chefs -- I just hope she proofs you correct. I loved Kelsey!
Oh, come on Chef, you know you just picked her because you have a thing for cooks named George!! haha
I like Dinner Impossible but really enjoy Restaurant Impossible ......so glad you survived the crappy crab shack.....that was a disgusting mess when you started. Keep it up You are truly inspiring 
Robert... Sexiest man in the universe...Will you be my Valentine??? <3 <3 <3 Nikki

Happy Valentines Day Chef ! I Pray that it is filled with love and many blessings ! Toasting you with some bubbly tonight !!! 
Happy Valentine's Day Chef! <3
Hey Chef, my friend! At the library and visited you! Had a wonderful time guessing (correctly) who was going to represent you next week on Worst Cooks! You once again have inspired your team to keep going and become better cooks! Enjoy your day! 
HI Chef....you posted on twitter the following: "Why can't people get on with each other, and treat each other with dignity and respect ! Annoys me when one person makes another sad" I'd like to know the answer to that myself, however I know one of those types of person and unfortunately my brother is one of those people. Since he has hurt me so much all I can try and do is pray and hope for the best for him. It will be a tough thing to do but I have to try.
May you find Peace, Comfort and Love on this Valentine's Day and beyond......... Random Acts of Kindness are like ripples in the Caring and Sharing Sea which one day may culminate in a Tidal Wave of Change, if we never give up. I, for one, will NEVER GIVE UP!!!!!! ! ! ! ! ! ! Happy Valentines Day ! ! ! ! !!

Happy Valentine's day to Chef and family. You're always in our thoughts and prayers. Love, your girls :)
Latest update....my surgeon fitted me for an 'air-cast'...not too bad since it can be removed when needed...hopefully the sutures will be removed 21 February, my next appointment...he said, so far things look good....I was a little surprised, though, as to the number of incisions & their length....2 @ about 4" on outside of ankle & top of foot plus an extention & 2 smaller ones top of ankle...here's the good part....no weight on foot untill he says so....crutches are quite the adventure....aybe I should practice my hopping! Happy Valentine's Day Robert (a little late)! Hugs! xo <3
I made Chateaubriand w/bearnaise sauce and fresh roasted asparagus for my hubby last night. Dessert was a chocolate pate w/strawberry coulis. He bought the flowers, the champagne and lit the fireplace! Very sweet and special. 
i know iam late but happy valentines day chef hope had a great one 
Hi Chef! Just wanted to let you know that the Valentine's Bash at church was a big success. It was quite a rush, I could get used to cooking for large amounts of people like that, it's a great feeling! I had a "dinner impossible" moment when at 5:50 I was still breading up chicken to fry. I thought there is NO way I'm going to have all this ready to serve by 7:00. But my crew was awesome, and we pulled thru! 
This might be kind of random, Chef...I've been using your recipe to make clafoutis out the wazoo this month (I've used blueberries, raspberries, even pineapple and mango!); clafoutis is(are?) my new favorite thing to make! And the family goes crazy for it(them?) ^_^ In any case, I want to continue to experiment and use pears and apples this time around. So, while I'm experimenting, I thought I might try honey instead of the sugar. So might you have a suggestions for substituting honey for sugar in your recipe for clafoutis?
I saw pasta made by mixing the wet and dry with roasted red pepper then using a china cap to drop into water.. what is that kind of pasta called??
is it just me or are all the times and dates messed up on this site
why is it iam 'not allowed' to comment on others pages when i see everyone else doing it..i have to post a separate message and then no one ever gets it anyways..frustrating
Hello chef how are you doing.i hope you had a good valentines day
Digging on the Hilton Head Celebrity Golf Tournament Fleece you're sporting on Restaurant Impossible Chef! Good looking out for our home town! :-) 
Just wondering, has anybody been to any of the restaurants that have been made over recently? 
Great Show tonight, hope all is still going good with restaurant. Great job again Team Robert
I went to Meglio's for the grand re-opening, so I couldn't wait for tonight's R:I, to see what the restaurant was like before its transformation. I can testify what it was like after Chef worked his magic. The whole experience just took my breath away! My filet mignon w/ herb butter & cucumber tapenade on polenta was probably the best thing I've ever eaten. My daughter is still talking about her tomato-basil soup. Now that I see how much labor went into the fried ravioli, I almost feel guilty that we ordered some, but we did, and they were perfect. The ambiance was beautiful and inviting and all of the employees were friendly and efficient. The new Meglio's was awesome, all thanks to the vision and determination of one great man, and the hard work of many who followed his lead.
Watching Restaurant Impossible! Watching him makes my heart race!! Besides the fact that he's the sexiest man alive... he's really changing lives... A knight in shining armor! MY HERO!!! <3 <3 <3 Niks
WOW..5000 PLUS FANS ON HERE! TO BE SO LOVED BY SO MANY..MUST BE A WONDERFUL FEELING! LOVE IT!
i bring page up and it has Chef's comment from Tuesday on first..scroll down and you start to get recent posts? im lost? i dont know when or where to respond..i dont know where it will end up..he has posted since Tuesday??? anybody seeing this..or is it just me??? thanks...
love what u have done 2 meglio's... there place looks much better than b4... sometimes the truth hurts, more than anything else.... there are times that u must say.... in front of a crowed, makes it an eye opening 2 what? they have done wrong... then the end result... priceless.... 
Wow! Look at Robert's fan page count go up... Is everyone telling their friends to "like" his page? 
Hi Chef! Love your shows and your no nonsense approach. Wish I could open my own puerto rican food restaurant, (I have my grandma's recipes ;o)). I would also like to learn how to make healthy food that is not so expensive and my kids can like. The economy has hit us hard. The other day I tried chicken bourbon and I got my throat irritated with the red pepper so now I am sick. I am usually a good cook, but the recipe I got was not so clear in the order of the ingredients, etc. I'm also not a fan of heat in food because for me it disguises the flavor of it. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. Blessings! And please go back to Puerto Rico, our food needs more exposure, it is trully incredible! ;o)
Homemade bread and shrimp and grits for dinner...yummmm!! whats everyone else making? 
Chef Robert, I have a question about your recent RI episode at Meglio's. Why was Best Buy's sign blurred which other stores weren't blurred. Just wondering. Many thanks!
I was just wondering if you did the voice over for the Meglio's Resturuant Impossible when you where sick because your voice sounded like your throat was really sore.
how do make clam chowder? since that ones u buy, are expensive and there are times that I have people over. espicaly my female friends, they love love love chowder. pls tell on how 2 made (clam chowder).
looking for more RI on demand saw a Ramsey show..i used to look for..now he drives me nuts..coming in in a helicoptor with Ramsey across it..so stupid..ill keep looking for a rerun of Chef Sexy!
Well the DInner Impossible site is being shut down, what a bummer, guess there was too much negative remarks but WHY I ask WHY, don't become a fan just to slam
Hey Chef, I think I'm going to make your Chicken Piccata!!!
Robert, All of us at the Secret Garden cannot begin to tell you what a great time we had and how much we appreciate everything you have helped us with. We all really enjoyed the episode tonight of Restaurant: Impossible and look forward to seeing you help other restauranteurs in the future...THANKS AGAIN, Mike and Zack.
I had no idea this surgey would kick me around as much as it has....sometimes my brain is so frazzled I can't get it around a thought...but I'm working on it....my son, Larry, turned 26 on 12 Feb & his birthday is on hold...yikes....he's cool with it, just tells me I can make it up to him with an ice cream cake...hahahahaha....I miss all of you here & know I'm working on coming back, it's just taking me longer than I expected.
Life is too short to worry about what others say or think about you. So have fun and give them something to talk about. I'm proud of my heart. It's been played, stabbed, cheated, burned and broken, but somehow still works.
Chopped All Stars is going to be great, can't wait for it although i am going to have to let my daughter us the tv all day just so i can watch it though :( LOL
Oh where oh where did our Chef Robert Go, we miss him so much, so please stop by and say hello, just missing you hope all is well 
3 hours and 15 minutes.....exciting!
looking forward to tonights show.watching reruns forbthe build up! very exciting! miss hearing fromyou..you have us all spoiled! be safe
Hi Robert! We sure do miss ya here! Come back when you can, but we know you are super busy. Love ya! (oh, and one hour til WCIA finale!)
my 3 year old is sitting in front of the tv saying she can't wait to see Chef Robert and singing Three Dead Mice! oh boy!
well two minutes left! not long walked in the door! gulp who ya routing for
I'm loving the finale of Worst Cooks, hope you and Georg win!! Hope you also have a great week Chef, I have my nursing school interview on Wednesday so I'm really nervous/excited!
lmao, I found myself talking to the tv when ann yell's at you to get off the line. protective of you telling her to relax he's just watching over her ann. 
WHAT! NO! THE JUDGES ARE NUTS! 
Ok, let's see Chef Anne take ONLY $10,000 and turn a restaurant around in JUST 2 DAYS!!!!
Chef, You are just one amazing individual!!! Loved the finale!!
YOU WERE RIGHT THAT YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE POTATOE CAKE WHEN GEORG WAS FILLING THE SKILLET TOO MUCH. HAS SHE NOT DONE THAT, I AM SURE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WINNER. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU TO BE ABLE TO TURN ONE OF THE WORST COOK INTO AN EXCELLENT COOK. I AM GOING TO LOOK FOR YOUR RECIPE ON THIS SHOW AND MAKE IT MYSELF. BRAVO CHEF!!!!
I just got a twitter account i was wondering if you have one so i can follow you if you do.
Looking forward on Wed. for RI and also for the Chopped All Stars in March. Tonight was reall exciting!!! Thanks for the ENTERTAINMENT, ALL THE GOOD RECIPES AND TIPS ON HOW TO COOK THEM. My heart was raising, when you can not even tell Georg not to put too much potatoe. Well, it is the best show, until the next one.
Chef! Love you as a blonde. I think Georg was robbed. I absolutely adore her and wish the blue team would have won!! Congrats on a fun and eventful second season of WCIA!!
Chef Robert, if a person has an idea for a unique small scale restraunt/cafe. When I say unnique, it would be unique for the area where I live. How does one create a business plan to present to others?
24 minutes and I am another year older
I just can't believe josh won.. He should have been elminated a long time ago.. He was all over the place with his crazy self.. U & Georg should have won sweet Robert.. U look so cute as a blonde lol.... Have a blessed & wonderful night Robert.. Sweet dreams Robert..
Fun to watch Worst Cooks last night! Smart of you to pick dishes that would highlight Georg's knife skills, something that I'm sure the professional chefs/judges didn't expect! Sorry that she didn't win...potato cakes are a challenge for the best! Now looking forward to R:I and Chopped!
I have to say that you are a lot i MEAN A LOT sexy'er as a Burnett. Blond is not you. I really was pulling for ya. Can't wait to see you on Chopped. I hope you go up against Chef Ann and WIN
The wait for Chopped is slowly killing me! Haha..
Chef Robert - really enjoying RI, hope to see many more episodes. I travel a lot as a consultant, and ironically during my travels I happened to eat at both Secret Garden and Vallari's recently. The staff at both locations just had great things to say about you. They said it was a crazy experience but they really enjoyed working with you. Oh, and the food and service were great. Awesome job.
Good afternoon everyone hope you all enjoyed the worst cooks finale! well getting ready to go back to NY and film the view on wednesday morning which will air on friday morning, then on to Miami! food and wine
Hello Robert how are ya today? Hope all is well with u today.. What are u doin today? I made a peanut butter & choclate pie.. 
Good luck on the View, I am sure if I was on that panel, that close to you, I would loose all ability to form complete sentences.....or words for that matter! Stopped watching that show a long time ago, but will tune in for you and of course spread the word. Just gotta let my mom know and she will be all over it.....think she has phone chain going on for your shows. And you as a blonde....I think Anne and Guy can pull it off. You....sorry to say....not so much.....but hey still love you~
Great news Robert...I saw my surgeon this AM...he removed all the sutures, I can put pressure on the heel of my foot to walk...he said everything looks good....I start PT next week & the best part is I can take a bath in a few days...with bubbles involved....no more of this spongy stuff! Yea! I go back in 2 weeks! BTW....really love the RI & Worst Cooks...they were great! Love you! Hugs! xo
thank u for an incredible experience, even though i was on the other side it didnt matter, u were warm, engaging and just so personable throughout boot camp, u were never a spoiled superstar chef and always hung out between segments and chatted with all of us, i have nothing but admiration for u and hope to bump into ya in the future, cheers
I wish I had some of Robert's caramell brie...
Thank you Chef Robert for the experience of a lifetime. You are a tough-love kinda guy with a heart of GOLD...and for whom I have the utmost respect and admiration. Thanks for believing in me and pushing me to the MAXimum limits. This experience has changed my life forever... just as you said it would when we initially met you. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Til' the next time :) ... lady georg

Any chance you can post the lamb and potato cake recipes that was in Worst Cooks - that looked SOOOO good!
Just curious...is this actually Chef Irvine or a fan page? 
Have fun at the Food Network South Beach Wine & Food Festival !

Stay:Happy, Healthy, and well always Chef Irvine!!! Sincerely Shawnda (Miller Littleton,Colorado)
Chef Robert, Do you know if I have to use a copper bowl when making chocolate truffles? I have heard that, but I'm not sure what the benefits are for using copper vs. stainless steel or glass. HELP!!!
hey Chef Robert, i hope the ladies on the veiw treated you well, and that you had a safe and good trip to Florida, enjoy the warm weather i wish i could be in your back pocket, as the weather in good old South Dakota is freezing and just unbearable!
Hi Chef finally got to catch Restaurant Impossible. Ten minutes into it and love it.
Michael and Sach, YOU ARE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE ROBERT HELP YOU IN RE-MAKING YOUR RESTAURANT!!! That was a good idea Chef, a gourmet buffet. Bluffton can use one of those. I really love the decor, and it all started from you poking a big hole on the wall. What a genius idea. My heart was raising watching this show. It was well done Chef!! Where is the next one?
Good Evening Chef. Just finished watching RI. When you get home from filming these shows, do you go see your doctor to check your blood pressure? Mine would be sky high. Lol. Great show and glad these 2 guys are pleased with your assistance. Did you survive the Ladies of The View today?
I'm curious. What's been the biggest lessons YOU'VE learned about overhauling a restaurant in such short time? I noticed how shaking things seemed to be with the designers in the first episode (the chair fiasco), and also the repeated use of carpet tile after it was first introduced. But that's just learned info, not real lessons. Has how the first few places went over affected your "plan of attack" for later places? Keep being awesome!
well had an amazing time at the view with whoopie and Sherri made some awesome food and then ran out to the airport to miami ! just landed here
Just wanted to tell ya Chef - Watching the commercials tonight on FN - I cannot WAIT til CHOPPED ALL STARS starts! Watching you and Chef Anne duke it out on your own turf - looks absolutely awesome!! I know you won't disappoint! Have you been tapped to do the next season of Worst Cooks? Man I hope so!!! Thanks for everything!
Hi, Chef! I saw a replay of the season finale of Worst Chefs tonight and was wondering: what would Chef Anne have had to do if your recruit had won?
 great Chef, i am so glad you had a good time, your right food does soften you up, so does good down home comfort food, thank the lord my teacher, my Mom taught me how.
where can I find your public appearance schedule? My 11 year old daughter is your biggest fan and we would love to coem see you!!!
Chef Robert - It was a pleasure meeting you at Miami Airport last night. See you at SOBEWFF!
Good Morning Robert.I got a question do you know if there is going to be a wine fest in aug and if there is do you know who is doing it
Hi Chef! When does the View eppie air?

Hope you guys can come out and dine with us sometime in the future. Jerzey boy Lee has no excuses! Have a LARGE day, Tom and Jeff
Chef, you have inspired me to become a better cook. I am going to dive into recipes and not be afraid. Tonight I made beef stroganoff and it turned out fantastic! Thanks for the inspiration and confidence!
Chef, I am a Marine helicopter pilot that just returned from Afghanistan. Prior to leaving, my wife and I went to see you cook at Food and Wine Festival in the California Adventure Park. Unfortunately, we were unable to actually meet you. She posted on your page before I left for Afghanistan and you responded, which made her day. Thank you for your kind words to her. It meant a lot to me. I grew up in South Carolina and spent my summers at Hilton Head with my family. I just heard from my aunt that my family is planning to spend a week there this summer. This will be the first time in 13 years that I've been back. I would really like to take my wife to Eat! while we are on the island. I'm hoping there would be a chance for her to meet you if you are planning to be at your restaurant during the summer. Do you have a schedule for when you will be at Eat!? Thanks again, Adam
Robert, I need to add that you are amazing. I closely watch, the different group of people you help, every week on the show. How you change their lives. The best part of the show is at the end to see the look on thier faces. YOU, and your team, are such an inspiration to the families you help, and to all of us.
Good Morning Chef, just watched the View! Classic...and great job, hope to be able to find the recipes. You always put a smile on our faces! 
well good morning everybody! just watched the view segment on ABC.com awesome and funny, well headed to work out now, then to the festival see ya there

OMG I loved the sledge hammer ( thats the way to do it ) --get-er-done-
Hello Chef! I love your shows. I wish Georg would have won on Worst Cooks. I'm not a fan of that Chef Ann lady. Her cooking show is dumb and I hate her hair. I love to cook, but I consume Way too much salt. But it adds flavor. I love pepper and jerk seasoning too. Any advice you would have for me, I would take to heart. I love making homemade chicken noodle soup, but I salt the stock a lot before I cook the chicken and veggies and I salt my flour/ eggs mixture before I roll out my pasta. Will you help me. Please. Cooking is in my soul and I love big, bold flavors. Thank you Chef and Take Care. 
Hello again Chef,hope all is well in your neck of the world.Anyways i was looking at your tweets on Twitter and noticed that you mentioned Joel Osteen, He is the one that my sweepea and i watch on t.v. on Sunday morning. He is very inspirational,and his words have hit home on more than one occaision for me or my sweepea. (His name just happens to be Robert as well.)How has Joel inspired you Chef? The words "He will take you to places youve never been before." help me through some really hectic times. Take care and stay:Happy,Healthy,and Blessed always Chef.Sincerely Shawnda Miller.

OK so here is the recipe I made for our 21st wedding anniversary. One day late but it all worked out. Let me just say that it was tasty but I don't think it is anything close to what Chef Robert Irvine's Recipe would look like. It is Chicken Fricassee or Chicken - Country Captain but Chef Alphonse Lucier said they were the same thing. I don't think I should have used canned tomatoes. The chicken itself was extremely tender (used boneless skinless breasts) and had lots of flavor. We topped ours with grated Parmesan Cheese. Oh well one day maybe Chef Irvine will knock on my front door and show how the recipe should have been made. AHHHH now there is an idea for a new show. I will make this again with some adjustments, like smaller julienne carrots.
okay gotta run for a hair cut ! before i get an important phone call! keep thinking how we can do this! back soon
OK i need a HUGE HUGE favor from you ALL!!! i need to make sure however we do it that the whole country knows about RESTAURANT IMPOSSIBLE and watches it tonight.... make it your goal to ask at least one person you know who never watches the show to watch it tonight please.... need more viewers .. there are No prices but i could use your help! thanks in advance xxx
Farmer markets provided the turnips, butter, rabbit and collard greens. Moving to healthy food is an incremental process and and whenever I can I limit myself to just what is from the market. I should have used local pecans instead of almonds. BTW, the boule I made myself.
Baked snapper with sauted spinach, carrots and green onions with mashed white turnips and watercress garnish.
Lots of the farmers I know are without internet access or time to do research. If you want to help, look at programs like the Value Added Producer's Grant possibilities for people like your local cheesemaker.
The rice was not from the local farmer market, but the chutney was. I realized that I have opened three cans this year, two of tomato paste and one of black beans and the last packet I opened contained yeast.
I just saw a video where a single farmer spent $million on spraying herbicides on his crops without getting rid of the resistant weeds. I can manage 3-5 acres a day with the right tools I am sure lots of farm workers would love to do the work at $50/acre.
One more thing..END bottled water sales before your profiteering is exposed..do the right thing...Buy Brita!

Did anyone else feel sad for Mitch in episode five? It just seemed like maybe he was out of his element, not one for really speaking up, had a super aggressive father in-law, and hadn't trained his cooks to, well, cook. :( It was sad to watch! How hard that must be, when you f-i-l talks to you that way, and you are trying to be the strong husband. So sad. :(

Winner of the Dish Favorite Recipe competition Alison, pictured here with friend Anne, joined the Dish team at a special event today at the Gagganau showroom. They flew from Canterbury to enjoy Alison's prize of a night at The Langham with dinner at Barolo and a shopping spree at Cook the Books and Farro Fresh.
And private chef Simon Chin prepared fabulous dishes - all reader's favorites including the winning dish - the delicious lamb tagine from issue 8 that Alison loves so much.
Dish Food Editor Claire Aldous was guest chef today at the Devonport Wine and Food Festival today. In a tent set amongst the pohutukawa trees and almost right on the edge of the sparkling water, Claire demonstrated a delicious variation of the zucchini, chicken and farro salad from the current issue - page 68.
The Dish team is relieved to report our Christchurch-based team members, columnist chef Jonny Schwass and wine writer Yvonne Lorkin and their families are safe and sound following the devastating quake in Christchurch on Tuesday. Our thoughts are with everyone in the Canterbury region at this dreadful time.
The Dish team are delighted you are loving the new issue. Keep the feedback coming. We are hard at work on the next one and it's looking good.

Hey I Support Farmers Markets ~ you gotta connect with Santa Barbara Farmers Market --they are great!!
I just wanted to say that i have always supported local shopping but now i have really gone on the up and up with it. i have finally started to buy local ONLY eggs and am looking for winter markets since up here in the north many shut down in winter. i plan to buy so much more at the markets, i hope others see the value and the FUN in farmers markets!!
Howdy small farm in NC here. Mostly eggs, a lil goat milk and a couple Zebu's! 
I live in a small town In Louisianna,surrounded by crawfish and rice fields. I wish I knew how to help the local community start a Farmers Market. Any suggestions?

Thanks from one of our slow food advocates for this link.... great carrot recipes in the post! Shared with Slow Food USA, Santa Barbara Farmers Market, Sonoma Valley Grapes and Wine
Many states are passing bills that will exempt small farms from paperwork and inspections in order to sell at farmers markets. We support this and feel that all local farmers should be left alone to sell at local markets... Market managers and consumers can figure this out.... what do you think?
Walkin the walk, talkin the talk.... farmers markets in California have been behind the ban on plastic bags for a while... organic and all...What about your market? Recycle bags are a great opportunity for advertising by farms.... are there plasttic or recycle bags at your market?
GMO do more than just effect the crops they come from..... this is a must read... and please DO comment and pass this along...:-)
Two posts today.... We are advocating farmers markets to understand Non-GMO labeling. Local Farmers can are using non-gmo as a very good MARKETING tool for consumer loyalty. NONgmo at ur markets? shared with Algoma Farmers' Market, Tipton City Farmers Market, Mass Farmers Markets, Seattle Farmers Markets, @[72217132966:274:North Carol
The local impact of farmers markets has become a substantial force in each city they are in. Not only are they supporting farmers that are nearby they keep those dollars nearby as farmers respend them. The best part? No one individual or company owns the safe local food farmers market effort.... How much do you spend at your market?
Whole Wheat Tomato-Basil Spaghetti. The freshest ingredients always make for the most delicious dishes. <3 <3 <3
Markets support farmers, some managers want to offer other items... what is happening in your area?
This is a slippery slope... FArmers markets have a real opportunity to promote the NO GMO label.... Europe is much stricter on GMOs and in face Walmart in Europe lables Organic and Non GMO but not here. Thoughts?

Wooops! Seems I have signed into an American Farmers' Market page....I am looking for the Canadian one, in British Columbia. Wishing you all success and I will keep searching.

wht's d cost of 500gb portable hard disk?? can v use it on any system configuration??? plz reply back..
I have a FreeAgent Go (320) I bought from the Seagate website a few years ago. It's almost full, mainly of photos and documents and I'm wanting to purchase another one. I saw there is a 2T GoFlex Desk but have read tons of horrible reviews. I am not concerned with daily back up of everything .. when I upload pictures from my camera I copy them onto my computer harddrive, then at the beginning of the following month I copy the previous month on the external drive. When we are away on vacation I remove the unit and put it in a firesafe. Can the GoFlex Desk be used this same way ??
Hey, newsflash, Seagate. Guys aren't the only ones who want digital storage for Valentine's day! Sheesh!
Deeply disappointed with Seagate's Sales people at Macworld Expo, in San Francisco last month. The sales person clearly didn't know how to use the online sales site that attendees such as me had to use to make a purchase. In the crowded, noisy expo booth, as she "guided" me through the steps to make a purchase with the events discount promo code, she suddenly realized she was having me type my info into a previous buyer's pages, including credit card info! She had to ask another sales person what to do next, then told me to proceed. I did, because I wanted the discount price, so I followed her lead. The result was that the order went in with someone else's email address. Today, a gentleman named Zenas at Seagate's "Fulfillment Dept.(?)" in Oklahoma, informed me that the order had been cancelled, and I had no recourse for making the purchase at the same price. Thanks, Seagate Sales. I will look for good service elsewhere.
Just hooked up my 2 TB Seagate GoFlex Desk .. Got it at Costco and it came with the Replica software ... Seagate ROCKS !!!
I have a problem with SeaTools Test Code :A3D8D966? What it meant? Can you answer my question?
I am looking for a portable external hard drive of 1TB capacity to back up my C:Drive which has all Program Files etc. Can you suggest the right product from Seagate range? Thanks.
I need to store 15 TB of data for personal use. I am using just a home pc with all four SATA drives loaded. How do i extend my storage. What is NAS? can i use it.
Having horrible issues with my Momentus XT, engaged Seagate per instructions on Seagate Forums, but no response in over two weeks. Feeling left out to dry by you guys, who is empowered to help me?

Thank You so very much, I've just won a prize :) 
can you please stock more nom yougurts as i love to try new flavors
I went to iceland shopping this morn and there is some great deals on, i never shop any where apart from here, food and the prices are great, plus the staff are fantastic...
Going to try the new world chicken tai chicken new products instore now. All why can,t we put pancakes and plum sauce in with the whole crispy duck. or sell pancakes and sauce in the chilled section 
I think Iceland should let us sample all new lines so we can tell customer what their like as we cant buy them all. You wouldnt need much for staff to sample a couple of mouth fulls will be enough. I can remember when we had the oats and seed bread and it was,nt selling so i bought it and butter lurpak and gave samples to staff and customer hence better sales.
Received a signed tshirt this morning. Actually quite disappoined as I have no idea who has signed it? Plus the pen is sort of running out so it doesn't look that good. Would much rather of had a wii game which I could actually use! Anyone know who was supposed to have signed the tshirts?
Got my t-shirt this morning thanks Iceland! signed by Alison Hammond, not sure if worth anything? any Hammond fans out there?? 
Thank you sooo much for my celebrity Wii game . . It came this morning . . . well happy :D

If your going to sponsor Im a celeb this year could you sell a frozen play along pack? with some of those wichety grubs, sheeps test*cles, vomit fruit, brain and other "im a celeb" favourites? it would be ace to play along!!! (please click like if you like this idea!)
My daughter has been enjoying meal for one Lasagne for ages and now today, we are unable to buy her some due to the allergy warning saying may contain nuts - never been on there before today and wondered why this is now the case. x
Thank you for the Wii Game which arrived safely. It will go towards my 'Comping for Charity Challenge' http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/dougal1972
I have just had the Family Takeout box- 5 for tea and it was lush...You must try them they are excellent, plenty left aswell. it has fed 3 of us..
I usually buy the minced beef & onion lattice slice and the chicken latice slice at 1.00 for 2. I have been doing so for many months now and today I was shocked to see 2 minced beef & onion lattice slices priced at this 1.25 each or 2 for 2.00 where is the saving in that when I usually buy 2 packs at 1 a pack any way, so basicly if you want 1 pack look elsewhere. I know vat as gone up but thats a joke, please kindly explain further. Other than that it pays to check before you buy
hi i work for iceland in the sleaford store and i really love pringles but we have never sold salt and vinegar ones which are my favourite how cm we dnt do them and have bbq and prawn plavour instead ive been to other stores and they dnt seem to have them either

Looking for ideas for quick and easy teas? Why not try one of our fab family sized meals? Serve it with some tasty veg and finish it with a dessert - perfect!
thank you iceland for the wii game looks pretty cool
Whats happened to the cheese and ham kievs. They disappeared before xmas & I thought it was to make room for the xmas stock but they have never come back :( my partner and I are really missing them!
Really loving the new noodle bowls and they are very well priced at 2.50 but i felt that there were far to much noodles compared to the meat and vegtables and therfore wasted a third of the portion. Could you also tell me if there any plans to bring back the chicken with the nacho topping, They were a regular in our house until Christmas when they were nowhere to be seen.
About 10 years ago i visited the Iceland store in my town.I came out without buying anything,as the freezers were dirty and many of the boxes/packets were split or broken.A few days ago i went to the new Iceland which has been open about a yeay.Well i was very impressed.I would have bought more items,but the shop didn't have any forms for the bonus card.Therefore i didn't qualify for the free delivery. I am going back on Saturday and i hope i can get a card then.
Not happy at all with iceland 3 times i have brought a ready meal (2 pub grubs & one corn beef hash) & they had been REFROZZEN! & Also brought a packet of bacon & the when i got it home i noticed it wasnt sealed and was abit green, luckily i got a refund on the bacon but not the meals, i normally love iceland but this has put me off, maybe its just the winchester store? but still not right! <3
Wish your Swindon store would stock more of the Weight Watchers Meals. Have to keep going to Tesco for more variety
Have you guys stopped selling Chicken and Onion pizza's? I was in my local store today and they don't seem to stock them anymore :( 
I've recently purchased 3 family lasagnes from my local store (at various times over the last month or so) and although they are lovely each time we have opened them the dish has been broken and i have had to transfer the contents to another dish to cook and had to pick out bits of plastic before cooking.
have just had the noodle bowl, duck in hoi sin sauce and it is lovely!! will definately be buying again yum!!
Thank you for my Wii game which i picked up from delivery office this morning, as missed the postie yesterday xx
Regarding the noodle bowls at 2.50, have you checked the salt content out! Nearly 6gms in the chilli beef one. Thats not healthy!
What happened to your own range of healthy low fat foods?
New Uniforms coming in this week .....mixed thoughts about them from our store but as this year's service champion got the chance to see them first hand in Oct down Birmingham at the conference .....i think they look smart but i guess everyone else may just think different ..........
Just bought the Family Take Out Box for 5 from Iceland, great value, absolutely fab but one big problem is that it would not fit into my freezer or fridge. Just a redesign on the packaging is needed!!!
PLYMSTOCK PLYMOUTH BRANCH, WILL B PAYING THEIR RESPECTS 2 WORK COLLEAGUE ANDY CAMBELL HOME DELIVERY DRIVER, R.IP. ANDY.
Hi there, can anyone tell me how the Pizza Family combo is like?? The one that comes with chicken wings, wedges, etc? Thank u!
is really missin the hotdog pizza 
Has anyone had half there food missing when you have had a home delivery?
Please please please we need RED CHEESE back at the Mansfield store
I work for Iceland but last Friday i bought 2 of those noodle dishes..beef in i think hoisin sauce & the other beef definitely in satay sauce!! Both were very yummy thoroughly enjoyed them will buy them again. I will recommend them to all our customers :)
Just came across Iceland's silly policy of not allowing you to use debt card if you have items under 10 Euro. It happened in Ballyfermot, Dublin. I can't shop in place where you can't pay how you want. It's 2011 for God's sake.
Fancy a treat without the fuss? Then try our Family Takeout Box! With a loaded 12" Pepperoni Pizza, 8 Chicken Wings, Spicy Potato Wedges plus 8 Garlic Slices, it's all you need for a great night in.
Hi Iceland, Could you please advise when you are going to put CCTV cameras in the stun and kill area of the slaughterhouses you use?

Hi Iceland! Any chance you're bringing the bags of frozen cous cous back for the summer? 
Struggling for ideas for a quick and tasty tea? We've got just the thing. Battered Cod with Crinkle Cut Chips and Garden Peas, plus Apple Crumble to finish. Perfect
just had iceland deliverd yay pizza time
hi iceland will you ever be getting the beef wellington back in you had a christmas, and the vegetables in the pots to the bangor n.store they where devine.
I recently got a job at one of your stores and im concerned about the uniform! Just how big do you produce your shirts and trousers as im a plus size man so wondering if you can do uniforms for me?
Dear Iceland ,I have just taken the oppertunity to look at your website, to complete utter disapointment. The website does not offer anything close to what is on offer in your stores. Its representation of the quality of what Iceland can offer as a food supplier is to be honest, a waste of time and effort and sexist. Not only does it show minimal items, but you can't even place an order for delivery online, pathetic. You present your company as being convenient and modern, especially to mothers, well i find this insulting and unequal. I have shopped at iceland for 10 years or more,i remember going with my dad, he used to do shopping 30 years ago, he must of been ahead of his time.Iceland needs to change its image as a sexist, 1960's food supplier and to come into the 21st century. Men do shop, do work and are parents. Iceland you have let me down, let parents down, let fathers down, let Malcolm Walker down, but most of all you let your selves down.
Lemon pudding YUMMY
hey iceland i bought some of your hot & spicy chicken wings and the salt & pepper ones nd i've went to make a packet today only to find that the microwave instructions aren't on the packet anymore, why is this??
This week's product of the week is already a favourite with lots of people! It's the duck hoisin noodle bowl. Here's what Ellie thought: This is one of the new range of noodle bowls from Iceland and although it says serves one it is a very generous portion. I was amazed at how authentic tasting this dish was. It could have come straight from the Chinese takeaway and that isnt always the case with cook at home Chinese food. The duck pieces were big and tender and the hoisin sauce was delicious. The noodles did not taste as if they had been frozen, but as if they had just come out of a wok. I would recommend this dish to all Chinese food lovers and just cant imagine anyone being disappointed in its quality and price.
hi icelands..i woz wonderin if u woz plannin 2 bring back ur hotdog pizza..its a great fav in my house an we miss it very much...thanks..xxx

I love this page it really gives me support!
I recently rejoined Weight Watchers. I am a lifetime member and looking forward to loosing the weight again. Recently had lasgna at at a friends house but measured it out and ate a salad with it and fruit for desert. I had someone comment that I shouldn't eat that when I'm on a diet. Just want to inform you it's not a diet it's a life change.
WOOHOO!!! Stepped on the scale this morning and lost another pd! That is a loss of 16 pds in 5 weeks and 3 days.. Looking to loose 33 more. Looking at 10 at a time instead of the big picture.. My reward for my loss is just dance 2 for the Wii... Happy Valentine's day everyone!!!! 
Happy Valentines Day to my WW's friends!!:)
So excited!! It's Valentine's Day and I've officially lost 10 lbs in 4 wks on WW points+. <3'n it!! Lots more to go, one day and pound at a time. : )
Okay, I finally signed up online for ww, but a little scared on having 29 points plus to eat. I was on 25 with the old system and if I went over just 2 points, I'd gain maybe .2. I'm really thinking hard about making the vegetable soup that is on the site...looks yummy. I hope I will be able to do this, but with everyones support, I shouldnt have a problem. Wish me luck!!!
I just had a baby 5 weeks ago and I am starting on Weight Watchers after my 6 week check up. I did it right before I got pregnant and lost 20 pounds in 2 months. I have about 60 I want to lose this year. It is a daily struggle for me but I know if I take it one day at a time I can do it!!
wint the soup u r taking about
Need HELP! This is my first week and I'm very nervous about going out for V-Day. I looked up the special menu and I need help with the points... Spinach salad w/ goat cheese, pine nuts, & oranges, 2 Lump Crab Cakes, and i'm splitting a chocolate mousse cake with my fiance. HELP!
Tried the WW Smart Ones Artisan Creation-Savory Steak and Ranch for dinner tonight...so yummy!!
I teach music at an elementary school and today one of my student's mom (who knows I'm doing WW) brought me a package of "Dole mixed fruit" for Valentines Day! I told her it was exactly what I wanted on Valentine's Day...and something I could eat! :) What a thoughtful Mom! Hope you all had a great day and avoided the temptations...
so i'm making my turkey chilli and i just used the recipe builder and was shocked that both chilli powder and ground cumin have points! (i'm making a big pot and use 3 cap fulls of chilli (4 tps) and 2 caps of cumin (4) what?? still my chilli is very low in pts. 
every time i thought about eating choc. today (v-day candy) i ate a strawberry dipping it in truvia! it got me thru the day. can't wait for some good Louisiana strawberries! 
i really hopeing and praying ww will help me loose weight i feel like i cant because i have low thyroid and i have gained 50 pounds because of the low thyroid and i know people who have low thyroid have a very very hard time looseing weigh so really hope i can loose wight with ww 
 THIS IS MY FIRST WEEK. HE BEGINNING OF incredulously AND EATING A LOT BUT NOT AFRAID TO LOSE WEIGHT If you ate ALL POINTS. And SURPRISE .. I've lost 1.9 KILOS IN MY FIRST WEEK. I LOVE WW 
So I wanted to have a bagel thin for breakfast - and I go to foods to see how many points whipped cream cheese was...it said 2 tbsp 0 points! I was so happy but suspicious - so I put it through the calculator and it's 2 points! What gives?
This is my first week with WW and it is going great I even have someone who I work with who is supporting me and I am supporting her. "I am READY for the me"
2nd day and feel light and airy...lol....I have my meal planned out through the rest of the day and still have 7 points after dinner! 
Just attended my first meeting this morning...Soooo excited!!
i used the recipe builder to "pulg in" my favorite from scratch blueberry muffin recipe and i swapped out the fat for apple sauce, and butter extract, sugar for splenda with fiber, and incresed the bb's to make it more moist, the result : My 6 yr old can't tell the differance!! that says a lot! and one is 2 pts! yea! 
Just went to my first meeting this afternoon with new system.. I have lost 70 pounds on the old one about 8 years ago ..kept it off for a while and now i have gained 30 pounds.ughh I am hoping to get used to this new plus points system and that it works as well this time for me as it did with the old points ;)
Just ate a Weight Watchers mint ice ceam sandwich and loved it
okay, i cant seem to find the point value for green/black olives...can someone help?
Going to my first meating in a long time.I have a 100 pounds to loss.Wish me luck please.
struggling this week! Too much candy in the house right now and I LOVE chocolate anything!
have you ever made a fire? have you noticed that if you pile on a bunch of logs it burns super fast then goes out, and if it only has, say 3 logs it seems to have a steady constant burn longer, i think this is the same for our bodies and food we eat. you want the right "fuel" to keep that "fire" buring long and steady . just something i was thinking about :-)
I have been on the points plus program since the first of the year and have lost 6 pounds. I gained a pound this week. My problem is eating after I get off work at 11pm. Also I am not one of those people that if I am having a craving, I can just eat a couple of bites and be satisfied. Does anybody have any ideas of what I can do for both?
Hi there! Today is the first day of my second week. I lost .4 but I for4got to take off my shoes. So they said it would be at least 1 lb. I'm enjoying it and my husband came on board with me for support. My sister also joined to help herself and we can support each other too. 
today's super yum discovery. 1/2 cup oats (not instant or quick), 1 cup unsweetened plain almond milk, 1 cup water. Boil 12 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple in its own juice, 2 tsp hersheys special dark cocoa powder (unsweetened). Stir well, eat and enjoy CHOCOLATE OATMEAL. 5 points plus. (1 tbsp cocoa powder is 0 points plus)
I can't find the Chocolate Cream Cakes anywhere? Is it just a transistion for the new PP packaging to come out? I do hope they get back on the shelves soon.
just got back from the meeting :( gain of .8 but its a new week! oh just tried a tip fresh cut apples sprinkled with just a little bit of sugar free cherry jello taste like candy apples - just made some and it does remind me of that! good tip! 
I began weight watchers online yesterday. I'm still figuring it out. Hoping for the best!

I'm so happy i found more butternut squash at the store - they had been out made last week hard for me, it satisfied that carb craving for me! 
Can someone tell me what a regular slice of pizza is with the new points plus program
Frustrated! 2 weeks ago I gained 1 pound, last week I lost 2 and today when I weighed myself I didn't loose anything! I know it is because I cannot workout due to a car accident in early December...I just started physical therapy this week...but I can't really do anything but stretching! I guess I just need encouragement and some ideas. Thanks!
ok ww sisters and brothers,,,Tonight I went out to dinner and went over 14 points. I still have about 30 extra, but i'm worried the little splurging i did is gonna cost me. I recorded everything from my steak and mushrooms, all the way down to the egg and croutons in my salad....I weigh in again Monday morning, so I was gonna be xtra good this weekend...should I drink more water than my usual 6-8 glasses?????
I just joined WW on line so, I'm hoping to find some hints here. I completely suck at losing weight. Just wanna put it out there:-)

hi does anyone know how many pro points lasagne sheets are? x
The last couple of weeks on the scales have not been great. VERY SLOW loss. I'm getting discouraged because i'm not over eating...don't even use all my points most days, and I spend about 14-16 hrs a week in the gym. Now this could cause emotional eating!!!! My friend who is a doctor recommends cutting out carbs. FAILURE waiting to happen for sure if i do that...Man i am bummed today! 
new lemon bars are delicious
you have to get some specal k crackers! they are great! esp. with laughing cow cheese or the ww cheese wedges. what a great snack to keep me from pigging out after 3 pm cravings hit. 
Hi! I new it was too good to be true....Barilla whole grain pasta 0 Points per serving is what the website says...but, of course it is not true. They didn't count the 41 g of carbs. Please update.....:)
how do you convert 1tsp (teaspoon) into 2c (cups) & how would you point out 2c of sugar into one galloon of tea. also my husband won't let me buy anything BUT hamburger & chicken. I shop at the Commisary (which is a military facility) and there is NO nutritional info on the packaged meat. How do I configure my points value for them? Any help would be AMAZING to booting my "loosing power" and motovation. Thank you!

I have a very hard time finding ww products in the grocery stores in EL Paso, TX. I have only been able to find cream cheese and ice cream products. I would love to find other things like snacks. Any idea when we will have a better selection here?
So is it possible for a beer (Select 55) to be 0 calories...I plugged in the numbers and it says 0...but I dont believe it!
good morning...i keep reading reciepes with Jimmy dean turkey sausage crumbles for 2pp. I live in Canada and dont think that we have them...does anyone know what we have here that would be the same.... 
How many points do you think would be in the dunkin donuts egg white veggie sandwich without the cheese? I know it is 7 with...
I just had a Weight Watchers breakfast burrito.. Sooo good :) They say for 2 it's 7 points, but i only ate 1.. Wonder how many points that would be?
does anyone know what the points plus is for the cupcakes made with devils food cake mix and a can of blackbeans. i know it sounds gross but it is really good.
Anyone know the points for a McDonalds Shamrock Chake w/o whipped cream?
i have an idea that i think would go great at the ww meetings : let us know the week prior too, let every one with the same # of daily points group together or just do a buddy and then everybody brings a copy of there journal so we can get fresh new ideas of what's available for 29ppt, and 31ppt... i think it would be helpful and they may know something good that i haven't found yet!

Found Veggie Straws at Sam's Club last night-very, very good. Serving is 36 straws for 3 pts. Its all natural and very tasty.

The way I feel is that any loss is a triumph on the scale whether it is .2 or 2.00. The magic words for me are you went down---pounds.
Has anyone ever made a diet coke cake? I use a chocolate cake mix and a can if Diet Coke. How do I calculate the points? 
I have just added exercise to my diet and I am using the online tools only. I noticed that when I put in the activity points it doesn't deduct from them when I use the points instead it deducts from my weekly points. Does anyone else have that issue? Also the extra points I rarely use them, but if I were to start would I notice a difference in my weight loss weekly? Any thoughts on this??
Hi everyone I just had my first WI and drop 5.2 pounds.I am so happy.Loving the online WW but I need the meetings also.Have a great day..Making soup today 
I'm sticking to this program... I really like the flexability. I made the soup, with Kale instead of cabbage it was great... 
I have become a fan of greek yogurt!!! Fruit on the bottom - 3 points and actually filling!!! On the look out now for the Morning Star corndogs - 1 large = 4pp's, 4 small= 4 pps!!
hey fellow WW'rs my meeting was this AM and drum roll.... lost 3.8 this week! starting week 5 today total loss is 11.4! love the points plus! 
Strawberry smoothie bars...HEAVEN!!!!! They may be a bit pricey, but there are 12 in a box, much better than just 4-6! ;) SO worth it to me
ok! so I am going to put it out there. I have yest to see it. I like my wine..I like to come home from wor and have a few glasses once the kid is asleep..I have gone way down with it but should I cut it our all together or still have a few glasses?????anyone else with this problem and can realte to it ? I am also on vacation next week in florida...I know that it will be a bit of a probem then..
Is a food scale an important tool to have?
Just made a sesame noodle dinner from the hungry girl cookbook.....it was 5 points and wonderful!!!!
This is my 3rd day on the program. The first day I blew it. Yesterday wasn't too bad, but I ate a small slice of pizza, which took me over. Today I am like 6 points under which is crazy to me because I wan't really hungry most of the day like yesterday. Bananas helped me get through, but I still didn't make it to my total. I also don't really get the multivitamin/mineral. Any suggestions to get that one?
I am trying to calculate the points per serving for my baking and does anyone know how this makes sense....in the book it says 1 cup of sugar is 22 points and 1 cup of sugar substitute is 23 points???? Is this correct?
The WW mint chocolate chip ice cream is HANDS DOWN the best mint chocolate chip ice cream I've EVER had! It tastes just as good as Baskin Robbins or Kay's! Doesn't taste artificial at all! I HIGHLY recommend it, too! The single serving cups are genius! It's just enough! :]
had my weigh in today and I lost 3 pounds!! that was my goal I set for myself this week and I am so psyched to have achieved it! just one step closer to my 5%!!
wanted chicken n dumplins but tweeked it: i drained the onions, and meat and carrots then puree'd them saved the sauce, (only used 2 tbsp flour) then i filled won tons with teaspoons of this filling and steamed them reduced the sauce added the dumplings ! it is better than i thought! and very filling in this bad weather. - now to go calculate the points. 
this may be funny, but does anyone else decide what to ware to the meetings based on how light the clothing is? i have a pair of jeans that's 2 lbs!!! i do see people shucking off all kinds of clothes in the meetings - i just take my jacket and shoes off. 
does anyone know the points value of ground chicken???? and the serving??
TOM is right around the corner and I feel the cravings coming on.....dang it! A Wendy's Frosty and fries sounds SO good....urgh! 
I went to my meeting tonight and lost another 1.6lbs. I am down 11lbs in 4 weeks and couldnt be happier!!!!
just got my ww app on i phone makes life easier to track
I have not been able to exercise to much due to a car accident in early December...I started WW online 4 weeks ago tomorrow (weighing myself tomorrow), I have lost 9.5 lbs but that is all due to changing my eating...my chiropractor doesn't want me to do anything but get on the eliptical w/o the arms and the bike...this is starting to become boring...I can't do weight training which is driving me nuts! Any ideas? 
wants to lose just 5 more pounds...i can do this...i can do this..i can do this..right? haha
So proud of myslef I lost 6lbs prior to starting WW because my doctor told me to watch my food intake. Diabetes and heart disease run in my family, I am ok for now. At my last Docts appt, she told me to join WW and I did. It is the best thing I have done for myslef. I lost 4 lbs in my first week so I am down a total of 10lbs in 3 weeks =) I can not believe that I have not had soda or sweet tea (southern style which is super sweet) in 3 weeks and it feels great....Looking forward to being healthier
This quote was shared at my meeting last night and it's my new motto! 10 pounds in 5 weeks! Love WW :-) "There's a difference between interest and commitment. When you are interested in doing something, you do it only when it's convenient. When you're committed to something, you accept no excuses-only results." Ken Blanchard
had my weigh in last night. Only down .5 for the second week of the program. I lost 6.6 the first week though. I don't find it hard to follow at all! I might be shooting myself in the foot with fruit though! I'm in for the long haul - 50 lbs to go
I made the coconut shrimp that was in last weeks WEEKLY -- easy and delicious!!
Slow roasted Turkey breast frozendinner for 7 Points plus is at Fairmont Walmart and is delicious!
I find Weight Watchers new point system, on everything in Walmart. Prices are cheaper too. Best place to get them.
I wish I could see more WW brands instead of SmartOnes, like in England... they have yummy Indian Chicken Korma and Shepherds pie and 'bangers and mash there :-) and even their own brand wine with less pts. (yes I'm from England but lived in the US for 12 years) my sister has loads more choices than we do here. 
Vegetable dilemma: If 1/2 C is a portion size for vegetables--In the Lean Cuisine and Smart Ones dinners, the veggie portions are scant, so I can't really check off 1 vegetable serving on the food tracker, can I?? Need to add veggies, therefore more points, to the meal? Must be a better answer
so...what do you eat when you don't feel well? I have NO appetite but I know I should eat. I made a WW shake and my fiance brought me home a bagel because that was the only thing that sounded good! 
i love to eat all day long, and i try to find 1 or 2 point foods. but i wanted to share one of my favorites. i buy the big containers of yogurt. i buy a vanilla one where a half cup is 1 point, and i'll mix strawberries and a banana with it. its like eating a dessert.
I buy FF Cool Whip and add Vanilla, Choc., or any of your favorite puddings and mix together and eat with fruit. I add Butterscotch pudding and eat it with apples and it taste like caramel apples. 
Hi. Does anyone know what the points are for a tall skinny caramel macchiato from Starbuck's. Happy Friday!
tonight's treat: a baked apple : wash, use a mellon baller to remove seeds and leave a hollow to fill with pinch cinnimon, slenda brown sugar, and top with 1 tsp brummel and brown - bake in oven for about 20 - 30 min depending on how soft you like it eat as is or top with fat free redi whip. 
Can anyone tell me I just joined today and I am trying to add the pointplus app to my phone but is says I need to do something online? 
I had my two week weigh in this morning...2 lbs. lost for a total of 8. I am really enjoying this lifestyle change. I guess I did not want to believe healthy foods and correct portions could be so filling and satify cravings. Several nights last week, I had a hard time meeting my daily points. I was full from lunch and did not feel like eating dinner. I discovered a little jewel that allows me to have my ice cream and chocolate without feeling guilty...WW Giant Chocolate Fudge Ice Cream bars (3 pts plus). Thank you to everyone on this page. Reading through the posts has answered many questions and provided a lot of good recipes and tips.
does anyone know the points plus value for Quakers apple cinnamon oatmeal... The weight watchers store is waiting for a shipment of calculaters. 1 pouch is 130 calories, 1.5 grams fat, 27 carbs, and 3 grams fiber. Thanks for your help!
Does anyone have an easy way to skin chicken wings? The drummies aren't too hard to skin, but the next section is impossible unless somebody has a trick. I saw one chef that said if you remove the skin after baking, it's the same as skinning before. Can this be true or just wishful thinking?
Why chocolate is not 0 propoints???? :'(
I would like to know which food stores in Canada sell Weight Watcher's food I've searched the internet and it doesn't give me a particular store. Maybe I'm just searching wrong. Thanks for any suggestions.
i need to find a different group to join, was in Clatskanie had quite possibly the SNOTTIEST leader ever. Just could not stomach how rude she was on a weekly basis,even called weight watchers they just did not seem to care. i had a memeber who had been going for a long time ask me where i had been and told me said leader is rude to everyone and if she does not like you look out. well she was a rude snot the first day i walked in so, so much for first impressions.... does anyone in the longview/kelso area have a nice leader would like to continue just not willing to be treated like crap weekly. 
Why can't I find peanut butter cookies anymore,they are my favorite.Does anyone know if they still make them?
I just found the BEST website for WW recipes.they have the points plus point values, too. It's www.skinnyweek.com You guys and gals might like to take a look....
I lost 4.2lbs the 1st week and only .8 the 2nd... I'm not feeling to good about this.. I didnt change anything from week one to week two
I highly recommend the new cookbook, Just 5! I picked it up at my meeting yesterday and made dinner last night and lunch today. Dinner was sausage with kale and rigatoni and lunch was the egg and broccoli struedel. Both meals fed my family of three and provides leftovers! Delicious!!!! Tonight - Lasagna from the same book!
I joined 3 Feb....first weigh in tomorrow. Cleaned out my cupboards and replaced all with the "shopping list".....I am not a cook, so this is going to be interesting.....hugs
Any one have a good low point crab dip recipe?
What's the best margarine to use for the least point value?
Weight Watchers~ 1st week lost 5.2 2nd week lost 5.2 = total of 10.4 in 2 weeks loving the new points plan for sure.....like the 0 fruits :0
Please join the page Turnin the corner and leave a recipe or two that are healthy and oh so yummy... Also if you have a minute I started a blog to hold me accountable for my weight loss. I've already lost 12pds towards 50 pounds goal and I would love for people to follow me on my crazy journey!!! Thanks so much.. Feedback is always helpful!
I have a juicer and plan to use with for fruits and veggies. Does anyone know if an array of fruits and veggies then become points? If I use the pulp in muffins, how do I figure that out?
I found the most amazing apple struedle recipe on the WW website. It has baked apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, and oats for 4 pts. Add some Edys no sugar icecream and you have a dessert that tastes like it came from a restaurant!
Been reading some post, I think im really goona like this site..Thanks to all you great people on here with advice and support :)
baught some frozen fruits. If I add it up it says 2 pts...I thought fruits were free..Do I add them up or not...Thanks
Is Salmon in the can better than Tuna in the can or are they equal in points?
ok guys can someone tell me what the point value of a green chille Burrito? Just curious!!!
I just joined ww on sat and already having trouble figuring out what the points are on alot of foods. They should have the new calculators in sometime within a week but I am now getting discouraged not knowing what to eat because of points. Anyone have and encouragement and ideas to share?
Would love the recipe for the Cabbage soup in the Getting Started Program if anyone would have it. Thanks! :)

Looking for a recipe that uses angel food cake and lite blueberry pie filling, anybody heard of this?
I just wanted to tell everyone about this new snack...new for me... i found if you like cinnamon twist from taco bell you will love these they are called....sensible portions cinnamon apple straws they are 3 pts for 32 I have only found them at sams 4.00 for a 15oz bag. Im a snacker so i love these.
had a great surprise today- went to dinner at the same diner we go every tuesday. I normally have soup and a salad to take the easy route. I asked questions today and ended up with a fantastic turkey pita sandwich. the turkey was breast meat from turkeys prepared onsite (not processed lunch meat.) Ordered my pita steamed and had a healthy great filling meal. Moral of the story-Ask questions.
just did my first weigh in tonight and need some ideas on snacks cause sometimes i dont have time to eat since i work on private ambulance. i lost 6.2lbs my first week!!
My husband and I love the little local Mexican restaurant but I can't figure out what's the best point value foods......anybody have any suggestions....If it's Mexican, I LOVE it.....
pulling my but back on the wagon after Super Bowl Weekend

well i better go pay my monthly fee to workout - i missed 2 weeks and did great last week but today i just maintained! better not slide now! more determined now! 
discovered today that whole grain pasta is even better than wheat because it has another gram of protein. I'm switching! Found some chicken sausage to put in it and steaned carrots. Very filling and delicious!
we all need support and ideas. Check out great facebook page..Friends who want to weigh less You will find great support and tons of receipes.
HI everyone, hope you are all having a good week.I joined ww online and doing good so .Lives in NLFD ,doesn,t have ww here and can,t buy ww food ,I just reads your comments ,which helps me plus your reciped and ideas.Thanks.
what did you have for breakfast? i love my b-fast but getting tired of it and looking for other ideas mine was: one flat out light (2pts) red. fat provalonecheese (1pt) sauted peppers (0) 1/4 cup eggbeaters cooked (1pt) and one slice turkey bacon (1pt) - all wraped up then th whole thing brown'd crisp (very good and a lot for 5pts)
woohoo. lost another 2lbs this week i just love this new points plus program =0)
question: if i mixed 1 tbsp honey with 1 tbsp PB then only ate on tbsp of that doesn't that make my PB a little lower in points? or better yet mix it with sugar free log cabin syrup - i'm trying to wrap my brain around it 
did anybody watch Oprah today with Jennifer Hudson, was just wondering what people thought. I didnt like Liz.......
Hello All, I joined WW online Monday and have lost 3.6 pounds.. Can this be? was that just water weight? I'm so happy and more driven than ever to keep going..I tell myself if I bit it go and write it.I had lost 100 pounds 10 years ago, going for 260 down to 160.. and 35 pounds just slipped right back on over the years, So I started WW.. so far so good..
Iam happy to report thanks to some support from friends and WW Iam offically down15lbs! Woo Hoo!
Weighed in today, lost 2pds! I love to snack on crunchy foods, crackers, pretzels etc. Does WW have any low point snacks that I can substitute for these? 
Needs to figure out why I just went downstairs to get a bowl of oatmeal and instead shove my face with a bag of chips.., I'm down 15, have 4 more to go, to hit my 2nd goal of 10% and this is what I do... I don't understand and Now I'm irradiated.. Ugh!!!

Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies.
We made the All-Beef Glazed Meatloaf and it was great and also turned out nicely!
Next one we made was the Classic Macaroni and Cheese - it was really good and creamy.
We made the Bianca pizza dough it was unbelievable how nice and fluffy the dough was.
ultimate chocolate cupcakes
Chocolate Bundt Cake with Orange Glaze
Quick and Hearty Chicken Noodle Soup
adapted Sticky Slow Cooker Wings (used drumsticks instead of wings)
I made these Ultimate Chocolate Cupcakes with Ganache Filling for hubby's Valentine's Day treat!
I made the Blueberry Scone recipe from ATK....along with several others this week.These are by far the BEST scones. Yummmy :)
this isnt from any of yalls recipes but i just had to share them because im so proud they came out so good!
(i think this is a cooks country recipe...not sure but i will post these over there as well!) croissant dough!!!
look at all those layers of butter.
some of these are the chocolate upcakes from the recent episode that i made with yalls quick buttercream with vannilla bean frosting! (best frosting i have ever eaten)
My ATK Memorable Meatloaf
My ATK Chicken Saltimbocca
Tried the Anytime Muffins today and added blueberries. They are simply delicious! The recipe called for a 12 cup muffin tin. Next time, I think I will make 18 muffins. Maybe my muffin tin is a little on the smaller side, I'm not sure, but I had extra batter after filling the tin, but I managed to use it all. They really puffed up and ended up being connected to their neighbor, but they are sooooo good! Also, be generous with PAM when spraying the tin.
Slow-cooker sticky wings paired nicely with a pizza
love the show, love the cookbooks. today I will try to roast a whole chicken. I don't feel afraid to cook new things with the ATK book.
Have y'all done a recipe for cabbage & pork soup? Or pumpkin bread?
I made the crisp roast chicken recipe today and it was divine! Very flavorful, moist, juicy, crispy chicken. A keeper for sure. Forgot to take a picture. :)
Looking for a recipe for a drop type cookies that I think has chocolate and ginger, crystallized pieces of ginger, maybe chocolate chips or raisins, crisp on outside, soft/tender inside...had them at a bakesale...
I would love an allergy episode. What are the best peanut butter alternatives, best way to bake without eggs (apple sauce, bananas, Bob's Red Mill replacer . . .), replacing dairy (making buttermilk with soy milk and vinegar?), gluten free flour . . . . 
Coffee... definitely coffee!
Argh! Does anyone have recommendations about cooking quick breads EVENLY? Inevitably the middle is a soft doughy mess if the ends are even remotely close to moist. Contrarily, if you cook the loaf so that the middle is moist but done, the ends of the loaf are dry (i.e. NOT moist, hard crust,etc).
Best dinner! Long-Cooked Meat Ragu (made with St. Louis style pork ribs vs. beef short ribs) with Creamy Polenta...made with 3 c water and 3 c milk, onion and parm). 
 I'm trying to learn how to make hash browns. Not the patties but the shredded potato hash browns. What type of potato should be used? What are some cooking techniques? I know the potato has to be fairly dry, are there some ways of achieving this?
CI's oven-baked brown rice was a big hit last night with my Shrimp and Okra Gumbo. I doubled the rice recipe for dinner. And then baked another double batch to take with me to a potluck. Everyone wanted the recipe. Thanks ATK! :o)
Hello ATK. Absolutely love your show! Just have on question, why did you put coriander an cumin in your Chicken Enchiladas with Red Chile Sauce (season 5)? I cannot find a authentic enchiladas recipe with those spices included, anywhere. 
Bridget's Antipasto Pasta Salad looks absolutely yummy! Thanks for sharing , I can't wait to try it.
What is a good substitute for wine in recipes?
I just got a huge stack of Cook's Illustrated from my parents, dating back to 2002. Perfect! Saw a mention of a "New Show coming soon!" for ATK.
Love ATK, Cooks Illustrated, etc., but just took the Cooks Illustrated survey that was emailed to us and it was so poorly written that I had to exit out mid-way through. How am I supposed to answer questions like "What size cast iron skillet do you have?" Well, we have three; 8 inch, 10 inch and 12 inch; yet the survey only allowed one answer. This happened multiple times in the survey. What is the quality of info are you going to receive from questions so poorly written/designed? Stick to cooking ATK, CI, CC; leave the surveying to experts. Whew, feel better now!
the recipe for CIABATTA BREAD uses a mixer. I don't have one, can I KNEAD the dough by hand, and for how long?.thanx.
Argh, Christopher Kimball -- You said "Jirardelli" chocolate on the radio just now. It's "Ghirardelli" with a hard "g", as in "ghee". That's what the "h" is for! Very cool piece on chocolate tasting. I learned a lot.
For those of you who helped me today, thank you! I can now make the tofu with sweet chili sauce. YAY!
I am trying to replicate a wonderful icebox lemon pie I had this summer in Wisconsin. It had a pecan/shortbread crust, then a layer of vanilla ice cream, then a layer of what I think was lemon curd, and topped with what I believe was 7 minute frosting. Has anyone had such a dessert, and do you think that lemon curd and 7 minute frosting will keep its texture after being frozen?
I love that you show practical way to get things to work in your own kitchen. There have been several times that I will be baking or cooking and think about something I saw on your show and try it and it makes the dish that much better. Thank you ATK and PBS for having this show and making the Create Channel for those of us without cable. Thank you!:)
Can I substitute melted butter when a batter recipe calls for a small amount of heavy cream? 
I made your rich and creamy cheesecake over the weekend - absolutely amazing. But the middle was a little runny...did I just not cook it long enough?
I love the shows, the books and the magazines... but please figure out how to stop blasting me with buy this-buy that emails and mailings! I've already bought everything there is to buy!
I'm baaack! Trying to get the frosting recipe for chocolate cupcakes with ganache, I believe it is the malted milk chocolate that I want and yes again, I have to re-sign up to get a recipe - why does Chris Kimball say "every recipe" available - NOT TRUE. Besides I am a subscriber and I still cannot get a recipe!!!!
Where do I find the recipe for that killer Blueberry Grunt you made the other day?? I can't stop thinking about it especially with this cold weather we've been having! 
Have you done a show about High Altitude adjustments?? I keep trying to bake your recipes and they always come out soooo dry.
So I was just watching the news and saw the contraband seized in a drug bust. It included ATK's highest rated kitchen scale. I'll stick to baking bread with it. 
Hi. I'm from Singapore and tried baking the 'Quick Cinnamon Buns' from your Family Baking Book (pg 88) just now. Got a couple of questions to ask. After adding the buttermilk and butter, the dough was very sticky to handle. Was that normal? I had to add almost a half cup of flour in order for it to be able to be rolled out. Where could I have gone wrong? Could the individual cut pieces be baked in paper cups?
wish someone over here can tell me why my marinara sauce tastes metalic(my kids call it clam sauce). Doesn't matter which tomatoes, which recipe, and its not the pan i do not think. Only thing in the all clad pot is canned tomatoes, olive oil, fresh garlic salt and oregano. What makes it always tast this way someome please, it never used to.
I want to buy the newest all inclusive book too, but amazon reviews are killing this book saying that is no way complete. What to do?
How do I unsubscribe the autosubscribe I ended up on by purchasing a book through your website? All I can find on the website is a forum complaining about it but no solution...I want to choose my cookbooks not find one in my mailbox every month. 
The Cook's Illustrated website no longer lists "chicken" as a main ingredient when browsing recipes. Is that intentional?! Because it's obnoxious.
I make the Pepperoni Pan Pizza recipe all the time, but I was wondering if there was a similar recipe that would use whole wheat flour instead of AP?
I have a question. On page 370 of The American Test Kitchen cookbook the recipe, Spicy Honey Glaze, calls for cumin. Do I use ground cumin or whole cumin? 
i made the scalloped potato recipe from the cover & bake book. I server it with a glazed ham. My husband asked when i would make it again. very good.
I LOVE your show!!! Gotta question: On all the shows, you usually say not to use Rump Roast for the meat. This cut is usually very cheap. What can I make with it?
I love you ATK. I make the Chicken Tikka Masala all the time and it has now become a family favorite. Just this morning I made the Turkey Breakfast Sausage from the Healthy Family Cookbook and it was phenom!!!! 
I just got my new Rada Chef's Knife -- $15.00. You should test it. They are fabulous. I love your shows!
I HAD A YEARS SUBSCRIPTION OF THE MAGAZINE COOKS COUNTRY I GOT AS A GIFT AND I LOVED IT! ! I WATCH EVERY CHANCE I CAN AND TRY TO FIND EPISODES ON LINE THAT I MISSED. I ALMOST NEVER BUY ANYTHING BEFORE SEEING IF THERE IS A TEST ON IT! It has confirmed many purchases and changed my mind on others, a very reliable honest source that I cherish. I was born and raised in NH, and in my adult years when I learned the benefit of high quality products and that we are worth it for all our hard work. Every time we needed good bacon or if we were out of maple syrup we went to Vermont for a day or two. Just a great weekend get away. Funny but we might have driven by Christophers house quite a few times and not even known it, if only I had I would have said hello and thank you for sure! Tim, Tampa FL.. 
Made your Chicken and Dumplings last week, fast easy and delicious. You are my fav chefs
I just watched your show (on VPTV) about slow cooking pork and baked apples. I would like to ask that in addition to time and temp for conventional ovens you give time and temp for those of us using convection ovens.
I just signed up and looked at the recipes. Unfortunately there are hardly any you can see unless you sign up for a premium membership. Bummer 
think i will try your baked stuffed shrimp as our valentine dinner!
Anyone know of a good resource for pressure cooker dinner recipes--other than the basic beef stew and chili?
Just watched show on Red Velvet Cake and Cold Pound Cake. Both look very yummy and would be nice for a celebration or guests. Once in a while will be ok!! 
I ordered the Season 10 cookbook and DVD set for a Christmas present on 12.19. The cook was finally delivered about a week ago, but I keep getting the runaround on the DVD's. The website has an expected ship date one day, then an out of stock notice the next day. Phone customer service is no help; I get no response over e-mail. I'm extremely disappointed in the service all around from ATK.
Cannot download the Valentine booklet. Tried to click and it loops Baker to the "like" page. Any suggestions?
Hey fans, I am looking for some suggestions on nutrient dense foods . . . 
Does the America Test Kitchen have a recipe for a cobbler that cooks up over the fruit. If not I do. I'd be happy to share and see if you can improve it but it's the only cobbler I make. If something isn't broken why fix LOL. 
Does anyone know if the Texas pink grapefruit bars need to be refridgerated. I made some and planned on taking some on vacation but now am having second thoughts because of all the eggs in them.
Cooking black beans is a snap in a slow cooker..they are so perfect..adding all the ingredients, plus lime juice makes this dish just perfect....cook on slow all nite..you can't go wrong
My favorite dish for the slow cooker is pork and sauerkraut. YUM!
This may sound like a silly question, but what do I use "Black Truffle Oil" for? I was given some by someone who knew I did a lot of cooking and baking but to be honest, I've never even heard of it before! 
My husband and I made an awesome ATK Valentine's Day Southern Style dinner together- Fried catfish, corn oysters (a best lost recipe), and Buttermilk Caramel Cake! Everything was marvelous but the corn oysters were our very favorite!
I have a favorite barbecue beans recipe with five different kinds of beans, corn, onion and sauce. YUM. Love that slow cooker!
I just made the Blueberry cobbler. It was so good and gone before I could take a picture. Next time I will double it.
Tried to cook brown rice in my new slow-cooker last night -- was disappointed to find that it didn't work because it wasn't 2/3 full as recommended. I used the Crockpot 6.5 quart touchscreen, and the recipe called for 3 cups of water and 2 cups of rice, nowhere near enough to fill up the pot. Do I need to double the recipe to get enough food in the crockpot to make it work correctly?
Anyone have any advice on cutting beef femur bones? We were very grateful to get grass fed beef bones but they came whole and we are at a loss on how to cut them?
Does anyone have a good shrimp burger recipie? I surprisingly can't find one on the ATK website.
ATK, On Feb. 10th, you had a trivia question regarding how many pounds of chicken the test kitchen cooks in a week. Did you post the answer yet? Didn't know if I missed it. :)
Williams-Sonoma confirmed to me (see their FB page) that their Goldtouch pans - which you have recommended - are made from 65% recycled steel! They're also made in the US - they're made by USA Pan. I love USA Pan pans, but they don't brown very well - I will have to go to WS to check out the Goldtouch!
I love your show and the recipes are usually the best out, but I just have one problem. Whenever I go to my local "super"market I can't find the cuts of meat needed for the recipes. I ask for them by name and the personnel look at me like I'm nuts. I live in the northeast so you'd think there would be no problem finding any cut, or butcher if the afore mentioned market didn't have it. You'd be wrong. Any suggestions?
I just picked up ATK's Light & Healthy magazine and I love it. I just made the Mexican Shredded Pork last night and I have a quick question. Does the recipe really call for 1 tablespoon of the ground chipotle powder or was it supposed to read 1 teaspoon? I love spicy food, but even this was a little too spicy for me! Just wanted some clarification...thanks!
Okay today has been a kitchen day - my husband and I have been baking and cooking all day - We have made the Chocolate Roll, rice pudding and now working on the French Onion Soup! All from the Complete ATK cookbook - so far everything is working out nicely! Will post the pics soon! 
Love the Slow Cooker Revolution cook book. Thanks AT your Thai-Style soup is soo good and so many others.
Can't wait to try to Pork Shoulder with Peach Sauce!
I just made your Maple-Glazed Pork Tenderloin for the second Sunday in a row. It's just that good! And it's so simple to make. 
Madi the chicken with the lemon sauce on your skillet recipes episode it was awesome!
Helen "Peggy" Mowry loves the show and videos online.
Your Multigrain bread From the "Rolls and Loaves" episode is absolutely awesome! It always comes out perfect. My husband can't wait for it to cool before attacking it with a bread knife. I make two loaves about every other week. It goes great with my homemade soup. 
I plan to make the beef empanadas from the may/june 2010 issue. Is Maseca the same as masa harina?
Are there plans for a homemade, whole wheat pasta recipe (or homemade whole grain) in either upcoming magazine? I've only come across the one in the "Cook's Illus"Jan/Feb '94 issue (p19) and didn't see one in the green "ATK Healthy Family Cookbook". Thanks.
Would love to see you provide gluten free variation to your baked good recipes (especially). It is so hard to watch my favorite show knowing I can no longer have many of the delicious items you show. Have you ever considered a show or season where you just cooked and baked for your viewers with food allergies, sensitivities, gluten intolerance and celiac disease? 
I watched the red velvet cake/cold oven pound cake episode of Cooks Country today. Does the cold oven poud cake still work if my oven preheats on convection? My gut tells me no, it won't work, but that recipe looked too good not to try! Please advise, Thanks!!
Tune into The Today Show this morning between 9-10 a.m. Chris Kimball will be cooking from our new bestselling book, Slow Cooker Revolution.
Cooked your Maple-glazed pork tenderloin, last night it was great, my husband even commented how good it was later when he was watching TV. Another favorite form your book. Thanks. 
I made the perfect blueberry pancakes (sans blueberries) for my son for breakfast. I've made them many times in the past, but for some reason, today they were over 3/4" high (yes, I measured, I'm dorky that way)! And so fluffy! Whatever was different this time, I hope it works out again.
Just got your Slow Cooker cookbook from QVC. Spent all evening reading the recipes. I can't wait to make these, even in summer! Thank you for all the work you did to create this book!
I am a very disappointed about my recent online membership with cooks illustrated. As I am looking for recipes, it seems like almost all the recipes I would like to look at require an upgrade in membership. That seems extremely unfair to me because I just paid for a membership for recipes and now I have to pay for a upgrade just to see recipes. What is the point? Anyone else feel this way??????
Love the Cream Cheese Coffe Cake. Love Americas Test Kitchen
I made the tandoori chicken using your recipe. Worked out extremely well. Thanks!
I want to make your stuffed flank steak, but I don't eat pork. Do you have an alternative recipe for the stuffing that doesn't use pancetta?
I just watched the Seafood in a Skillet episode and I was trying to find the T-Fal Professional Total Nonstick Fry Pan that was reviewed, since you said it was safe to 450 degrees. I can't find any T-Fal that says it is safe over 350 degrees. Do you have a model number for the one you reviewed?
We baked a potato frittata for an hour and then tested for doneness with a toothpick and it came out clean. Yet when we cut into it, the frittata was clearly not done. Is there a better way to test for doneness?
I tried to find the recipe using coffee in a barbeque sauce but was unable to do so. Could you reply.
Just a question can I omit all that red wine in the stews and still get a beefier tasting stew! I don't care how little I put I can still taste it and I don't care for it.
Hi - I saw the recent episode where you made that great looking banana bread by microwaving the liquid out of 5 bananas. That seemed like a good idea, but when you microwave bananas doesn't that also zap all the nutrients out of the bananas? Thanks.
how do you make food "sneaky" hot?Where you eat something say chili or salsa and it takes a second for the heat to creep up on you?
I'm guessing my problem isn't all that unique... I have vegetarians in the house, and I've been trying to find suitable substitutes for the meat in the recipes I want to try. Particularly burger. There's tofu and the pre-cooked pieces of "meatless taco meat", but is there anything else I could try?
Last night I made the French Chicken in a Pot. I discussed the "recipe" on my fb page and included the link to the video. Today, 3 friends are making the French Chicken in a Pot! Thanks for giving us this great approach to chicken!
Tried the Cream Cheese Coffee Cake today. Watched the show on Saturday and followed the recipe to the letter. The topping sank to the bottom together with the cream cheese filling. Any suggestions?
Coffee or tea?
Hi folks, let's try this again! It's Trivia Thursday -- How many POUNDS of chicken do you think the test kitchen cooks a week?

I should have broiled a bit more, but yummy nonetheless!

does it count if it's from Cook's Illustrated? Greek Spinach Pie to feed the crowd.
Like many others, I was snowed in yesterday. I decided to make the triple chocolate mousse cake. It was pretty tasty.
I get the weekly email and saw "Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies" in the dinner menu and decided to try making them. These are the results and I have to say they are amazing. It made me fall in love with browned butter to the point that I used it in a frosting recipe as well.
It's Trivia Thursday! We have quite a sweet tooth around here. How many pounds of sugar do you think we go through a week?
Godiva dark chocolate lava cake! Lightly crisp outside, soft in the middle, and melted chocolate oozing out from the center, served with vanilla bean ice-cream and fresh raspberry.....is so yummy! I made this for my valentine!

My first time making Challah Bread from the cookbook....it turned out SO good :)
We've been snowed in and I did lots of baking today! These are the homemade chewy brownies from last Saturday's episode...this is my second batch in 2 days :)
My interpretation of the Cherry Chocolate Chip Cake. It was fun to make. Thank you!
I took the "Peperoni Pizza" recipe and added bacon, onion, mushrooms, and other fun stuff from my kitchen. My 15 year old son said it was the best he had ever eaten! My husband wanted to know when I'd make it again.
I made the Key Lime Pie as one of the dishes I took to a Super Bowl party. I keep the pie tins from old crusts and re-use them because you can reattach the plastic lids and you don't get upset leaving your "dish" behind.
I also made the Tunnel of Fudge cake to take to the party. I decided to make it a bit more "festive" and added some extra bittersweet chips to the top.
One skillet chicken parm
Chocolate Sour Cream Bundt Cake!

Thanks for the chicken pot pie recipe. Stayed home on Wednesday to avoid the snow and freezing rain.

Parents: Which veggies do your kids love?
We wanted to share a fun thing with you today. Over the weekend, we went to see the play Cheaper To Keep Her (starring, among others, Vivica Fox and Brian McKnight), and Vivica Fox mentioned Glory greens! Twice! Is anyone here planning to see the play in your area? How was YOUR weekend?

For homemade croutons: Spread slightly stale bread with butter or olive oil. Cut into cubes. Place bread cubes on foil lined cookie sheet. Sprinkle with garlic powder, oregano, basil or your favorite seasoning blend. Bake at 225 for 20-25 minutes until lightly browned, turning cubes over after about 15 minutes. Use in salads, soups or bread stuffing.
Homemade Apple Crisp
Pick some apples, make some dough! Apples Galore is our newest standard cover and divider set. This design was featured in our standard collection several years ago, and we've decided to bring back this oldie but goodie.

Inexpensive canned biscuits can be used in many different ways! To make cheesy snack crackers, simply roll the dough thin, cut into small squares, add a pinch shredded cheddar cheese and bake until crisp. You can also use them as mini-pizza crusts and add your choice of toppings before baking.
"Avoid fruit and nuts. You are what you eat." ~Jim Davis
Cookies will spread if the dough is too pliable by allowing butter to get too soft. If your cookies are spreading too much, try refrigerating the dough for a few hours before baking.
Valentine's Day will be here before we know it. Here are some lovely ideas we found online that we thought you might like!

Just watched Soup Day. Yummmmm.
Sam...you were AMAZING tonight!! Great show! See you soon at FIO meetings:) ~Jamie
Great show at "Sam Live!" this evening Sam, we hope you enjoyed giving it as much as we did watching it! Seeing a few of your early clips was especially entertaining, e.g. in Tokyo (loved that goatee!), your first demo (now I want to make the Rainy Day Salmon!), etc.
Fantastic show tonight Sam!! Took us over 3 1/2 hrs to drive in from OC in this horrid weather but it was soooo worth it.....the dogs.....the MIA cheese....the lagging visuals! All of it was so YOU and that's what made it great :-)
great night & so much fun - thank you everyone! and I found the cheese this morning - still in the fridge...
Hi Sam I don't see your chicken soup recipe on your site....I would really like to try it.....the cold thing has set in here. Please Help!!!!!!!! Thanks
just noticed these tulips in my kitchen and feel bad for the pink one on the right...why is he so sad?
Didn't brave the meet-n-greet line afterwards last night but my girlfriend and I really enjoyed your humor and inspirational stories. Thanks! No mozzarella.
I bought your cookbook last night for a couple who share a birthday. I hope they are as inspired as I have been!
Sam, do you have any good goose recipes?
Dood I just made that bruschetta you're making on TV (and your tortilla soup) for my wife and daughters for vday! HUGE hit! Thanks...
Hi Sam! I made your chicken noodle soup for my sick boyfriend, he thought I was a genius! bwahaha! Thanks!
Thank you Sam! ...for letting us feel it is okay to go back into our kitchens and not have to shave a truffle, or download something. You rock! :-)
Curse you Sam the Cooking Guy!! I just made your coconut macaroons....ahhhhh!! Heaven on earth! Watch out hips, watch out ass, here comes scrumptiousness!!! (whywhywhywhy did I break down and make them!)
just a reminder - when you're talking cell phone to cell phone, not matter whose side dropped the call - the person who 'originated' the call, calls back. there's no confusion that way...
Made the French Onion Soup, but I kinda eat alot so I added a Roast Beef Sub for a french dip kinda thing. OOOOOHHHHHH MMMMMYYYY GAWD!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks Sam
Sam I LOVE YOUR SHOW I watch it as much as possible! Here's the thing. I'm a vegetarian and I was wondering if you could (even though you love meat) Make a dish (or even EPISODE) for the veggie-sam the cooking guy lovers out there!
here's a thought - maybe lindsay lohan should just marry charlie sheen?
mexican meatloaf. make it tonight, then make meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow - you can thank me later. http://www.thecookingguy.com/cookbook/recipe.php?id=458
I made your Spicy BBQ chicken pizza last night and made your goat cheese stuffed chicken breasts a few weeks ago. I love how good tasting, simple and quick your recipes are. Thank you for sharing! I can't wait to try another one!
a few years back, one of my brothers used still-attached chopsticks to smoked cigarettes - said it kept his fingers from getting stinky. I thought he was odd...until I saw this woman today using a plastic fork. maybe it's more common than I thought. is it? are you one of these people? do you use something?
Hey! I'm having a bowling party for my son and can not find or come up with ANY unique bowling-themed snack suggestions. Any ideas- either the food or creative bowling-ways to serve it? Would LOVE any ideas you might have! Thanks!
why can't I locate the roasted veggie soup from the show last night on the web site? I know it's not rocket science, but I like a visual map of what I'm making!! LOL Carrots, onions, white carrot looking thing, garlic, toms? Roast 450, for 35? blend in blending unit, and add cheese? Ok got it.! 
Hey Sam what was with you making French Onion Soup again??? That's right, I remember when you made it like 5 years ago!!! Probably because it's super tasty!!! Anyways, I hope re-doing recipes doesn't become a habit of yours... Anyways, if you need any recipes (such as my epic pasta carbonara), message me... 
Hey Sam, I made the mexican meatloaf but think I made a mistake. Do you use the chilies in adobo sauce? I tried to find chopped chipotle pepper, found chipotle pepper in the powder form so used the ones in the can...is that correct?
Dear Sam, remember us? We would really love to do a wine tasting/food pairing event with you! Cheers! -Vineagogo
Hey Phoenicians, I'll be cooking at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival April 9th. See u there? http://www.scottsdaleculinaryfestival.org/
Hey Sam, I want to do some healthy but tasty slow cooking dishes with chicken and beef, any suggestions? Thanks! Love your show, wink ;)
Hello Sam, A week or 2 ago I saw you on a show. I did not have audio, but it looked like you made green chile chilaquiles with an egg on top. Where can I find that recipe? Looked on your website, but could not find it. Great show by the way!
My mom used to make liver and onions. It was sooo bad that my dad doused it with ketchup. Very dry and no flavor. But we had to eat what was put in front of us. I did meet a lady years ago who was a very good friend of mine. Her mom owned or owns Pee Wees Soul food downtown. She made liver and onions for me...OMG I could not get enough. I would love to learn how to make this dish..no ketchup required. It was the best I ever had. Please teach me how to make it taste good. Thanks 
Chimichitos! I used taco-size tortillas and made 6 small ones. My fiance was impressed :)

Filet Mignon with Red Wine Sauce The couple that sauts together, stays together! Instead of fighting the crowds at a restaurant on Valentines Day, we stay in and fall in love with two perfectly cooked filet mignon steaks! http://cristyandmichael.blogspot.com/2011/02/filet-mignon-with-red-wine-sauce.html
Here are those delicious two-salsa mini chimichito's I made for dinner the other night. It's always fun to add a twist of imagination to some of your recipes. I am cooking my way through the end of your book ;)
Thanks for the great hospitality at last night's pre-show Meet & Greet...Lucky & Haley were are GREAT addition to the show...Thanks to my sweetheart Suzanne for sending me to the LIVE show...Can't wait for the 3rd cookbook to hit the shelf!!!
Sam's Garlic Bread, fresh from the broiler, before being sliced up and served as a side for tonight's dinner! Natasha, now we know why you and your family like this so much, it's really great!
And tonight's dinner, Sam's Shrimp with Pesto Linguini (note the aforementioned Garlic Bread, now sliced and served as a side); great stuff, and easy too!
Sam, I prepared this a little while back, inspired by a combination of your recipes; from bottom to top: toasted artisan bread, a little hollandaise sauce, spinach leaves, sliced tomato, sliced ham, homemade guacamole, poached eggs, MORE hollandaise sauce, then topped by a sprinkle of salt and pepper. What do you think? It's easier to prepare than it looks! :-)
Joni, my absolute love, adores Italian food.. so when I wanted to prepare something special for her this Valentine's evening, who else did I turn to but Sam and his newsletter. One of his recommendations this month was an Italian combo, Red Pepper Bruschetta and Spicy Sausage Pasta. Easy to prepare and a hit with everyone in the family.. but most importantly, the love of my life thought it was A+ fantastic; thanks Sam!
Tonight's Valentine's dessert: Sam's Ice Cream Sandwich Deal.. the low-fat version, made with "skinny moo" ice-cream sandwiches, chocolate syrup, mint cookies, and powdered sugar, yum! :-)
At the "Sam Live" performance last night, Sam played for us his original "Cooking Guy" demo tape, the one that got him started on TV: in it he showed how to prepare "Rainy Day Salmon." Frankly it's a recipe I've wanted to prepare for some time now but have just not gotten around to it. But seeing how good it looked in the video last night, plus the fact that it's indeed been a rainy day in Southern California today, I figured "what the heck, now's the time to make it!" So here it is, my attempt this evening at Sam the Cooking Guy's first TV recipe, "Rainy Day Salmon." What do you think Sam, does it appear close to your version?? :-) PS: The side dish was "Blue Cheese Mashed Potatoes." One may think initially "salmon and mashed potatoes? That doesn't sound right!" But you might be surprised at how well the two work together!
Tonight I made Sam's "Grilled Caprese Sandwich." It's a Caprese salad made into the form of a grilled cheese sandwich, i.e. with fresh mozzarella cheese (not the usual packaged stuff), fresh basil, and tomato slices. Note the melted mozzarella cheese spilling over the edges after I cut into it, it's the only true way to know that you've used enough! :-)
Been there and done that, but NOT with Girl Scout Thin Mints, that's a great idea Sam!
Sam this is a great recipe (Blueberry Croissant Bread Pudding)
just a little monday night, "el presedente" day dessert, no big deal....
It's Girl Scout Cookie Season...use their Thin Mints to make this most excellent dessert: http://www.thecookingguy.com/cookbook/recipe.php?id=378
manicure - check recipes - check video - check surprise guests - check shoes shined - not checked clothing picked out - not checked know what I'm going to say - not checked sam live! will be great tomorrow, but clearly I still have some things to do...http://www.thecookingguy.com/samlive/
Miss you Sam. Let the games begin. Fork It Over at the KROC Center is getting underway for another beautiful event. Can't hardly wait. It is going to be simply awesome, because of you:)
We had the spinach and red pepper fritatta from the brunch show for Christmas breakfast. Loved it! Thanks, Sam!
Hi Sam... I moved from San Diego to Montana about 4 years ago... I still talk about your show and make dishes I learned watching... and I am NOT a cook!! My favorite is the Gnocchi with Italian sausage and basil... sooo good!!!!
Hi Sam. Heard you talk about your bacon guacamole on The DSC this morning. Sounds delicious but I can't find the recipe on your web site or theirs. I want to make this for my family on Super Bowl Sunday. The only thing they've ever seen me make is Campbell's Bean Soup, so this will really impress them. Could you please post the recipe? Thanks, Goz
Hi Sam-- Looking for a good bean and cheese dip recipe, similar to Garcia's. Can you offer any suggestions?
Now that Fit TV is no more (replaced by Discovery Health) :( have you given any thought to doing DVD boxed theme sets and/or getting your program syndicated on the East Coast or Midwest? Really Sam, you are sooooo much better than 95% of the other "cooking" programs. I'm thinking of that skinny lady with the big chest and huge head? Food Network for you...maybe? I'm just so sad about OWN turning my world upside down. Don't mean to be such a downer but I've enjoyed your shows so much and ...... :-(
Hi Sam! Saw an episode recently with a papaya, English cucumber, jicama salad thing...but now can't find the recipe anywhere....can you help? Sounds very similar to what I take to lunch everyday (I just throw whatever fruits & veggies I got from farmer's market with cucs and olive oil, salt & pepper - delish!). Thanks :-)
made your feta and red pepper pockets for the big game today! My man came up with the idea of sprinkling parmesan on them before baking-a nice addition! Try it! Thanks for the inspiration! You rock!
I miss Just Cook This! Discovery Health is now the Oprah Winfrey Network Fit TV is now Fitness and Health and Just Cook This! is on neither
WIN TICKETS TO SAM LIVE!......just tell me what food you'd like to see me do a show on. I'll pick 3 names from all who post in the next hour and give them a pair of tickets to the event Feb 18th.
Sam, I just put my request on you wall Was the the right place?
a feature on kid lunchbox wraps!
make me some yummy tacos!
Crab or Shrimp.... I love seafood!
Mexican food that won't make us fat. :)
I already posted to win Sam but please pick me! Breakfast pizza! Please pick me Sam! My birthday is on the 17th! I've met u twice while in the Navy but I need more Sam in my life! My hubby didnt buy the tickets in time! :(
Would love to see you do a show on using the uncommon items in a creative way...artichoke heart, heart of palm, asparagus, and working them into a main dish to die for on a budget and short on time.
Hmmm... how about cook one whole chicken and make 5 different meals from Mon-Fri.
banana fish!
Kabobs! Meat, Veggies, Fruit...anything on a skewer!
Pasta with olive oil garlic anchovies red pepper flakes and broccoli
pasta sauce without red tomatos ( i am allergic to them) a great dessert chocolate or citrus.I really could use the help with this one. 
Lots and lots of shrimp...and maybe a lobster too!
Congrats to Matt A for the Spam suggestion, Paige O for the beer pairing idea and Steve B for what to do with scallops (I LOVE scallops). and stay tuned right here until the 18th for more ways to win - and watch San Diego Magazine http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/ for other chances to win
Ok so we're going to SAM LIVE! We even recruited another couple last night to come along. We never knew they were STCG fans. So I have a quick question that anyone can answer, but hopefully Sam will chime in. I'm getting ready to buy some Knives. STAMPED or FORGED? I've read on the internet all about the differences. I still don't know which to get! Sam, or anyone out there have any advice?? Favorites Brands for longevity?
your recipes are pretty darned funny. . . .mashed potato and stuffing tacos - reminds me of stuff I ate while being pregnant, which included anything and everything. 
Please sam, do more Indian or Asian foods. They use spice instead of fat to flavor their foods so its "healthier". I love your style of cooking and hope you can make the mystery of spices easier to utilize. 
you are not on tv anymore in Denver and its KILLING me !!!! damn Oprah
Hey Sam! I just watched the latest episode of your show and I wondered where you got that awesome tea strainer thing that drains straight into the cup? I'd love to get one of those, what are they called?
Hi Sam, Our Romantic Valentines Dinner was your Spinach & Goat Cheese Omelet with a bottle of Champagne! 
Made your asian infused salmon tacos last night for me and my girl. Friggin' awesome stuff man. Cheers.
We have to 2 extra tickets to SAM Live! this Friday that we can't use. Any takers? I think we bought them for $60 each, selling both for $100.00. Message me if you want them. See you there! I can accept credit card payment or check by fax. 
Sam..you made chicken noodle soup on your show the other day. I'm recreating it right now, but I can't remember when to add the veggies, and if you added any spices. Why can't I find the recipe on your website? Help! :(
I ended up with some left over rice and now I can't wait to try your fried rice receipe.
last minute prepping for sam live! friday. I can't wait... http://www.thecookingguy.com/samlive/
I am in great need of your sympathy!! My wife bought me preferred tickets to your show for Christmas, yey!! However, she now wants to go to the show and could only get regular seating. Is there any way I can get her in to the pre-show???? Case of wine perhaps? Trip to a Spa?? As you can see I am really trying to twist your arm!!
We made your ribs (beef instead of pork) for our family valentines day dinner. Nothing better. Best rib recipe EVER!!!!
I would like to try this bread, but I don't eat much. Can I just order 1 loaf? If so where?
P28 is now 100% Natural!!!!! We've done away with the old formula, and have taken the bread to a whole new level. Enjoy the same great nutritional benefits with an even better taste! Check out our 100% Natural Flyer for key benefits and nutritional breakdowns.
When P28 bread will be available in Poland? %)))
Just received my bread in the mail today. I haven't tried it yet, but it came with a high protein bagel, which I just had and it was AMAZING! I toasted it and put a little honey butter on it. I figured this was a good snack since I had a high protein shake about 3 hours ago. I hope the bread tastes just as good because I can't wait to make french toast with this!
Got my order of bread today ....all I can say it was the most amazing bread that I ever tasted...made an eggwhite sandwich and it changed my life thanks P28

Having someone there to push you through will allow you to stay motivated, focused, and help you thrive throughout your entire workout! Remember no short cuts.

Hey i'm looking at purchasing your bread but cant seem to find where to get from in Australia? i went onto bodybuilder.com and tried to order some loafs but then it said that shipping couldn't be made to Australia, so again i'm at a dead end and am desperate to find out where and how i can purchase your product? any information would be appreciated 
just got my bread today and am enjoying it now. Love the new formula!! Thanks for an awesome product!!!
any coupon codes for online ordering about to order 10 loaves
Love this product! We are going to start carrying it in our store next week. Can't wait until the bagels come out next month. To me, this bread is like a steak. I eat one piece and I am full for two to three hours. 
Just got my bread today made a sandwich and packed it for lunch. Met up with my friends and they were all eating bacon sandwiches on White bread. Pulled out my bad boy and sunk my teeth I to it expecting it to taste horrible. This is the best tasting bread ever! I mean normal bread even does not taste this good and it's solid stuff! Delicious product thank youuuuuuuu!!!! Http://www.Mrtlookalike.com
Love the bagel sample! Can't wait until you sell them. Yum! :p
P28 bread is for endurance athletes too. Great job on the new formula guys!
Good luck to Team P28 Fighter Marc Stevens as he fights John Cholish tonight on HDNet/Showtime. Fights begin at 8pm ET. Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Silva. Be sure to tune in and watch Marc battle it out in the octagon!

New Dressings that we launched this year: Fuji Apple Vinaigrette, Cherry Vinaigrette, Greek Vinaigrette, Lite Jalapeno. What's your favorite?
So I just bought a container of Litehouse Caramel Chocolate Dip, and I just notice things like this, but there is a HUGE spelling error on the container. It says, "delcious" instead of "delicious". You might want to have your proofreaders be a bit more meticulous. 
Looking for your freeze dried herbs in my local super markets found some but not all available. I purchased the freeze dried garlic as this will make a fantastic addition to my back country food supplies while out on canoe trips. 
NEW! Every Friday we will talk about one fun food pairing that uses our new Artisan products! Today's is Litehouse Farmstead Feta, Litehouse Artisan Chile Chocolate, Red Pepper, and Mint!
Happy Valentines Day! Anyone making chocolate covered strawberries with our brand new Hard Shell Chocolate dip?

My daughter lives in Houma, Louisiana and whats to find your blue cheese dressing. Can you tell us where she can get it? Thank you!!
just wondering i already put a application in and wanted to know when your going to start hiring in hurrican thanks :)
So lucky to have this dressing local here in Sandpoint ! My daughter (9 yrs old) has epilepsy and requires medicine 3 x a day in a "sprinkle" form. she will only take it with lighthouse blue cheese dressing...! go figure ... she loves it ! 
I love your products, however, I cannot seem to find the good majority of them in my local area, of Chicago, IL. I would like to see more or a variety stocked in my local stores. I really want to try the Honey Mustard, but will have to drive on Michigan to get it. no fair!
Just wondering if you buttermilk ranch dressing taste close to a restaurant style ranch dressing?

I have also seen your burritos in my local stores but I can't eat any of them bc of the dairy (cheese). Have you considered making burritos that are not only gluten free but also dairy free? Maybe you could team up with Daiya and use their cheese to make some delicious new burritos? 
i heard a rumor about you guys making a new pizza wrap product? wish to confirm or deny?? :)

Adobe, can I ask you why, in the 21 Century, you only have support telephone numbers open Monday to Friday? I purchased some software from you, did not receive the email with serial number and cannot contact you until Monday. This is not acceptable!

Is anyone else as pissed off with bloody Adobe as I am? I can't use Mozilla Firefox any more because the update last November didn't work. Now it wants to update its reader and fails, moaning about drive G. It's help offerings might as well be in Klingon for all they mean to me, and they don't offer any sort of individualised support by email, doubtless because they'd be swamped. Frigging Pest of the Year Award!! 
I hate you Adobe! You keep ignoring your softwares bugs and just keep charging full price for half-baked products.
I might as well blog the Awknesses of Adobe. I finally got emails saying my complaints had arrived. I can't reply to the email. Thay want me to log in somewhere. I need to know My Adobe ID. I've never bought anything Adobe, it's just a pest that gets wished upon me with other stuff, I'd never willingly buy anything from Adobe, why should I have an Adobe ID? I create one for the sake of complying with the arrogant Adobe help procedures. Then we come to this ***Create a personal page that lets others know more about you. Upload a photo, link to your blog and share your expertise with the rest of the Adobe community*** Oh it's a dating site is it? Oh I'm part of a COMMUNITY am I? no wonder everything Adobe is so frustrating. They need to know my *address* before they can tell me how to correct the screw up their updates have made of my previously working programs. FFS Adobe - get your act together

Super Bowl weekend: Are you cheering for the green and gold Packers or the black and yellow Steelers?
Just finished painting my dining room in Bee's Wax-- Cashmere flat. I <3 it & am now a fan of flat paint!
Was wondering what Sherwin Williams color you suggest comes closest the Pantone color of the Year...Honeysuckle? thanks!
Happy Valentine's Day! Which of these red and pink hues do you "love"?
We redid our bedroom using Sherwin Williams paint on the walls. I got a lot of amazing compliments on the transformation, from another Facebook group when I posted of my before and after shots . Do you had a makeover contest? I think I would have a shot at winning. :)
Our painter uses SW and we couldn't be any happier, it looks WONDERFUL! Living room was done in "Sand Dollar", accent wall was done with "Rainwashed" & our bedroom will be finished tomorrow with "Earl Gray". I'm so so so happy with Sherwin's products! All our trim is "Pure White" BEAUTIFUL!
Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton all share the same favorite color: blue. Happy President's Day!
When is the next big sale!? I have been waiting for it to paint two rooms in my house. Almost caved and went to Lowes this weekend, but trying to be patient.
Designer Inspiration: This month we're featuring rooms done in stripes shared by six interior designers. Which one inspires you?
If you'd like to put out another coupon, you'd be making one customer very happy. I just missed the last one!

Frank & DK: Jack and Shirley Honeycutt here. We are stuck in Las Vegas (no flights out of Dallas, due to snow and no hotels due to snow and superbowl. So we are stuck here. We will miss your show tomorrow and we are very disappointed. We have given our tickets to "Mr. B." He's a good friend and a bluegrass promoter, has 2 festivals a year in Ladysmith plus other shows. Go say hi to him if you get a chance, we are so sorry we arenot going to be there. Have a great show. P.S. His name is Warren Bauserman.

Hey Frank, are we going to have a chance to download any songs we missed from the valentines special? My band and I would really love to get our hands on every piece of dirty kitchen music that is available!
Just downloaded "Day to day", one of my favorites!
Fantastic show at Ashland Coffe and Tea! Thank you and the Band for some wonderful music!
A performance review by No Depression: "...Frank Solivan and Dirty Kitchen helped me remember why I love bluegrass: the pure adrenaline of lightning-fast picking and wickedly complex arrangements. Alan Lomax famously called bluegrass 'folk music on overdrive' and after Frank Solivan's performance, I'd have to whole-heartedly agree..."

SUSTAIN MAINE Forests make clean water, part 1... Clean water is essential to life & essential to our production operations. The forests of Maine act as giant filters, purifying rainfall & snowmelt, keeping our lakes & rivers naturally clean. Here in Portland, the water source is Sebago Lake, and the rivers that supply the lake receive plentiful clean water from healthy filtering forests. -SteveP

What to cook when you're in a cottage in the Maine woods with no electricity or water to wash dishes? My fianc and I felt like kings eating Barber Stuffed Chicken Breasts and potatoes tossed with olive oil and herbs on paper plates by candlelight. And best of all - because we used our little gas oven with a foil-lined cookie sheet - clean up was a breeze! -Lanelle R.
Valentine's Day is this Monday, and my husband is taking me to Emilitsa here in Portland! This will be my first time there, so I'm excited! I am also tasking myself to make heart shaped Rice Krispie treats for the daycare and a cake for work! What are your plans for this loverly day?? -Dorene M
SUSTAIN MAINE Edible products that we cannot sell are usually donated to local community food banks. Inedible products are sent to a facility where they are composted, eventually becoming rich organic soil. Suspended solids (organics) that are removed from our wastewater are sent to a digester facility where they help produce methane gas, which is burned to produce electricity. -SteveP
My family and I LOVE your stuffed chicken breasts. I have printed all coupons available several months ago and I can't print anymore. Will they ever re-set so that I can print more? Fingers crossed!!!!

b'Alliance Data teamed up with ChildCareGroup\xe2\x80\x99s Anderson Center in Garland for the second time this year, hosting a children\xe2\x80\x99s holiday party to help spread cheer to young children who otherwise may not have the opportunity to experience a magical side of the holiday season. The company\xe2\x80\x99s employees \xe2\x80\x9cadopted\xe2\x80\x9d each of the 120 kids for the holidays and provided them with books, coloring books and crayons to continue fostering a love of reading and learning, highly encouraged by ChildCareGroup. Alliance Data also donated soccer balls and helmets, and volunteers assembled company-donated tricycles and wagons for the kids to play with during recess time at the center.'
b'In a celebration of the company\xe2\x80\x99s core value of giving back, employees from Alliance Data, a Plano-based leading provider of loyalty and marketing solutions, yesterday honored International Corporate Philanthropy Day on February 23 by stepping away from their day jobs to volunteer for Boys & Girls Clubs of Collin County (BGCCC).\n\n"Our corporate sponsors and volunteers, including all the help we get from Alliance Data, are the reason we\xe2\x80\x99re able to continue making the progress in these kids\xe2\x80\x99 lives that we do every year," said Karen Johnson, director of the Boys & Girls Club of Plano. "We have terrific staff here, but with an average of 200 kids to teach and educate every day at this club alone, we can never have too many visits from our Alliance Data volunteers."'
b"Ever heard of International Corporate Philanthropy Day? We had a great time marking the occasion last Wednesday at the Boys & Girls Club in Plano, just north of Dallas. Be sure to check out our photos and videos from the event, and use the 'likes' to let us know what you think!"
b'Wow, just saw an ad for the new Twitter. Looks like some really great changes are on the way! Do you use Twitter? What do you think about these updates?\nhttp://twitter.com/newtwitter?autoplay=true'

Today is the last day to enter our Super Bowl Draw! We are giving away a 37" TV just in time for the big game!
I gave my kids the Kim and Scott's stuffed cinnamon pretzels for breakfast today and they couldn't get enough! Thanks for stocking such great and different items. I do 99% of my shopping here!!!
love this store, when we went to the opening in Fort Worth, our 13 year old son noticed the Bob's salad dressings...we are originally from Cal and really miss the dressings... we were so happy to be able to buy some along with your great produce deals and bulk items. you have a life long customer in the Kay Family
I got my free chocolate bar today. Thanks!
I just found out about your store in our area! I'm on my way!
I forgot to check if you carry tofurkey deli slices at the Fort Worth store, do you?
I wish Sprouts carried pressed tofu (five spice tofu). It's fabulous but I have to go to the Asian market to get it. Not as convenient!
Its no fun to be kept up at night feeling a scratchy, sore throat or pesky sinus congestion coming on. Fortunately there may still be time to boost your immune system and ward off further symptoms. Oregano oil, an herbal supplement sold in capsules or liquid form, can be an excellent early defense mechanism. Squeeze just a few drops into a glass of water or OJ and drink up.
can't pull up your darn weekly ad, trying to access it so I can send my husband to p/u fruit and veggies for me tomorrow so I can make baby food, can't do that if I can't view the current ad, what the heck?
Hi I missed your reusable shopping bag with orange/strawberry pictures on it. I keep looking for them but it seems like they are not in the store any more. Are you going to sell them again?
It seems the cold weather has more people raising their shoulders up in an effort to stay warm, as if they are wearing their shoulders for ear-rings. I have been focusing mostly on shoulders since the snow/ice came to TX. Today, I will be offering chair massage in the Vitamin Dept at the Sprouts in Murphy, TX, from 3 pm - 6 pm. Stop by for some TLC. I will enjoy meeting you.
BREAKING NEWS Sprouts and Henry's are planning to join forces! You may have heard the rumors or read about this online and now, at last, it can be confirmed: were bringing together two branches of the same family tree. Check out our wall for a link to more details.
Do you know anything about Sprouts coming to Fort Worth Ave., in Oakcliff, Dallas Texas? The rumor has gone crazy here, either Whole Food or Sprouts. Just want to clarify. If it's you guys coming to Oak Cliff, Dallas, people here will exclaim with excitement. 
Just drove the 26 mile round trip to Cedar Hill, TX. Great foods, glad that there are some things Sprout's carries that I cannot find anywhere closer. 
How about a store in far north Phoenix (Arizona), such as the Anthem, New River, Desert Hills, Tramonto area??? Bell Road, Tatum area just to far to Drive..
Thank you for carrying Daiya cheese and many other vegan items!! Lots of organic, and gluten-free stuff too which is great! Just discovered your store, <3 it!
You know we're all about saving you some dough... This week, you can save 30% off on all Sprouts label breads. Organic breads, included. We don't stop there, either. May as well take 30% off our sliced deli meats, so you can assemble your favorite sandwiches on the cheap!
love that you had Almonds and Tofu on sale at a great price. Been to Sprouts in Fort Worth, TX 3 times this week.
Thanks to the Sprouts store in Frisco, TX for ordering me a whole case of the Badger lip balm in Orange flavor! I wish they would just carry that flavor all the time, but since they don't, I really appreciate the kind supplements employee helping me out :) Wish I could remember her name. 
Good news that Sprouts and Henry's is merging. Please bring Boars Head cold cuts to Sprouts in Westlake Village, CA. 
Our bakery buyer just brought in a new delicious dessert! It's a 3-in-1, red, white and blue patriotic pie featuring a fruitful fill of cherries, apples and blueberries. It comes open faced or lattice topped. Your choice for $5.99. (We dig the old-fashioned lattice.) How does this look, to you?
i LOVE sprouts but the cashier Erin at your Seal Beach, CA store needs a SERIOUS attitude adjustment. bad bad bad customer service. 
I stopped shopping at Henry's because I love Sprouts. Wider aisles without merchandise stacked to the ceiling (too claustrophobic in my earthquake-prone area). I hope you make the Henry's like Sprouts and not vice-versa.
For those who have a Sprouts Farmers Market near you, one should check it out. There is Whole coffee beans (flavored or reg.) that is better than other brand name coffee's. 
Does anyone know if Sprouts price matches?
hi guys, it is such a treat to shop at Sprouts. I dread going to other stores when I need stuff you just don't carry. I am now looking for dirty salt. I'm surprised it is not available....yet!
Just found out that Sprouts has the Elderberry syrup for sore throats!
I am excited about the new store opening in Redondo Beach, CA! I was hoping you'd get that location. What is the estimated grand opening date? And any chance, since you are Sprouts and produce is your specialty, of setting a precedent with an all-vegan store? That meat/dairy space could be replaced with organic fruits and veggies. :) Thanks!
I love that gift cards are going to be on sale this weekend!
I'm confused and more then just curious about a recent increase in "excessive packaging" for "bulk items" and would like to post a picture of specifically "what I mean" and an answer to the illogical waste (as several folks agree with me on this being a bad move)
I've been hunting all over Austin for Coleman All Natural Hot Dogs. Any chance that you could get them before grilling season?
I just got the call that I'm one of the gift card winners from Sprouts Farmers Market grand opening in Fort Worth! Thank you, thank you, thank you! 
Question...so when you buy pancake mix, rice, etc..how do you know measurements and what to do add to cook it?
Can't stop eating Sprout's Roasted Red Pepper Hummus!! Yuuuuummmmmmmyyyyyyyyyyy
I just took advantage of the 25% off sale on bulk items: brown sugar, green lentils, unsalted Virginia peanuts, walnuts, almonds, dried cranberries, cashews, and, as a treat for myself, dark chocolate covered honey comb. Oh yeah! 
How can Sprouts' decrease the greenhouse gases emitted in AZ? Easy. Recycle it produce waste. Eco Scraps AZ would like to partner with Sprouts' and its waste hauler to keep the produce waste out of AZ landfills and create a product the community may use. Harvest Plenty Compost & Potting Soil is the product @EcoScrapsAZ makes from produce waste.
I'm eating a tasty lunch of peanut butter & jelly on Sprouts organic multi grain bread with a side of Sprouts natural Cheese Curls. YUM.
LOVE my brand new Sprouts store in Fort Worth, TX and all the gluten free goodies there!!!!!
I need help with the whole grain pancake mix, do I just add milk and eggs? Does anyone know how much? 
Valentines Day is around the corner and its the perfect time to pamper your special someone with high quality body care at 25% off.

Such a wonderful lunch, thanks to Sprouts. Delicious sourdough bread smothered with Sprouts hummus and rotisserie chicken inside. Sprinkled a little dried oregano on the hummus for a yummmmy sandwich!
wants all Sprouts fans and employees to know, sooooo...I'm shopping at my local Sprouts, in Richardson, and I'm in the dairy department. Guess who else was there??? Mr. Schepps--as in, Schepps Dairy!!!! No kidding. Of all people! There was a very kind woman shopping with him, and, as we were talking, she told me he just turned 93 recently. 93?!?!?! And he's still out shopping (for his OWN milk, I might add)???? That is so fantastic. And why not? He is, after all, Mr. Schepps. Happy Belated Birthday, Mr. Schepps! Thanks for all the wonderful milk over the years! And Sprouts, thank you for having such a wonderful store that brings people from all walks of life to you!
I would like to say "THANKS" to Sprouts for using existing building to setup the new sprouts locations. . I truly appreciate your business relocationing into vacant space instead of taking up precious land for the new location. I wish more businesses moving to Austin & central Texas would use this same philosophy about recycling existing buildings!!!!! 
I just saw something on TV about an Arizona cheese nicknamed "squeaky cheese"--and they said it is available at SPROUTS--do you carry it?? I don't remember seeing it at the 19th Ave and Glendale location...want to try some!
I'm addicted to the veggies chips that are on special at my Sprouts this week. <3
Dear Sprouts..I'm so glad you came to Fort Worth! Our entire dinner tonight was bought from this location. 1 roasted chicken = $3.99, 1 box of Near East Garlic & Olive Oil Couscous = $1.00, 2 lbs of fresh asparagus = $2.50, 1 carton of fresh blueberries = $1.50. 1 superbly delicious meal and 2 satisfied customers = PRICELESS!! 
Is there an estimated opening date for the Citrus Heights, CA store? We're very excited!
Ever since you guys posted on Facebook about your new "fruit pearls" frozen desserts, I have been dying to try them.... Apparently I'm not the only one - they are entirely cleaned out EVERY time I go. Guess they're a hit :) Please stock more!

For those of you who did not have Chris Reifert's Mummified Jalapeo Bacon Bombs over the weekend, maybe this can help to whet your appetite!
"Assistance may be required; I suggest the help of an extremely attractive metal goddess." Reverend Kriss Hades of Sadistik Exekution passes on a solid piece of advice on how to master his beautiful Black Metal Berry Pie.
Obscurity might be the most... obscure band in the book. Don't let that fact get in the way of you trying out their Rbiff (Swedish Steak Tartare), though. It's just as raw and just as irresistible as their music! 
So, did anybody have Chris Reifert's Mummified Jalapeo Bacon Bombs over the weekend?
Feel like you love beer so much that drinking it doesn't really do it anymore? The answer to your blasphemous prayers is Trench Hell's Beer-Battered Fish Filets with garlic Prawns [p. 156]. Now you can eat your beer! What kind of beer you want with your beer, you have to figure out yourself, though. Also, Trench Hells' Hellhammer sniffing thrash works as the perfect beer guzzling soundtrack!

Pepperoni, Sausage and Mushroom Valentine Pizza http://bridgford.com/consumers/featured_recipes.asp
Bridgford: So big that they can ignore about FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND potential customers? We live in Lancaster, CA in the northern part of Los Angeles County. I had my sister bring me back some Bridgford Bertolino 16-inch Pepperoni sticks from ARIZONA. We have no Bridgeford meat products available in the Antelope Valley... Is there some reason that you ignore the Antelope Valley area consisting of Lancaster, Palmdale, Mojave, Rosamond, Edwards Air Force Base, Green Valley, Lake Hughes, Lake Elizabeth, Lake Los Angeles, California City, Tehachapi, Inyokern, Trona, Ridgecrest/China Lake, Littlerock and Pearblossom? Have you no go-getter sales reps? 
I live in Sherbrooke Quebec and we do not have your frozen dough bread,... when I am in Florida I always buy your frozen bread dough.... so delicious....

Happy Valentine's Day!
In danger of blushing here - we've had so many lovely emails the last few days! Is there something in the air?! A big thank you to everyone who sends us feedback. We post it proudly here: http://bit.ly/gzFF3N
Just tucking into our new Tuscan Chicken Stew made with chianti and packed with lovely Italian flavours. Should be out in time for Easter.
(Quite a dramatic) pic from the Teddington shop fit yesterday! Reports from the frontline are that all is on target for the opening on Friday. And apparently the clock just went up. So the countdown can now be monitored even more closely! Please do pop along on Friday if you're in the area - there will be lots of yummy tasters (and a very excited Angela tweeting away in the corner on www.twitter.com/thecookkitchen).
Try parsnip dauphinnoise, had some yesterday from T***O really made a nice change
Why not stay in this Valentine's?! We're offering 2 off any 2 portions from our range for Special Nights In until 14th of February http://bit.ly/e6YgWT
To celebrate our biggest production year ever, we're doing a big bangers and mash lunch everyday this week for everyone who works so hard in the kitchen. We'll also be proclaiming strange but wonderful statistics to anyone who'll listen. For instance: 'We could travel of the way of the around the world with all the meatballs and sausages we made last year (18,994 miles)'. Fact.
Ok we admit, we were a tad sceptical about Ed's bake-off. He's a very busy man and the Bake-Off Tuesday bar has been raised very high recently! But pleased to say the general consensus is he pulled it out the bag in good COOK fashion with a delicious frozen chocolate cake (like a refrigerator cake, but colder). Good to see our co-founder's still got time-saving culinary tricks up his sleeve.
Make Love Not Supper. Don't fret if you forgot to book a table for Valentine's somewhere fancy pants and overpriced - you can still get 2 off our meals for Special Nights In until Monday. Handmade dishes, made from the finest ingredients, 'cooked' in the comfort of your own home. Sounds romantic...
If you're already running out of ideas to entertain the kids over term, baking some cakes always fills an hour or two. Point them in the direction of this brilliant two-minute cupcake video by our friend Clive and then let them loose in the kitchen. We've also recently discovered that muffins are absurdly easy and virtually impossible to mess up (check out muffinrecipes.co.uk).
We just launched our Remarkable Recipes Competition! We're looking for remarkable recipes from our customers (try not to replicate things on the current COOK menu, although twists on classic dishes are okay). You could win: 200 worth of COOK meals, your recipe made with your name on the packaging and have a sum from each portion sold go to a charity of your choice! Closing date: June 30th
Remember to enter your best recipes into our Remarkable Recipes competition http://bit.ly/f6IbTd Win 200 worth of COOK meals; your recipe put into production and sold with your name on the front; and a sum from each portion sold to the charity of your choice. Exciting stuff no?
Getting some great yummy mummy nominations in already! For those not signed up to our newsletter - it's going to be Mother's Month at COOK in March and we want to give away a nice surprise every day. So please tell us why a mummy you know is so very yummy using this easy peasy form...
We've got lots of new dishes to shout about in February: the new cheese souffl is truly remarkable (a world's first... maybe!) the Lamb Shanks even more delicious than they were previously and poetry has been composed for things of far lesser beauty than our two new Wellingtons: http://bit.ly/e6YgWT
This isn't co-founder Dale knocking up a strange new recipe. He's actually randomly selecting our winning Prima competition postcard. We can now officially announce that Melanie Thomas from Cambridge is the winner of our 100 January survival hamper. Congratulations! PS. Watch this space for more competitions (hint: we'll be announcing one tomorrow!)
Just ordered again through your website, was really impressed by last weeks order :D will be making this my weekly shop, Keep up the good work! <3
Lovely staff in Clifton. Have enjoyed a few things so far. Pork & White Wine, Salmon & Asparagus bake and we are having Chicken Lasagna tonight. My hubby loves your banoffee pie. Will be shopping again when we get back from holiday. Will you be doing any healthier options? :) x
Had my first problem with cook this week :( Turned out one of the items wasn;t in stock yet i was still billed for it, rang you guys up but it has yet to be transferred back. 
A few more facts to throw your way: We could fill 46 London buses with the potatoes we used last year and 59 Mini Metros with all the cheese we grated. And some of us like to don the occasional fancy dress costume in the shape of certain food stuffs (namely Caila, Mark and rumour has it that's Sue as the chicken). Certainly made the celebration lunch very entertaining today.
I had one of your Prawn Karahi curries last night, absolutely fantastic. I'm told they are very healthy as well - an added bonus... Keep up the fine work COOK!
Thanks go out to all of our Fans, Customers, Friends and Guests!!!! The last two weeks have been insanely busy. Thanks for your patience, patronage and support of a Locally owned Business. Hunter Clark
Here it is 3:00am and wide awake! I wish I could shut my racing mind off and get to sleep but I guess I'll just get up and get started.

Watch out for the opening next month! :)
Happy Valentines Day to All! Especially to the our loyal customers!
I was at your focus group last night with Chef Billy. I loved the two sweet potato fries you served. You just cant go wrong with sweet potatoes. The other two, The Jerk & Lemon Pepper, although good, just tasted like potatoes with seasoning, where the SP fries have so much flavor by themselves, adding the seasoning to them enhanced it. 
I love the sweet potato fries.
had leftover london broil on french baguette with melted provolone cheese on top, but the best part was the POTATO BITES with 3 cheeses.......felt like we should have been eating out!!!! will DEFINITELY keep them on hand!!
Your sweet potato fries are awesome. Don't like anything spicy, so I stick with the regular flavor. They go with EVERYTHING! Even scrambled eggs! I Love, Love,Love them! 
I really love the sweet potato fries. Sometime I put a batch in the oven and munch on them for a snack.
Just cast my vote for parmesan fries, but didn't get the promised coupon! My printer is spitting out blank pages. Please email me for a regular email address where you can send the promised coupon. Very irritating, although I'm sure an unintended glitch.
Thanks Alexia for a soy-free french fry! Those of us with allergies appreciate that little detail!
Oh my god I love your onion rings! Satisfying and not greasy.
Were happy to announce were working with renowned chef Tyler Florence to create some delicious new recipes that pair perfectly with Alexia products! Click here to see them: http://www.facebook.com/alexiafoods?v=app_7146470109
I've got some of your olive oil potatoes in the oven right now! Yummy!
Love your onion rings - yum.
Love your soy free fries! But we really miss the tater tots. The local grocery store and Target have stopped selling them : (
When are the Alexia sweet potato puffs going to appear in stores like Earthfare in Johnson City, Tennessee?
we LOVE your Roasted Red Potatoes & Harvest Vegetables, but feel so ripped off on what we get. sometimes the bag is ok, but other times (like last nights), there were literally 6 green beans in it and 5 potato chunks and sparse carrots. there was mostly onion and air in the bag. i end up cutting up my own carrots and adding green beans, which kind of defeats the purpose of quick and easy (and pricey) 
Vote now at the "Coupon" tab here on Facebook to "Reinvent a Classic with Alexia!"
My coupon wouldn't print...it just sat there and now it's gone from the page. :(
Lemon Parmesan does not sound that good, so come on people vote Carolina Sweet BBQ and Sweet Potato Waffle!!
Love the sweet potato fries.
Were live with Tyler Florence on the set of his satellite media tour for Alexia Foods!
Be sure to vote to Reinvent a Classic with Alexia because Tyler Florence will be creating a recipe to pair with the winning flavor!
I'm in Round Rock, TX (Austin Metro area) and have been looking for your spicy sweet potato fries. I've gone to 2 HEB's and the local Wal-Mart and Target multiple times...no luck...they're ALWAYS out. Please help. The regular sw potato fries are good, but I really want to try the spicy ones! HELP!
Oh my gosh I am addicted to your sweet potato julienne fries with a little bit of garlic sea salt sprinkled on them and baked on parchment paper!!!! YUM, like candy.
Just a suggestion for Alexia Onion Rings....tried them recently.....when baked they are too dry and the panko coating has no flavor. When fried in oil, the onion rings have a much better texture and taste. My suggestion is to experiment and test another coating such as a batter instead of a breading. I make a beer batter for onion rings, deep fry in canola oil. I will experiment myself and freeze some to see how well they re-heat in a hot oven.
Is there any chance that we will be able to see sweet potato hash browns in the near future for those of us diabetics who can't eat regular potatoes and miss these for breakfast?
Do you celebrate Valentines Day with a home-cooked meal or a night out on the town?

Will you guys ever be stocking at Winco?
I bought the sweet potato fries. They are delicious.
Do you sell the onion rings that are crunchy and sold in the chip aisle? Those are our favorite, but cant find them anywhere anymore. Please help!
I love sweet potato fries I make my own with garlic powder and chili seasons!
Your onion rings are awesome! My supermarket had them and now doesn't!
Garlic Fries.. Yumm!!
Stocked up on Alexia at Whole Foods yesterday - ever thought about giving away a lifetime supply? :)))
Bought 2 boxes of the beer battered cheese snacks today. I was disappointed when after cooking them according to directions, the cheese "leaked" out and is like cement on my baking sheet. :/ 
What happened to the Alexia Crunchy Snack line of Waffle Fries? The Classic Ranch and Aged Cheddar Cheese are my absolute favorite! I have been looking everywhere for them! Please let me know :-)
I'm sitting here eating your spicy sweet potato french fries and they are soooo good!

Havent been in a Little Chef for awhile and likely to be popping in for Breakfast on Sunday on way to Southampton. The only problem is no matter were I look the website doesnt say what time Little Chef in Popham opens. Please Help!!

Weve been reminiscing here at HQ about those really naff and irritating British records that you love to hate like the Birdie Song, Agadoo by Black Lace and Lets Get Ready to Rumble by PJ & Duncan. Whats your guilty pleasure?
I visited a Little Chef on the way back from Plymouth to Somerset and it was absolutely disgusting. From the staff, the toilets and to the very cold seating area :( I ordered the pancakes as I used to really love these...but it soured my memories... well as the old saying goes....don't revisit bad memories...so this is one little chef I won't be visiting again.

Hey Gleeks! We had a special guest for our video taping today. Here he is with me and the film crew. More to come, stay tuned.
Meagin was very helpful in trying to sort my order out.
Meagin was fantastic! What a help!
Meagin is fantastic !!! always give a excelent service !! ... 
James Stewart was great in helping me with my shipping problems and providing great customer service. I really appreciate it! This is a great company to buy from!
I just have to say that Shannon in the customer service department is a total delight (and may I say a real life saver as well). My fiancee and I ordered a large quantity of products for our wedding. After we received them and checked them out we realized that the quality of the items would not let them be good enough to actually use them at our wedding. So we reached out to Shannon and first of all she was more apologetic then anything. I guess they have so many different products that is hard for them to see everything they sell. But they do back up their customers. They went to bat for us and we we able to return everything and get a full refund as well. Thank you WEBstaurant Store understanding and taking a bunch of stress off of our wedding day.
Sarah thanks for your support
Sandwich prep refrigerators, industry BEST price, and Free Shipping! You won't see this at #NAFEM-- http://ow.ly/3UVsm
Meagin, thank you for being on top of everything, hope we can place our next full $50K order with you. I'll forward my invoice to you in few days. ES
Sarah in online chat customer service is wonderful! She quickly and easily walked me through a little issue. I placed my order and couldn't be happier with the process. Thanks WEBstaurant and Sarah!
you guys are the best! fast service, good prices, great people. I cant say enough good about you
I had a problem with my order and Meagin solved it!!!!!! Thanks Meagin
I just spoke with Emily using the customer service Chat and she was AMAZINGLY helpful!!! I wish ALL companies had such great customer service!!! :)
I'm a Culinary Arts and Foodservice Management major at Johnson & Wales University; love the prices! 
I would like to personally thank Emily and the rest of the customer support staff for their amazing customer service..what a pleasure!!! So refreshing!!!
Joe G helped me to find the PERFECT little dishes to use for salt sampling... thanks for your help, and I look forward to finding more accessories for my spice business!
Just received great service from Christina on a live chat! Thanks so much!
Christina has been very helpful answering questions, but I would like to know if someone has personally used the 12x12x5 window cake boxes by southern Champion. PLEASE LET ME KNOW
Thank you for the great customer support Leslie! 
Cristina Yesberger was so quick to answer a question that I had about one of your products today, only a few minutes after asking the question I had an answer back to my e-mail! Thank you and I will be doing business with this company.
Christine is the Team Leader of the Axis of Enlightenment, one of our customer service teams (yes, our CS teams have funny names). This is her first post on our blog, and she details how to find the items that are tough to find! http://bit.ly/hHvfng
Juliana was so helpful and kind to answer several of my questions while chatting; I often look for items I can use to decorate for church events. Juliana, you just help create a romantic ambiance for this Friday night - FedEx - Friday Night Date Experience at Carmel Baptist Church in Charlotte, NC! You're awesome!
I own & operate Joanne's Gluten Free Goodies, I supply Health Food Stores in Albany, NY.. Your plastic containers are great for packaging my baked goods. Reasonably priced and very sturdy!
When is the drawling 
I recently placed my first order with WEBstaurant and immediately after finishing the process I noticed some serving spoons that I liked much better than ones I had just ordered. Being fairly late in the evening chat assistance was not available. Skeptically I sent an email explaining what happened and asked if it were possible to alter my order before it shipped. Wow! Bright and early the next morning I had an email response from Emily informing me that she had placed my order on hold and to contact her with the desired changes. A couple of quick email exchanges later I had everything changed just the way I wanted. I never thought that quality customer service could be provided in an electronic format but Emily made the entire process very simple. Quality products can be purchased anywhere. Quality service is more difficult to find. It's the service that will keep me coming back. Thanks so much Emily!
I would like to thank Lisa Stoltzfus for all your help, very nice customer service support. Congratulations all the staff:)
I just talked to Katie on the phone about ordering flatware, very helpful. I'm looking at buying flatware for our Catholic school to use for our big Auction-Dinner fundraiser,wish helps pay expenses at our school. Thank you, WEBstaurant and Katie for sending me an example of the flatware and looking forward to doing business with you. 
Whats up! I go to Johnson and Wales University for baking and Pastry Arts! 
Just completed my first order with Webstaurant store. It was an easy process due to the helpful chat and email communication. One small problem was handled by Katie very quickly. Will be back with another order soon.

I know sometimes it seems like 90% of the desserts written or photographed on the Web are cupcakes (and the other 10% contain bacon), but what Jenn does at JustJennDesigns is just to fun not to share. Walking Dead Cupcakes. Jenn does a lot of killer Star Wars recipes, too. 
The most famous local dish is fish chowder served with a splash of sherry pepper sauce. Native seafoods include conch, rockfish, guinea chick (shiny lobster), red snapper, and yellowtail, with a Sunday breakfast tradition of codfish and potatoes, which are served with red sauce, avocado, and banana. Conch ("konk") is a large type of ocean mollusk that was firm, white, peach-fringed meat. Served fresh, uncooked or deep fried is delicious.
The Atlantis is a large resort with Las Vegas upscale casinos, located on Paradise Island in Nassau, Bahamas.

This immense 423-room tower rests between two white sand beaches on a narrow peninsula, the property offers spectacular ocean vies from every room.
There is a saying. "That which does not kill us makes us stronger." After four years in the making of this Travel Guide, and two years soliciting agents, publishers and recently the cruise line industry, plan D is now put into full action. This book is on the homestretch of its journey. Details will come next. Let's chill and have a Virgin Sangria. Recipe from Spain is in the book.
Nassau, Bahamas: Aquaadventure is a Mayan-themed, Disneyesque water actraction. A 63-acre, 200-million-gallon waterscape, combining slides, lazy rivers, and rapids into one large, natural setting. The centerpiece of attraction is the Power Tower, which contains four waterslides and rock-climbing wall. In addition, walk through underwater tunnels and experience up-close views of more than 50,000 marine life animals.
A typical Bahamian meal consists of crab and rice, steamed fish, served with baked macaroni and cheese and potato salad. This is followed by desserts such as coconut or pineapple tart, bread pudding or guava duff, a dessert that is made through a laborious process of folding the fruit into the dough, boiling and served with a sauce. The meal is topped off with a large glass of ice cold switcha (water mixture of lemon and sugar) or beer.

The earliest evidence of the use of spice by humans was around 50,000 B.C. The spice trade developed throughout the Middle East in around 2000 BC with cinnamon and pepper, and in East Asia (Korea,China) with herbs and pepper. The Egyptians used herbs for embalming and their need for exotic herbs helped stimulate world trade... By 1000 BC China, Korea and India had a medical system based upon herbs.
Thanks everyone for your kind words and concern. We have luckily escaped unharmed. If you would like to support the rescue and recovery efforts, here are a couple of useful links... http://www.redcross.org.au/default.asp

Live from the windowsill: tropical sweet potato pie with brazil nut crumble
I just emailed this comment to the Food Network, if you agree with me, please do the same! Dear Food Network, The number of people leaning toward a plant-based diet is rising all the time. What about a fun, informative, and creative show to highlight this new way of eating - an amazing cooking show featuring a different renowned vegan chef in each episode! The show would be innovative and cutting edge, keeping in trend with the food/health revolution that is taking place in our nation. Vegan most certainly does NOT mean boring! Some ideas: Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, Tal Ronnen - Conscious Cook, Dave Anderson of Madeleine Bistro, Ann Gentry of Real Food Daily, Eric Tucker of Millenium, Tanya Petrovna of Native Foods, Jenny and Heather Goldberg of SporkFoods, Rod Rotundi of Leaf Organics, Robin Roberston, Donna Klein, Isa Chandra Moskowitz, Terri Hope Romero, Mark Reinfeld of Vegan Fusion Cuisine, Dreena Burton... and that's just getting started! Sincerely, Jasmine Hall
hey terry. i'm making the cuban sandwiches and i'm wondering about the bread. whole foods has these approx. 4"x6"x1" "ready to grill focaccia" rolls that i was going to use. do you think they'll hold up being only an inch or so thick? use something else?
Coconut Tres Leches Cake from Viva Vegan!
Hi Terry, I love your cookbooks! Though officially I can't call myself a vegan, I find myself leaning more towards vegan recipes because "vegetarian" seems to be synonymous with "eggs and cheese." So the vegetablephilia of Veganomicon was pretty much the best thing ever. I was wondering if you are still looking for testers?

We need more than one Popeyes in this area! Fortunately, it is worth the 20 minute trip to the other side of town to get to your chicken. I must say Popeyes still has very good food!!
POPEYES CHICKEN!!!!!
Warm up your heart from the cold chills in Canada at our newest location at #106D Woodside Square, 1571 Sandhurst Circle, Toronto, ON.

Your chicken just melted my face off!
Hey Yummie Popeyes When are you guys going to open up Down Under in Sydney Australia? We are in Dire Straits for Popeyes and Please Don't Change a Thing with the menu, just open up in Sydney!!!! 
Not sure who handles this matters but the store at: Popeyes 6502 Antelope Road Citrus Heights, CA 95621 Last night, everything was luke warm to cold. I let the crew know. Don't know if they cared. This store has everything cold/warm more then hot. Last night one breast that was ordered was over done and dry. Fries were luke warm. Biscuits hard and crumbly. The best store yet is Stockton Blvd.. Everything is always fresh and hot. Why aren't all stores the same? Individually owned? Thank you. Tom 
What are you looking forward to most about President's Day weekend - three days off or the sales?
Bad Service.... Went to Popeyes located at 505 N Harvey Mitchell Pky, Bryan, TX. Pulled up to the drive thru where I was the only car in line. I was promptly welcomed and asked if I could wait a minute. After waiting over 5 minutes and no one coming back I pulled up to the pick up window where I still got no ones attention. After an additional 5 minutes I just left and went for Chinese carry out. This store has got to be one of the worst stores you have. This is not the first time we've had problems here.
I took a bus on my way home, (5 mins from the nearest popeyes),then coz it smells really really delicious, i grab a piece of Popeyes chicken. Then when i got home, there was nothing left for my family! My brother was really pissed off that i have to go back to buy some more... LOL!... I love popeyes..cant wait to have my dinner! :)
Tried Popeyes for the first time today, at the Farragut/Knoxville, TN location. I was a little wary at first, because I've been disappointed at travel stations before. But man, I was pleasantly surprised! Great food, great service. I hadn't even gotten the chance to fill up my sweet tea before my food was up! Definitely worth the drive for some of the best chicken in memory!
I LOVE UR CHICKEN STRIPS!!!!!!!! (MILD)
Mmm,nuthin_like_it!spicy_good!
Went to Popeyes on 7th in Renton. Seriously, the nicest people ever. It is my birthday and I haven't eaten at Popeyes since 1998... Totally worth the 45 minute drive. The crew even sang me Happy Birthday, which was a pleasant surprise. We all had a good laugh. 
Love the fried chicken. Need to expand to more locations in Knoxville, TN
we need 1 in johnson city or kingsport tn soon...
We need a Popeyes in the Sycamore/Dekalb IL area!!! We only have KFC and they are serving chicken the size of cornish hens.
Popeyes has some good chicken but the location on Lake Conroe in Texas has the WORST customer service! Rude, rude people and they never get the orders correct!! 
Luv me some popeyes fried chicken an red beans an rice wit a couple biscuits!
Come to sterling CO
love that chicken from Popeyes. hhhmmmmm yeaaaahhh
OPEN ONE N SAGINAW,MI PLEASE...........
Popeyes have the best chicken
 So needless to say I bit the bullet & went to the one in Calumet City as I was out that way. Pulled up to drivethrough, asked for the 2.99 special & if I could have 2 legs, which going there they always charged extra If you wanted something Different. The lady was very Polite & said NO Problem . What ?? Pulled up there & she was very friendly & Smiling The whole time.. So Im Glad That The Customer Service Improved So I Dont have to Grit My Teeth everytime I Go by there & i can actually go there again, with no hassles Thank you server No. 6 ( on the receipt) I Will go there again. thanks Popeyes 
I Just wanted to say im glad You have better customer service at the popeyes in Calumet City On stateline & sibley St. Store No. 5789 I went there a couple times before , just to be rudely treated, I left emails to customer service on your website & never got a response. So I just avoided that popeyes, rather go 10 miles out of my way ,actutally its only about 5 Miles, to the one in Hammond,Indiana on Indianapolis Blvd. Where they never give you any hassle when you want specific chicken. Plus they are very nice & treat your with respect and a smile.
So glad it's here in Raleigh, NC ...now don't have to get my sister in Hampton to bring me some...
Popeyes chicken is Fukn awesome.....yeah
Had lunch at the Pelham, AL Popeyes today. It was awesome as usual! People are friendly, service is fast and food first class. Y'all rock!
Here's my million dollar idea that i'll give to you for free: A Popeye's in Moscow, ID! But it might actually work pretty well... key to success: Be open late and have a walk-up window. Right now there's a bagel shop in town that gets beaucoup dollars, since they're the only ones in town open when the bars close. Do it. Dooo it!
mmmmmmmmmmmmm popeyes chicken fu**ing awesome
besttt popcorn chicken, chicken and biscuits. you guys should add tacoss 
Popeyes...why did you just do me so wrong? I worked a 12 hour day, got off work, too tired to cook, pick up dinner for myself and my spouse...wait 10 minutes, get my food, get back home, open the boxes...and instead of my dinner? You gave me a BOX OF BISCUITS. Now my spouse is driving all the way back with said box of biscuits to try to get his food, and now by the time he gets home his will be cold. You made me sad tonight, and after I had JUST posted that Popeyes was the greatest gift ever given to mankind. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?
Popeye's date nights always work for me!
Eating me some COLD Popeye's chicken and it is as yummy cold as it was hot when I bought it in NY. YUMMY! Someone needs to put a Popeye's in Vermont near me. lol

I have been eating Popeyes in new york for the last few years, and very addicted to it. But the Popeyes in singapore, is obviously a slight change in recipe. I understand that because of the cost, the Singapore franchisee Popeyes cannot import every single spices, used in Popeyes fried chicken, from the States. And you have to skip using certain spices, due to the cost. And also the "CAJUN HOT SAUCE" that the States had been using, is not being served in Singapore Popeyes. Please do not change the taste of Singapore Popeyes too much. In SIngapore Popeyes, we are missing a lot in the original taste of Popeyes Fried Chicken

Jesse, every time I listen to Virtue, I feel it's played by god, so divine!!
What a great show you did in Chatham last night. Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you!
Hey Jesse! Came from Sarnia to see your Chatham show with my Mom. You and everyone were great as usual! Neato bass + Bad ass percussion + Beautiful violining +Insane guitar skills = EPIC PWNING WIN! 
Had a great time @ your show last night in Chatham, brought my Mom and her freinds for NC they are hooked! 
Amazing show in Brantford last night! Come back soon!
Your show was amazing last night at the Sanderson's Center!! It was our anniversary and we couldn't have celebrated a better way. Thanks for getting everyone up and dancing. We've danced to your music since we got together, while making dinner or just with the kids around. Your sound is MAGIC!! Can't wait to see you again. 
Thank you for making tonight another amazing Jesse Cook memory in Guelph. You, your band and your wife were spectacular as always. You also put the most wonderful smile on a little girls face with your kindness and she will skate with even more grace and charm having met you. Thank you again ! 
Absolutely brilliant show in Guelph last night :) Thank-you for making me smile the entire evening with your amazing talent!
Thank you very much Jesse Cook and band for a wonderful and amazing performance last night in Guelph. I absolutely love your music. Your performances make you feel right at home. What I most admire about you is the way you allow every member of your group to shine and you appreciate their creativity and talents. Keep up the good work!
Jesse the show in Oakville Friday night was the best ever! I have been a fan of yours since the Vertigo album...first saw you live on a Triple bill with Amy Sky and Bruce Guthro at Hamilton Place and I was hooked...been to many venues and shows since then thank you so much for your band and music! You also sang Fragile with my friend Chris Mei on the Oakville stage... I was mentioning this to Ronnie on Friday night...it was an off the chart night also my brother's birthday week so we had a huge celebration and your show made it all the sweeter! Look forward to seeing you again soon! :)
Hi! I finally got the photos of your last concert in Ottawa and Valleyfield Quebec and will be sent to you soon as soon as my little drummer can install them, xoxo Graciela Cuellar, "Great Minds Work Together"
Amazing Concert in Guelph (as expected!) Glad we are close enough (MI) to be able to see you again - you and your band are unbelievably talented. We had an awesome time :-) Thank you !
Fantastic time at The Rose Theatre - the Acoustic version of Fall at Your Feet was brilliant. thanks for a great time
Jesse please help! The last time you played in Markham, I was so impressed with your violin player I bought his album (pretty sure it is called Jacks' not here - but I took it out of the case, so I don't have the artist's name...etc) When I saw you in Guelph the other night, I bought Chris' 2nd CD and then realized he is not the performer from the one I have (but great just the same!!!) Whose CD do I have???? please let me know!!!!
i totally loved the show iin brampton have you ever thought of jamming with carlos santana . i bet the two of you would be an amazing combo ,with your acoustics and carlo`s electric all tied together with the amazing percussion that the both of you are into so much and that wonderful violin. did you ever play a coffee house in toronto on the corner of avenue rd and davenport or on college and major back in the late 80`s , ever thought of doing a childrens concert with the kids doing the percussion?? a kind of workshop. or a bbunch of kids in a video like the pied piper walking thru the streets of some latin coountry? i can produce a video if you want. thanks again for a very enjoyable evening
For those of you heading to the show at the Iron Horse tonight, enjoy the show and please share your photos and videos with us. ;D ~Lila
I just love everything you do Mr. Cook :)
Just saw Jesse at the Iron Horse - Awesome Concert - all heart and fantastic music.....dancing all the way home
Just got back from Iron Horse in northampton. What a great show, been a music fan since 1964. What a great band. Hope to catch another show again. Thank you for coming to Ma.
Just got home from the Northampton show - thank you Jesse for an amazing evening! What a privilege to see you and the band in a club setting - the music was fantastic, your stories funny, and you were so gracious to meet with us fans after the show. You definitely make this world a more joyful place to live in!
Jesse, it was a blessing to see you in concert at Guelph on Feb 19, since I just returned from living in Colombia for 2 years. A friend of mine worked in Sincelejo, close to San Jacinto. Interesting connections! Bogota by bus brought back memories of 24/7 vallenato radio (!), the perseverance of the Colombian people and their humour in the midst of often daily struggles. Maybe I just missed it but I'd appreciate reading some reflections from Colombia! gracias por el concierto tan agradable y el amor por la musica que compartes con tu audiencia, Miriam Papps
just want to say Thankyou to Jesse and the band for a great time last night at the Iron Horse! thanks for lighting a fire to get me thru the rest of this winter!!
So far, from watching the videos that you guys have posted from last nighs's show at the Iron Horse, I think those attending the show tonight in Somervile will be in for a treat!:D Lots of laughs and good music. A great combo. Thanks everyone for sharing and hope you will continue to share. ~Lila
I meant to ask last night but didn't get the chance... what is the brand of Jesse's guitar (the one he played last night)? Thanks!!
Bay Shore Rumba Party was fantastic. Three generations dancing in the aisles!
Happy Valentines Day! :D ~Lila
"I have always felt a strong sense of pride regarding the level of musical talent which flows out of a Canada year after year. And it is because of that pride that I am thrilled to be counted among the Canadian musicians who have been nominated for this year's Juno Awards." --- Jesse Cook in response to his 2011 Juno Award nomination for The Rumba Foundation album in the World Music album of the year category.
Congrats Jesse on the Juno nomination of The Rumba Foundation for World Music Album of the Year! So excited for you guys!
Very impressive talent and a handsome artist.
Dear Jesse and band and roties etc. I have photographs of you and I the last performance in Valleyfield, Quebec I'm trying to get loaded into the computer for you, it's the third time I met you in person and you remember me and my son the drummer, too awesome. The next I'll be wearing a blue evening dress, and no, I won't embarass you, only the hightest, respect. Great fan, Graciela Cuellar "Great Minds Work Together"
Jesse. When we were walking to the concert in Kingston on Friday night, the snow was coming down through the street lights and it was just magical to experience.

Is cheddars open today?
Hello, I heard you might be building one in Gainesville, GA in the McEvers Corners shopping center and was wondering if there was any truth to this? Gainesville would be much closer for my elderly relatives who just love your restaurant.
I've only been to Cheddar's once, and that was the one in Overland Park, KS. I've never been so sick in my life..must have been bad shrimp. Will definitely think twice before going to another Cheddars, even though the one in Independence is soon to open, and is going to be really close.
I just was on the Cheddars main website yesterday. What happened to it? It's like missing almost everything!!
I just called Cheddar's in Independence and they are opening at 11am today! 
Well I love Cheddar's food but my last two visits left a bad taste. 1 st I visited the OP location where we had to wait over 2 hours to be seated only to be told they were waiting for the previous party, who wers done eating, to get up and leave. Next we visited ths newly opened Independence location to be encounter impressive drinks and a bartend
OH MY GOD I LOVE CHEDDAR'S !!!!!
I had Cheddars for the first time in Austin, TX. It quickly became our favorite restaurant. I am SO EXCITED to have a cheddars right here in my home town! YAY!!!!
When can I expect to have a Cheddar's close to me in UT? Anywhere in the greater Salt Lake area would be great!
we are at the cheddars tulsa location and are very dissapointed in the general manager bill
Cheddar's Longview Texas. Yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cheddars is "the" best resteraunt in Valdosta,................"HANDS DOWN"
I love the Cheddar's in West Monroe, LA. We have been several times and the food has always been great and so had the service until today. We were part of a party of 12 and I know that is going to slow service down, but this guy would just completely forget what we had asked him for and we all ran out of tea several times. It was by far the worst service I have had there and ofcourse he got a huge tip since it was included in our bill. He definitely did not deserve the amount he got!
Just ate at Indep Cheddar's had a wonderful dinner with my husband. Half the wait we were told and the food was Great!
Just came home from taking the wife out to tne new cheddar's in independence mo Food and service was excellent! Wait time was shorter than estimated. Will defiantly return!! Stanley did a very good job of serving us!
the new cheddars in baytown tx is great, the food is wonderful and the wait staff are friendlyl....also they have really good coffee....
I visited your independence restaurant with 2 of my good friends because I had visited your Springfield location. It was the worst experience of my life. It ended with me being hit and pushed by the General Manager. I walked in to put my name on the list for 4 adults and 2 children with highchairs and they tried to give me a 4 person table, I guess that children dont count as people. I directly asked the worker who I later discovered was the GM to have a place for each highchair to go just as if they were people and I didnt care we how long we had to wait. We were then told very rudely that the wait would be 45 minutes. After waiting an hour we were seated at a 6 person booth and were told we needed to seat our 12 and 18 month child at the end of the booth. 
After being treated horribly again we decided to let it go, again. We then placed our order and after waiting an hour our food came or should I say some of our food. One order was never put in. So we patiently waited for that also. It was the New Orleans pasta and someone else at the table had ordered that also so we could compare. The late order had nothing but pasta, runny sauce, and shrimp. We then asked for the manager to address the long wait for our food, all we wanted to do was address what had happened and get his food remade. After this it was out of control. I never raised my voice to your manager, cursed, or called her any names. There was absolutely no reason for her to walk away from me 3 times while I was trying to inform her of the issues. All I wanted was an Im sorry maam let me take care of that for you. When I said to her that all I wanted her to do was apologize she said Ive done nothing wrong.
When I said our food took an hour to come she directly called me a liar then brought me a receipt with some made up times on it. Like I was a criminal trying to rob Cheddars. We never wanted a free meal we just wanted to voice our concerns. But I guess youre your vow to quality service doesnt consist of the costumers wishes. She also stated several times throughout the evening that she didnt get paid enough to deal with this. I then said that we were not going to pay unless she would finish the conversation with me but she walked away saying she would call the police then. The final conversation with her consisted of her throwing her hands around hitting me and swinging her hand in my boyfriend face, who was holding my 18 month old daughter. This is when she pushed me very hard to get past me. I need to add that behind her was completely open it was not as if she was trapped.
I then asked her to listen to me and give me my options because I was not going to pay to be treated horribly. She snatched the recipient from my hand crumbled it up and threw then told me to get out and never come back. She then repeated this phrase 3 times yelling louder each time. Please contact me and let me know what actions were taken for this serious issue. Also I was curious if there are surveillance cameras in your restaurants to show when she assaulted me. If so I would like this footage. 
A new Cheddar's has opened close to us.....Looking forward to going there!
I recently started going to Cheddars in Fort Wayne and just love it!!...great food and service...my only complaint is that there is no nutrition or calorie information available for any of their items....as delicious as everything is, it has to be loaded with calories!!...LOL.....HIGHLY recommend the Fort Wayne, Indiana restaurant!!
Just ate at the Cheddar's in Huntsville, AL. It was the worst dining experience I have had to date. The service was horrible, I can not BELIEVE that management would hire such horrible servers. 
I wish there was a place to look up nutritional information before I go there. I would prefer to not make a big deal out of it all by asking the waiter while I'm trying to order. Is there a link somewhere online? The website link isn't even up and running at this time. 
ive eaten at the morgantown cheddars twice and it has been one of the best places to eat that i can remember. wish we had one closer to home
Ok...I posted a message on the FB page and I submitted my complaint on the Cheddars contact us email page and still no response to the service I received....does the service I received on Saturday night not worth Cheddars time? 
Just ate at the Independence MO location for the first time, and I have to say the interior beats the Overland Park KS location by far.
When will we be able to buy gift cards online. I really wanted to get one for my daughter in laws birthday. I'm in Colorado with no Cheddars around us, so its not an option for me to visit a restaurant to get one. Really wanted her and my son to try it out.
hi. do you have a kids menu and do kids get crayons or other fun plaything? My nephew only eats chicken nuggets it appears. or pepperoni pizza.
We just ate at the Cheddar's in Valdosta GA and it was great. Service was good and the food was really good too. We will be back there again.
40 minute wait on monster cookie? Seriously? Think I'll stick to the Alcoa, TN location from here on out.
We have never had bad service in the el paso tx location!! we at least go 3 times a week especially for the margaritas! but after tonight i'll be thinking twice! took forever to get a dam table and the service was horrible!!! took a good twenty minutes to be askd what we want for drinks then took another twenty min to bring them out and they were all wrong!!!!! ribs were oveR cooked we didnt get refills and it took us saying we were leaving for them to hurry up on the dam check which were wrong man what a disaster 
Hey is there a Cheddar's in the plans for Clarksville, TN?? I know a lot of people have been talkinga bout it, and it would be a great place for you all to place a restaurant. We are very conveniently located and everyone that goes now has to drive to Hendersonville or Smyrna. :( BRING ONE TO CLARKSVILLE PLEASSSEEE!! :) 
Independence, MO Cheddar's opened today! We can't wait to meet all of our new fans!
Happy Valentine's Day to our Cheddar's Fans! Stop in and share a toast with your sweetheart: Try our Ultimate Cosmo or Cheddar's Bellini, both of which are sure to appeal to that love in your life!

Chevrons Response to the Deepwater Drilling Permit Issued in the U.S.
I can't believe Chevron was just found guilty of $8 billion dollars of damage to Ecuador's rainforest! Why do they exaggerate the damage that oil spills do to a rainforest??!
After thirty years of polluting, arbitrating, and obscuring the truth over the mess Chevron left in the Amazon, the Ecuadorian courts have issued one of their most important verdicts ever: Chevron must pay to clean up millions of gallons of crude oil and toxic mud they spilled in Ecuador. Now, Chevron says it "has no assets in Ecuador and believes it is unlikely ever to pay." Shame on you. Who is 'giving back to local communities now'?
The world needs all the energy we can develop, in every potential form. While finding new ways to maximize the use of traditional resources such as oil and natural gas, we also depend on technology to produce emerging sources of energy. Here are some images of energy technologies employed at Chevron. 
Good day I am Colombian, I am technical in specialist industrial processes and methods and times, I have EXPERIENCE in the oil sector currently working with Ecopetrol but would be part of your team.
That's funny, I was just reading where U were sued for ruining the rain forest.

Wishing for springtime and for the Farmer's Market to open.
@sfm, my daughters and i are thinking of setting up this summer. we want to follow "protocol". we will have mainly fruits and veggies. do most folks sell by the container or by the pound. we don't want to try to undersell everyone else, and we also don't want to price ourselves out of the game. please advise. mark :)
Interested in selling at Shreveport Farmers' Market? Send an email with your address, phone number, and what you'd like to sell to farmersmarket@redriverrevel.com. I'll add you to the database and invite you to our yearly organizational meeting, coming up March 14/15.
Once a week I will share a comment received from a loyal customer. This weeks comment comes from P.H. in FL.
"Just wanted to let you know that I'd always wanted to eat healthy, but found it difficult to give up red meat. Well, since I found your Tex Mex Veggie Burgers at the Whole Foods Grocer I'm able to say that eating healthier will be less of a chore. I really like the flavor of the burgers... And, with a slice of cheese, they're awesome! You've really come up with a good product."
What creative ways have you used our veggie burgers?

My parents divorced when I was a teen. They remained civil, but never reconnected except for when supporting me at my shows. George & Donna, my mom & pops, would attend together. They would spend that time in each others presence and find ways to share a few nice moments. That spark that had died out would flicker and fade again. Yet, they both admitted to me many times their love for one another was still in their hearts. The love of each others lives they would both say. They were beyond repair, sadly. I never saw my folks stop and smile at each other again except in a photo with me in it but not alone together. They passed away but I know for a fact they are dancing/smiling up there together. I took these pics and decided today to celebrate a Valentines Day they never had again... but would've wanted. I love & miss you mom & pops. Dance one for me. I created this in a few hours this morning. I call it George & Donna - 2nd Date.
Most people are what they hate but I can strongly assure you that I am not an oatmeal cookie.
I just got inked. Ok, well, maybe not tattooed, more like the ketchup on my sandwich dripped on my chin & it looks like a ladybug.
I wish while having sex w/a girl whose on top of me a small boulder would fall on her back just so I can say, "You really are stuck between a rock and a hard place."

Dear Kraft: I've been eating and loving Miracle Whip for 50 years. Pretty sure that back then it wasn't made with HFCS. Make me feel a little bit better about my favorite guilty pleasure by putting it back the way it was. 'K? Thx.
Does anyone have a good recipe for Red potato salad? Thanks
I just made my first batch of Kraft Home-Style Mac and Cheese, and OOOPS! It came out all brown and nasty looking. I think I burned the butter when I put it into the pan that i had used to cook the pasta. Then when I added the cheese, I got a volcanic eruption adn lots more brown. Yuk! 
PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES
* * I need a tip* * Im going to attempt to make a cheesecake for my son's 10th birthday this weekend. I got a recipe from a friend that my wife tried before and just loved. What can I use instead of a small pie pan? Can I use a cake pan? I want to triple the recipe but I don't want three pies. Id like a cake sized cheesecake if that makes any sense. Also, Ive never made a graham cracker crust, any suggestions?
My country or city is Puerto Rico, not the one that appears in the direction. Thank you. I hope that they arrange it am interested in the magazine.
Do you have any recipes for baked tilapia (healthy, nonbreaded)?
Can you explain why in the world you have high fructose corn syrup in your Claussen pickles? I dont recall this being in there previously. You ruined a great product. I will no longer be buying them, and will tell everyone I know not to as well. It is irresponsible on your company's part. And you webite email contact form doesn't work! 
I'm posting this recipe for those of you who may never have tried it sooooooo good :) 1 box of Kraft Mac n Cheese made as directed Add 1 can of tuna fish 1 can of cream of mushroom soup 1/2 can to 3/4 can of milk top with stuffing, broken potato chips or other crunchy topping bake at 350 until golden brown and bubbly........yummo!!
Made a philly recipe yesterday...TO DIE FOR. But i have a question for you. Is your site always like this or is just something wrong. For instance, when I am searching for an appetizer, I have 22 pgs of recipes to choose from. Ok, so I'm on page 8 and I see a recipe I think I might like and I click on it. Then I go back to keep searching and it brings me to page one again. Is that how it always is? 
I want to make some tamales but was wondering how to measure masa. I tried measuring it like flour in a different recipe last night (spooned and not packed), but it didn't seem to come out right. Should it be measured more like sugar?

Tried the new Cream Cheese Creme tonight, the Cheese and Garlic one. Made linguini with it, like the have on the website. It was ok, not as good as I expected. It was a little too sweet or something was just off. I thought it would be better considering it's price. Anyone had better luck with the other flavors?

Great 30 minute healthy meals, which my kids and I enjoy cooking together.. Thank you ( :
Great Ideas!! I'm going to make the cupcakes for my Valentine's Day picnic with my family. Yes... picnic, it is quite warm down here in Miami, FL. 
I'm really excited that my hubby just bought me a huge chest freezer, but I am not having any luck finding freezer meals on the Kraft site! It would be super useful if Kraft would put together a section/tab on the website just for freezer meals! I want breakfasts, lunches, and dinners that I can whip up and freeze for a good while, please!
Soups
Blanche all in season veggies then freeze for the winter. Also my Mexican Lasange made with Kraft cheese of course in squares to be Microwaved later for a great meal.

I am an avid fan of all Kraft products. Love them all and buy them all, but am disappointed that there are no coupons for maxwell house coffee, all the other coffee brands are throwing coupons my way, but I need some maxwell coupons. We drink the Maxwell Lite every morning- 2 full pots, so it gets pretty expensive. any help would be appreciated, especially since the prices are going up as we have all seen recently reported. Keep on making all our favorite products!
Love the cooking creme. I tried the italian cheese and herb. I made a lasagna and used the cooking creme instead of cottage or ricotta cheese and layered it with shredded mozzarella as well. I got two yummys and thumbs up from my husband and daughter.
i love ur cheese :):):)
Loved the Mocha Cheesecake. Made it for my husband's birthday party and got rave reviews!
I am making a turkey dinner for my family next weekend and my dressing/stuffing never turns out right. I am looking for an easy receipe to impress my family. Thanks!!
What is this cooking cream and why can't I find it at my grocery store in Cleveland Ohio ?
Just found out why my Amazon recurring order of Cafe Francaise International Coffee was canceled. It wasn't that they are discontinuing the coffee - no, they have reduced the ounces in the tins from 8 ounces to 7.6 ounces and raised the cost by about .64 a tin on Amazon. This was what I meant about being tired of big businesses making things smaller and hoping we don't notice as they raise the $. Or creating "new formulas" in smaller containers and charging more. Guess I am done with this coffee that has been part of my day (the only coffee I drank) ever since it came out. Good Going Maxwell House. Way to keep your customers happy.
We were invited to an ugly sweater party and I couldn't resist making an ugly sweater cake.

I just wanted to let you know that your fat free mayo is freakin amazing. Literally. I don't know how you did it. Now if you could just reduce the sodium content a bit, you would have the worlds most perfect mayo...
Just learned that KRAFT discontinued "Postum" with no public notice, and because they thought it wasnt making "enough" profit.........HEY KRAFT, JUST HOW MUCH IS "enough" TO YOU ANYWAY? I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER KRAFT PRODUCT AGAIN AND WILL ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO THE SAME UNLESS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR STUPID DECISION, AND BRING POSTUM BACK!........ SEE IF IT HURTS IN YOUR WALLET! 
Who was the chef's that came up this Apple stuffing Stove top. OMG the smell and then the taste. It's not good when you have to wash your mouth out and brush your teeth after a couple of bites, and then the flavor still lingers. 
Where can I find the recipe for that yummy-looking pasta, zucchini and cheese dish I just saw on tv? I think it was a shredded mozzarella commercial.

I was offered a $4.49 coupon to try Philadelphia Cooking Cream on your taste of home sight and when it printed, I only got a $1.50 coupon.:(
Hi, I'm from the US but live in Panam where we don't have access to a wide variety of Kraft products. However, I like to use the recipes to give me ideas of what I can make here, even if I have to change some ingredients. I'm now pregnant and can't eat hardly anything. I've discovered non-spicy, non-dairy recipes with either ground beef or the steak strips that are commonly used for fajitas are about the only types of meat I can eat. I'm looking to find some easy, first trimester-friendly recipes to try. Any suggestions? Thanks!
Hello my name is Megan and I'm a military wife and mother of a 2 yr old son, I love to cook, but its very hard when meal time comes around because I find myself cooking a meal for my husband and I and then one for my son, it seems to be the same almost every night....noodles or potatoes....does anyone have any suggestions on how to get him to eat other new things....and since the hubby has pt early in the morning I find myself up at 0430 every morning to fix him something to eat.....does anyone have anything that quick easy and Yummy for that first meal and it has to be super healthy thanks
I don't think it's right that you give some people a free coupon to try something, and other's just get a coupon for an amount off!
I signed up for a kraft first account and took the survey, but was only given a $1.50/1 coupon, where most others are getting the message that they are being mailed a coupon for FREE cooking creme. I'm reading now that the people who are receiving that coupon are the ones that said they share all of their recipes with people they know, etc. I'm a stay at home mom that runs two businesses from home- I don't have time to be sharing recipes, but I would really like to try your product. Could you please send me a coupon to try it for free?
What happened to the Apple Stuffing! It was soo good..
i have 2 lil one under 5 and they are not big meat eaters.. do u have any ideas what i can make that has little to no meat on it? 
I use to love eggrolls; but I am now allergic to the wrappers and peanut oils/ products (sesame oil too). Does anyone have some good eggroll recipes that possible uses cabbage as the wrapper. I would really like to be able to enjoy this dish again.
Have kids help cook. If they cook it, they like to try it. Also, my kids had a teaspoon of whatever put on their plate to try. If they don't try new things, how are they to know? Also, parents should not say out loud, or around the kids what they don't like. Kids like to be like mom or dad. 
Oh! Breakstone's and Knudsen are now on Facebook! Do you prefer cottage cheese or sour cream?
I like cottage cheese AND sour cream, but not at the same time:)
I really love cottage cheese...with cracked black pepper. 
Sour Cream for me...wont say no to Cottage Cheese tho.

I teach cake decorating and last month we, about 30 students, did a blind taste test of Duncan Hines, Pillsbury and Betty Crocker yellow cake with no butter, just oil. Betty Crocker came out on top with Pillsbury second and Duncan Hines WAAaaay behind. You won! Definitely the most most cake with the best flavor. It was fun to see people's reactions and to here how many people changed what cakes they buy now!! Great work!

I made these Chocolatey Football Bites from Kraft Recipes to kick-off the Super Bowl weekend! They were super easy to make, and my coworkers gobbled them up. I added chunky peanut butter to the recipe too.. because who doesn't love chocolate AND peanut butter? To get the perfect football shape, I packed them tightly in an oval (KitchenAid) ice cream scoop. I also used buttercream frosting in a decorators bag for the laces, since I had that on hand.

Took my daughter to Orland Park, Il ULTA for her birthday Highlights. 3/4 of the way done foiling her hair, the Store had a POWER OUTAGE!!! The power never came back on. Flashlights to finish, shampoo. She had to leave with a wet head, as THE BLIZZARD took it's hold of the Chicago area. Still had to pay full price!
just had a keritan treatment done, not so fond of it. still have much curl and frizz. still have to blow it out and use a flat iron,,,, not worth the price....................
My freinds wanna try a bikini waxing before she go on on her vacation.................who know how it feel and isn't embarass ? Isn't $35 at Ulta ? Please answer me back...really wanna know :)
Isn't bare essential make up is a best one in store or smashbox ? Wanna buy make up for mom on valentine
AS A person in the fashion industry, I would like to reitterate that it doesn't matter whether you have a receipt or not (of course it helps if you have it), but the corporations bottom line should be the customer. WOM is crucial and the most powerful ad. agent. I know - and the fashion industry builds itself on editorial help. They should know that incidents like this will leak. Companies from low-end, like Target, to high-end, like Nordstrom, are defined by their incredible customer service. I have never been questioned at either one and continue to shop there time and time again. The thing is they know that keeping me as a customer is more important than arguing about receipts. 
Has anyone else bought the Ulta brand lotion? I bought the coconut lime yesterday which smells great in the bottle, but once it's been on for awhile, it stinks so bad I can't stand to smell myself. Curious if anyone else had the same experience. 
just went to ulta for the first time today... got the promo gift set they had... i will be returning! i love the make-up, and the nail color was one coat and dried really fast!!! love it!
I made my first visit to my Greenville, SC area store after receiving an ULTA circular in my paper. I just recently moved to the area and was unaware of the store's existence beforehand. When I do purchase makeup it is typically from Sephora, which is 3 hours away. I have been searching for a closer alternative and was excited to seek out ULTA in my area. Upon arriving in the store, I was not greeted nor approached by any of the sales staff whatsoever the entire 45 minutes I was there. Granted it was clearly a rather busy time for the store, but it seemed to me the free associates were seeking out the more prestige type of consumer rather than myself.
For a prom look right off of the Fashion Week runways, try a braided ponytail! ULTA stylists just arrived back from New York Fashion Week where they created this sleek and trendy look for runway models. Just pull hair high on the crown, braid, and use a finishing spray like Redkens Fashion Work 12 Versatile Working Spray to a create smooth, polished finish. 7 DAYS UNTIL THE PROM PREVIEW PARTY AT ULTA!
Salon at ULTA hair stylists were backstage with Redken expert and celebrity stylist Rodney Cutler to create the styles for the Carlos Miele show at New York Fashion Week on February 14. ULTA stylists Mezei Jefferson, Jenna Edmunds, Nicole DeRuyck and Lindsay Welsh arrived from across the country to create trendy braided ponytails for the show models. The simple and sleek hair was a perfect contrast to the bold and textured fashions shown on the runway.

Shannon Hughsley ....you rock...this was the best car buying experience ever....quick sweet and Shannon was the icing on the cake. My credit union tried to take me on a roller coaster ride and Shannon with his in depth knowledge of the business and his cool" that is not a problem" demeanor was the winning combination to getting the vehicle I wanted, desperately needed and proudly sporting....Thanks Carmax....Thank you Shannon...#1 Carmax agent in my book!!!!!
GREAT service, Great Staff Sales to Finance. department. Special thanks to Mr, Kourosh (K.G.)@ Burbank Carmax.
I am totally satisfied with my 2008 Nissan Altima Coupe and the Carmax purchasing experience! The vehicle was prepared (detailed in car jargon) so well it could easily pass for new. They even changed the oil and filled the tank. The price I paid was a bit less than the Kelly Blue Book price, so there is no premium for the prep work, 5 day unconditional return policy and 30 day mechanical warranty. I can't imagine paying for a new car again. 
we have bought our last 4 cars from carmax!! Great friendly service quick easy. Best car deals around & no hassle with the prices. Also have a vested interest in 1 of the managers at Merriville location. Dad & mom are proud of you!!!! 
With all this talk of customer service I thought I would share a story with you: 3 years ago my mom and packed and stuffed my Buick Century with everything I own and left for an 18 hour drive (from northern Illinois to southern Georgia) to start college. About 9 hours into the trip my Buick died, a local mechanic said it was unrepairable. After much freaking out and crying we decided to have it towed to the nearest CarMax (Knoxville, Tn) It was there I bought my Suzuki Forenza sales lady was so kind, all the employees sympathized with our dire situation. By the time we were done with all the paper work and sales formalities it was well after closing. 
just saw the commercial haa
I just got home from purchasing my second car from CarMax. Great experience. :-)
Regis and Kelly just mentioned the Carmax commercial! They liked it!!!
I just wanted to say that our car salesman, Adam from the Fredericksburg VA store, was the BEST salesman we have ever had. Over the past 2 days he has taken the time to work with us to make sure we are confident in our purchase. The level of customer service we got with Adam was AMAZING. I would HIGHLY recommend any Fredericksburg area residents to see Adam for their next car purchase. He is the best yet. I hope that CarMax Corp will recognize him for his hard work and efforts. Thank you, Adam. 
we just purchased our first car from carmax and it was the best experience ever. everything went so smooth. they are so organized and really have it ALL together. THANK YOU to the BEST car salesman EVER.......BLAKE KING IN NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINIA. Y'ALL ROCK........THANKS AGAIN !!!!!
i was weary about buying from carmax, but until i found the trailblazer ss i was looking for at car max i had to jump on it my salesman gabe at the hillside location, got me approved in under 2 mins!!! came in the next day and probably the cleanest ss i have seen in a long time, but it was damaged small damage, and gabe knew at the time im a bodyman and know 2 body men that work there gabe and the manager bent over backwards to help me and make the truck perfect, the buying process had to be the easiest and smoothest i have ever experienced!! i love my truck gabe and the manager were awesome!! keep up the good work
I saw a red Honda Civic get pulled over this morning and it made me think about the old saying that if you buy a red car, your chances of getting pulled over increase. Is that really true? Anyone have an experience they'd like to share? ~elia
William Agee, best salesman ever! Need a car contact him. 
This will probably be removed as well, but I just wanted to say in a little less colorful language, that my experience with Carmax was nothing like the commercials. My salesperson might as well have been wearing the full on shifty used car salesperson outfit complete with white shoes, a matching white belt and plaid slacks. He used every high pressure trick in the book. It was a worse than any experience I've ever had in a dealership. I asked for a ball park figure on what my monthly payments would be on a car I was interested in. Part of that equation was my trade in vehicle. You are supposed to get a no obligation quote on your trade in according to the CarMax ads. The sales person asked me to remove my belongings from the vehicle before they evaluated it. I thought this was pretty strange, but I played along. I guess they can't properly evaluate a car if you have an umbrella in the back seat. Which seems kind of silly.
Carmax is horrible! I purchased a brand new 2010 Nissan Sentra in Aug! Had nothing but problems with it! 6th time in the shop, no resolutions! Mr Bob Bolton of the White Marsh Md store has yet to return any calls after we left several messages! Went to pick our car up today, after they had it for 3 weeks, stating it was fixed! Went to get in it, check engine light was on and engine running bad! So, you tell me! Need I say more! I dont know who is worse Carmax or Nissan for taking responsibilty on this matter! But, its not over!
Just joined the Carmax Boynton Sales Team. Looking forward to my first day next week.
My mom's been asking when our next trip to NY is....and as much as I want to visit, the 10 hour drive north isn't fun. But, I'm betting some of you just love to take long road trips. What are some of your most memorable? ~elia
I just bought my first car from you guys and I love the car and the price and it was my dream car.... A Nissan Altima 2.5s... Ali in Fayetteville was great and i look forward to doing business with you guys again
Road construction remains a constant in my daily commute. Repaving, building an overpass, widening the lanes, have all ocurred over the 7 years I have worked here. At least I can now safely exit to 295 without fear of collision! I bet each of you have dealt with your share of "road improvement" projects; I would love to hear some - for better or worse! ~elia
Those little inspection stickers and registration stickers on our license plates often go unnoticeduntil its too late and a nice police officer reminds you! Have you ever missed your annual state inspection or forgot to update your registration stickers on your car? ~Michelle
7148 Helping people realize that they can afford their dream car. PRICELESS 
Do not ever take your car to knoxville tn locations to sell it. Their appraiser took out my car for test drive and 45 minutes later brought it back on a roll back. Hit a curb so hard bent front left tire all the way back against the fender. Calling corp office monday as they now making crappy offers on car. They even tried to cover it up by not calling police and saying they would fix in their shop there. Told them no and contacted police and their ins co!!
Recently bought from the Greenville location, it was by far the best dealership so far. Up front with the price and all the financing was there on the screen. No spending hours trying to change the numbers to make it work....great experience for us. 
It's President's Day. Now we know Washington didn't get a car for his birthday, but have you ever given or received or even purchased a car for YOUR birthday?
So gas prices are rising again. (Sigh.) Is that effecting your daily commute or upcoming travel plans? ~Britt
I just got my second car from CarMax today. Eric H. at the North Houston store was awesome. He helped me find exactly the car I was looking for and was so helpful every step of the way. He wasn't pushy at all the first time I went just to look at cars with no intention of buying that day. He helped transfer the perfect car for me. So I went home with an awesome 2009 Ford Escape that's perfect! Thanks CarMax!!
It's a rainy Friday here in Richmond & lots of drivers forgot about the law to have your lights on when your wipers are on. Have you ever thought about reviewing your state's driver's manual to get refreshed on the laws and updated information? Lots of this information is easy to forget! ~Michelle
Just bought our 3rd car from Carmax! A Mini-Cooper! Our way of fighting gas prices! Thank you Carmax!
Carmax Naperville,IL we just bought a Toyota Corolla 2003 with 51k "new" like condition very Happy with this car,especially with the gas prices up well over 4 bucks a gallon now(premium grade)
Gas conservation tip of the day: Whenever possible, use synthetic oil: look for Energy Conserving motor oil; it will reduce friction and increase fuel economy. Happy driving! ~Britt
Dear Carmax, Why are your no-haggle prices higher than those of certified pre-owned cars at the dealer's lot? What formula do you use to set resale value?

Filling our cars with gas is such a drag, especially as gas prices continue to rise. And we have hybrid cars these days, but they still require gas. What about a true plug-in car that required no gasoline? Would you be willing to buy one someday? ~elia

Confession. I am the type of person that would stop, hold up traffic and help the little ducks across the road. So I say kudos to Florida's finest and the other driver that helped the chicken...err duck...cross the road. ~Britt

After 2 1/2 hours waiting for our pizza delivery on Thursday, my husband called the chain. The manager said it would be free. But, 30 minutes later when it arrived, my husband told the delivery man about the charge off. The guy grunted "oh, heck no," and walked back to his car with our pizza in his hand. Tell us your unbelievable customer service stories. 
Alright, ya'll. I'll admit it. I haven't decided who I am cheering for yet - Packers or Steelers. I'm too busy reading the funny customer service stories on makehistory.carmax.com. Check out the one about the creme brulee. ~Britt

My husband bought a car here about a 1 yr ago. We love his car! Then my son went about 2 weeks ago and purchased a car. Dado is a great advisor! I don't want to call him a salesman cause he wasn't pushy or anything. I went back that next weekend and talked with Dazi, She was great! she set us up for a appraisal for the truck we sold and walked around the lot with us while waiting. She was very generous in showing us anything that caught my eye. The next weekend my truck's axel broke, Yep time for a new one. and I just had to come back to Carmax for my new car. It was a great experience! Working with Dado and Dazi ( Dado is her mentor) Dado called the next Monday to see how satisfied I am. I appreciate great customer service! now we have 3 great vehicles in our drive way all from CarMax. THANK YOU CarMax!!! <3 Jacksonville, FL.
Darn it! I spilled coffee in the car this morning. And, to make matters worse couldn't find anything to wipe it up! Do you keep paper towels or baby wipes in your car as a standard? ~Britt
A big thumbs up to you guys for standing behind your cars 2.5 years after a sale!! I'd also like to thank your Schaumburg store associate, Shaun Kruger, for exceptional customer service!! Keep up the great work...

I'm allergic to sulfites, a family of preservative used in most dried fruit these days. I'm sure you don't use these, but I just wanted to make sure. I'm suffering from a horrible headache right now, because I didn't check the label on some oatmeal I ate. I'm really wanting a better option.
Have been eating your oatmeals for years! Awesome! I can be lazy and not add my own ingredients! Ha ha...I have liked all the products I have tried!
The Wirral Group of Coeliac UK are hosting a Gluten Free Food and Accommodation Fair on Saturday 5th March at Ellesmere Port Civic Hall, Cheshire from 10am until 3pm, would you be able to exhibit at this?

Something to watch out for... LA's farmers markets are having a big problem with commercial veggies being sold as "loca and sustainable". Know your sources! http://redgreenandblue.org/2011/02/02/fraud-at-the-farmers-market/
Is this the end of organics? Now that it's been completely deregulated by the USDA, Monsanto's GMO alfalfa could pollute all organic meat and dairy in the US... http://redgreenandblue.org/2011/01/28/end-of-organics-monsantos-gmo-alfalfa-approved/
I just love your cereals and eat them everyday. All of your products are tasty and it's so great to know that when you grab anything off the shelf from the Nature's Path product line, you don't even have to read the label....you just know it's made with all the right ingredients for healthy eating!!! Thanks NPOF!!! 
my mother swears by organic foods, despite the additional cost! I just wish that I could afford to eat it all the time as well, but sadly I can not, though I have relatives who have a number of food issues, a couple who are Vegan, as well as one who has a severe Gluten allergy as well as Lactose intollerance as well.
I have a major gluten allergy and many of your products I was able to eat, and maintain my goal to go 100% organic some day. Unfortunately since then I have been diagnoses with tons of other allergies like eggs, peanuts and soy to name a few. I miss your products :-(

I absolutely LOVE your oatmeal! I am allergic to sulfites, the preservative in most other oatmeals with fruit. I now realize what substandard mush I was eating before. Your oatmeal is so filling and DELICIOUS too that I find myself thinking about it as soon as I wake up, and it gets me out of bed quick!
CHOCOCONUT!
I just bought your Nature's Path Ultimate Oatmeal with Cinnamon & Blueberries at our local Cost Cutter Market in Blaine last week. The first packet had NO blueberries but the next one out of the same box had some. It's outstanding! I wish you would market the Ultimate oatmeal products at COSTCO in Bellingham, WA
I just simply love your products, too bad that I moved to Peru and I'm no longer able to get them!
I just purchased a box of Love Crunch at Whole Food's and couldn't wait to get home to try it. This is seriously one of the BEST things that I have ever tasted!!!!!!
I see that Nature's Path doesn't offer any type of juices, which organic juice would you recommend? My favorite right now is an organic pear juice called GoGo Juice, www.GoGoJuice.com.
I love your hemp or flax oatmeal!
I love the gluten free buckwheat and wild berries waffles! Finally a gluten free product that tastes yummy! Thanks!

I love your Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal and flax plus cereal
Found your Mesa Sunrise flakes last time I wanted 2 try something new. They are *so* GOOD! Hubby doesn't need sugar, & he usually uses 2-3 spoons. Plus we were looking for soluble fiber, so they are a happy addition to our diet. Definitely a keeper. Hope the grocer keeps them stocked - didn't seem them when I went back for more :(
I absolutely love your maple bar and choconut bar. My breakfast every morning! Great for snacks too! I could live on these bars! 
I am a "newbie" to celiac and I found your product last week. Very tasty~ the pumpkin and spice bars are great! looking forward to your other products that are safe for me.
I am loving your products, however...I am diabetic and I was wondering if you are addressing the sugar content in some of your foods? It is so hard to find product with a healthy level of sugar and sodium. Just curious if you can direct me to some of your better choices for folks in my situation :D
Nature's Path Smart Bran is sooo good! For a special treat, I mix a little peanut butter to the dry cereal and crumble it on greek yogurt and fruit sundaes. Try it dry too, for the added crunch!
I am eating my Flax Plus hot oatmeal and it is my FAVORITE!!!! :)
Just tried your peanut butter granola last night and loved it!!! Sooooo good!
My house went totally organic in May 2010 and I must say your products have helped make the transition simple for us. LOVE the Cherry Pomegran Toaster Pastries! 
Addicted to your Pumpkin Flax Cereal!
Hey great cereal! I stumble upon your brand while browsing my local grocery stores shelves for something different and wholesome. The fact your brand was on sale this week, helped me be more willing to try your brand. I was also very happy to not find any mysterious chemical names or artificial crap listed on the ingredients label. I chose the Crunchy Maple Sunrise and the Optimum Blueberry Cinnamon cereals for my first purchase. This morning I had a serving of the Maple Sunrise and wow! to my surprise I was greeted with probably the best tasting cereal that I've had in a long time. And the nice crunch was just right! I've added Nature's Path cereal to my list of 'buy this again' items.
Hello! I've recently started a quest to eat healthier foods, particularly by increasing whole grains and eliminating HFCS and GMO foods. I still wanted my cereal to be slightly sweet, so I picked up a box of your Crunchy Maple sunrise randomly from the organic section of my local grocer. It was wonderful! Since then I've tried your other cold and hot cereals and they have all tasted great and I know that I'm eating better. Thanks for making great tasting cereals that are made out of actual natural FOOD!
Your Pumpkin Flax Plus Organic Granola Cereal is BY FAR the BEST I've ever had! It pairs perfectly with Almond milk... Wonderful! :-P
LOVE the Chococonut bars! AMAZING!
The good news is that your Choco-Peanut bars are amazing... the bad news is that I'm addicted! It's hard to eat just one each day.... So glad I found 'em.
Cannabis Hemp's industrial potential alone, is estimated to make over 50,000 consumer products ranging from a stronger and safer Plastic, to a more flexible and durable Concrete. It's local, sustainable, and a cheap renewable option that Big Oil cannot compete with, rethink why the Cannabis Plant is illegal.
I began eating your SmartBran cereal daily -- and it resulted in a lowering of my cholesterol level. Easy and delicous way to get healthier!
I was wondering if Love Crunch is something you always sell or if it was a V day type thing. I purchased some during V day and it was the first time I had ever seen it. It is excellent by the way. I wasn't sure if it was a sold year round so I stocked up last time I was at Whole Foods was pleasantly surprised to see on the box that $1 of every box sold goes to fighting world hunger. You really can't go wrong with that <3
Of the estimated 350,000 species in the plant kingdom, Industrial Cannabis Hemp, is our #1 option for Fuel, Paper, Fiber, and Plastic, while the female flowers are a safe relaxation method and seeming to be the best defense against most deadly diseases.

Kalyn, thanks for all you do; from your own recipes to finding and tweaking others for us. I've tried many of your recipes and each has been so very good. One thing I would like to suggest is that, if you know, please tell us when a recipe is good for freezing or not. I am single, and sometimes I will reduce the recipes by half if I think they will still work, but.... Please know this is not a complaint, just a suggestion. I "heart" your site and recipes and since the first of this year, I have lost 17.2 pounds via SouthBeach!
Kalyn your escarole and parm with pine nuts recipe was amazing - my teenage boys ate the entire dish! thanks
hi kalyn i love your recipes so much...i had done the SBD diet a year before,and guess what kept me motivated all along.....YOUR RECIPES.i tried out all your omelet recipes and most of chicken and lamp recipes.i am gonna start again next week and yesterday i was going through your vegetarian section and found many recipes with indian spices,i didnt know i could eat many of them:) so i am guessing most indian curries are good for SBD,ones which doesn't use much of oil or butter.thanks for your recipes!
Love the Goulash Cabbage Soup! Can it be adapted to chicken instead of beef?
Wondering, as I enter my second week of Phase 2, which pasta you recommend. Whole wheat or Dreamfields?
Yeah! I see you exceeded your 2 extra 'likes'. Believe me, I'd 'like' you a hundred times if I could Kalyn!! Thanks for everything you do and share:)
I just recieved a bunch of red and yellow peppers. How South Beach friendly are they and do you have any yummy ways to prepare them?
I just upgraded this page to the new profile page for websites. Hopefully everything will still work like it used to, and I do kind of like seeing the photos at the top of the page! (I find Facebook hard to navigate sometimes, so bear with me if something seems a bit odd at first!)
I attribute my success so far to your recipes! I've been on SB for 6 weeks now and I knew the only way I could do it was if my family was on board with me (at least for dinner). Since I've started we've had SB friendly dinners every night from your website, and not one complaint yet! Thanks so much!
Hiya! I'm a follower of the South Beach diet and I recently discovered your website and may I just say how brilliant it is! The SBD is a great diet but the recipes get boring after a while.. Your website has given my diet a new kickstart! Thank you!
Found you on the web by accident. Thanks for posting your recipes. I'm going to try your egg muffins this weekend. 
I was trying to make your Hummusa dressing..Is it purable like salad dressing or is it to be thick like to dip with a sppon. Also i saw a recipe made with balcamic vinegarette have you tried a verson of that.
Sausage, lentil and tomato soup -- huge hit! Huge!!! Yum!! (Added a little Parmesan cheese for non SB person!!!) 
I would like to make the Bread Machine Recipe for 100% Whole Wheat Bread with Oats, Bran, and Flax Seed but it calls for "dough enhancer" and I have not been able to find it here. I looked it up on Amazon.com and it can be ordered for $5 + with $13 + shipping. Can I substitute something? 
I LOVE your recipes! Just sayin... ;o)
You are amazing in the way you respond on your blog and here. I have been using you for a few months, and you have inspired me to starting back on phase 1 of SBD. When you trim the fat off of pork, what do you do with it? I've never heard of "Pork stock" but it seems like something can be done with it.
Kalyn, your blog is incredible--so easy to use, beautiful to look at, wonderfully organized, and so very helpful for healthy and delicious cooking! As a fellow teacher, I don't know how you do it, but I'm very thankful you do.
Kalyn, I made your stir-fried-shrimp-with-snow-peas tonight, and MAN! Talk about flavor! So, so good! It was so quick and easy, too! Thank you!
When I woke up to snow, I was glad to have this Spicy Sausage, Lentil, and Tomato Soup in the fridge: http://goo.gl/YzqAH [New blog post]

I'm just curious...would you say this is below standard for Pizza Luce?
Thank you St. Paul Luce for the AMAZING gluten free artichoke dip last night....where on earth do you get those rolls?
Thanks for opening up the Hopkins location! Now I can get Pizza Luce delivered:) I look forward to biking there too in summer!
I'm coming to town next week for QBP's show and am staying at Minneapolis Marriott Southwest, which store delivers here? And if the answer is none, what do I have to do to get someone to deliver to me? I had a car last year and ate at pizza Luce and LOVED it! I've been dreaming of more of your gluten free pizza and delicious rolls! 
I was able to enjoy Pizza Luce in St. Paul last night, and now I am in love with everything about your restaurant. What a fantastic atmosphere! I still have the warm fuzzies <3
Yum! Our delicious homemade tiramisu for delivery or pick up. A sweet for your sweetie! Buy any dessert today and we'll donate 100% your purchase to Second Harvest food bank.
Dear Pizza Luc, who won the "create & name a 3-topping pizza" thingy? Are you still taste-testing?
We just launched some new web ads to promote our online ordering. Let us know what you think. You can see samples here: http://pizzaluce.com/fb/
Dear pizza luce, plz open a branch in saltlake city utah!! U would make lots of money because you have awesome pizza and all the pizza places out here suck!
One summer when everyone was out of town except me I mosied into Pizza Luce and ordered a Margarita Pizza with pesto and dried tomatoes. The wait for it was lengthy but very much worth it because that Margarita pizza tasted so perfect and heavenly delicious. I LOVED IT! why did Pizza Luce stop making it??? Please go back to making the Margarita Pizza. (Duluth MN)

Just tried some Happy Goat Caramels that I picked up at Williams Sonoma. Great texture, good flavor, hint of savoriness that comes from the goat milk and goat butter used to make them.

Congrats to the Western Conference for taking the 60th NBA All-Star game. Also a great game by Kobe who dropped 37 on his home court and locked down his fourth MVP.
Here's an answer for @Jarar Hussain who wanted to know why the adiZero Rose All Star was yellow, coming straight from the adidas' designers Robbie Fuller and David Cin: "Yellow is a nod to Simeon Career Academy where Derrick played high school ball. Its also a nod to the sunny and Golden State of California where the game is played."
Another big NBA trade: Deron Williams is heading to the New Jersey Nets. That's the second Western Conference All-Star (Melo) to go East this week! Which team gets the bigger boost Knicks or Nets?

Please join the fight against genetically modified crops. President Obama keeps approving the use of Monsanto's GMO's and I don't think he realizes who devastating their use will be. Monsanto's GMO alfalfa has already been approved and once in production this one crop will take over. It will contaminate organic alfalfa that gets fed to livestock. There will be no more organic milk, no more organic meat. Whole Foods, Organic Valley and Stonyfield Farms have already given up, stating that we need to coexist with GMO's. Unfortunately, there will be no coexistence, there will only be GMO's. There is no telling what the long term health effects of eating the genetically engineered crops will be, but there are measurable negative health effects already shown in farm workers exposed to the Round-Up Ready alfalfa. This is not what this country needs, please help!
Yay I just saw your pouches featured on Dr. Oz!

Cooking Tip: The best way to test whether an egg has gone bad is to float it in water. When you keep an egg for a longer duration, the inside portion of the egg starts to decompose and builds gases. It will float! A fresh egg will not float, but lie at the bottom of the glass of water. Via BrightHub.com

Just a big thank you! Zoes Birmingham catered the "Tailgating with Pam Tebow" fundraiser for "Just Keep Smiling" this past Tuesday night. As always, the food was delicious. Thank you for giving back:-)
I stopped by Zoes to pick up something for a get-together this week and the General Manager put together a beautiful chicken salad platter that was perfect. If he didn't customize it for me - it sure felt like he did. My friends were curious as to who made the delicious chicken salad and when I said Zoes, they all said "IN Birmingham? You went to Birmingham?" They didn't know Zoes has two locations in Atlanta since we're out in the burbs. There's pent up demand out here for you. Zoes! Everyone was aware of Zoes - but didn't know you were in Atlanta!

J'ai fait du gteau au fromage en suivant les conseils de cuisson et de refroidissement trouvs dans La chimie des desserts et effectivement, le gteau est aussi beau et crmeux qu'au resto. Miam! Par contre, quelqu'un aurait des trucs pour couper de belles tranches de gteau? La prparation au fromage colle sur le couteau, plus j'avance le couteau, plus il y a des mottons dessus, et mes morceaux ne sont pas aussi prsentables que je souhaiterais...

Bonjour Ricardo j'ai acheter une huile d'olive de marque Kirkland (Costco) j'aimerai savoir si je peut l'employer pour la cuisson et dans les recettes. Pour les vinaigrettes je crois que je devrais prendre une huile de meilleur qualit comme la extra-vierge. Sur l'tiquette arrire c'est cris composs d'huiles d'olive raffines et d'huiles d'olive vierges. Esce un bon choix sinon quel choisir, pour cuisson,recette,vinaigrette. J'attend une rponse de Ricardo ou de l'quipe. MERCI BEAUCOUP
Bravo pour la recette de la tarte aux poires caramlises et au chocolat - Excellent! Je l'ai partage avec ma famille en fin de semaine. Eloges unanimes!

Ce weekend, j'ai fait la crme glace au chocolat blanc: un pur dlice sucr que ma famille a ador! Je l'ai servie dans des coupes gaufres. Toutefois, un peu dur sortir du plat hermtique, mais j'avais peur de la sortir trop longtemps l'avance. Mon conjoint se demandait si on pouvait la dmouler pour en couper des tranches. J'ai pens de la faire congeler dans un plat dont le fond a t couvert de papier parchemin pour mieux dmouler. Est-ce possible?
J'ai bien aim l'mission d'aujourd'hui (rti de porc et patates jaunes). Une autre option avec les restes de porc qui me vient de ma belle mre Martine: effilocher la viande et y mettre du jus de cuisson puis rfrigrer. a fige un peu comme des cretons mais en bien meilleur. Elle appelle a de la galantine. C'est excellent sur des toasts le matin. galement, pour la cuisson du rti, je mets comme pice le mlange 4 pices doux. a contient de la cannelle, muscade, clou de girofle et piment de la Jamaque (je crois) et a se marie trs bien avec le porc. 
Je viens de faire le mac & cheese!! Compltement dlirant... mais a prend une petite salade (roquette et balsamique) sinon impossible de manger toute son assiette!!!
Bonjour, Dans la recette de gteau au chocolat, on a besoin de crme 35%. J'aimerais savoir quelle sorte de crme il faut utiliser : cuisson, champtre, rgulire, etc.? Merci beaucoup!
J'adore vos recettes Ricardo, elles sont d'ailleurs une grande source d'inspiration pour mes gteaux dcors sur mesure! J'ai une petite question cependant: est-ce qu'il y a un moyen facile de savoir si vos glaages et ganaches peuvent rester la temprature ambiante sans danger? Merci beaucoup!
J'aime tout. Ce que j'ai fait jusqu' maintenant...t'es champion avec ta gang ;) 
Bonsoir Ricardo, peux-tu me dire si par hasard, parmi tous les recettes que tu peux inventer ou que tu possdes, dis-moi, est-ce que tu pourrais me dire comment faire des petits pains aux patates. Je te dis a p.c.quand j'tais toute petite maman faisant a et c'tait un dlice, il faut que je te dise que c'tait dans ma jeunesse, j'en ai prsentement 63 ans. J'ai demand mes soeurs si parfois elles se souvenaient des bons petits pains aux patates, elles me disent que oui mais malheureusement personne la recette. Alors, Richardo, je me demandais si parfois que tu aurais une recette comme celle-ci, on mangeait a avec du beurre, c'tait un dlice. Peux-tu me donner des nouvelles ce sujet-ci! Merci beaucoup!
Bonjour Ricardo! Bravo toute l'quipe pour vos bonnes recettes! J'aurais une suggestion apporter pour le site de ricardo cuisine.com Il serait plaisant de voir apparatre pour chaque recette l'endroit d'o elle provient (dans quel volume et dans quel numro du magazine). De cette faon, je pourrais me rfrer directement au magazine pour effectuer la recette! Merci!

Je recevais la marrainne de mon fils de 5 ans pour souper et celui-ci me dit que c'tait lui qui allait faire le dessert .... je lui ai demand ce qu'il voulait faire et il me rpondit " Du Jello rouge comment on le fait? "Comme j'tais occupe avec mes invits je lui rpondis du salon "Tu ajoutes une tasse d'eau bouillante et tu brasses bien et ensuite tu ajoutes une tasse d'eau froide. .... nous les adultes nous continuons de placoter tout en entendant le petit brasser son Jello ... Apres une bonne quinzaine de minutes le petit me crie " Quand est-ce maman que l'on mets la poudre? .... Ricardo penses-tu que nous allons en faire un bon cuisinier?:)))

Grosse question existentielle pour Ricardo et/ou son quipe: J'habite en Suisse et comme toute bonne qubcoise, le fromage cheddar me manque (pour toutes mes recettes prfres). Alors, avec quel fromage pourrais-je le substituer??? Par exemple la recette de Mac&Cheese du dernier numro!!???!!! HELP!!

Peut-on remplacer le fromage mascarpone par autre chose dans le brownie au choco blanc?
la recette de gteau au chocolat est sublime et facile raliser : gteau disparu en 4 jrs et on est 4, et je lui ai a peine gout ;)
Je viens de faire la recettte de la tarte aux poires caramlises et au chocolat qui est dans le magasine. Je l'ai fait avec des pommmes comme il l'a fait l'mission. Ca sent SUPER bon. J'ai dj hte d'y goter se soir!!!!!
Aprs toute une semaine de supplication des enfants, nous avons enfin faits les bols en chocolat. Grosse dception :( Les ballons restent colls aux bols... Ils ont donc mang de la vaisselle casse! Y avait-il un truc supplmentaire??? Pourtant c'tait des ballons de bonne qualit.
Encore une fois dans l'une de vos dernires missions,vous avez soulign le fait qu'en Europe on utilise les grammes pour faire les recettes et que c'est mieux car bien entendu c'est plus prcis. J'aime les recettes europennes justement car on a moins de chance de se tromper. Serait-il possible d'avoir un tableau d'quivalence ou avoir ses mesures avec vos recettes? 
Nous nous rgalons des sublimes brownies au Nutella. Miam!
Did you know that buying block cheese instead of individually packed slices could save the energy equivalent of 13.8 million gallons of gasoline per year?...That's enough to send the entire population of Milwaukee in a carpool to visit those happy cows in California.
It's a Honey and Oat Blenders morning...i wish my spoon was as big as my bowl! Yum!
I made Malt O Meal's Magic Muffins last night...they are already all gone...Yummm!!
What happened to good ol' Chocolate Malt-O-Meal! I have been looking for it for MONTHS and cannot find it in any of the stores here in Rockwall, Texas. Had a friend looking for it for me in Anaheim and Cypress, California, and she couldn't find it anywhere either. I'm jonesing for some CHOCOLATE MALT-O-MEAL!!!!!
Do you know how just 5% of us could go about growing a (hypothetical) mature forest that could cover an area the size of Manhattan in just one year?
If just 5% of people in the US reused a paper grocery bag 3x as a trash can liner, they would save the paper equivalent a mature forest that could cover an area the size of Manhattan in just one year.
Your cereal rocks ! Your cereals better than the original ! Keep it up
My son with Autism has an extremely picky diet and Cinnamon Toasters is the only breakfast cereal he will eat. I always purchase the super size. Makes our life easier. Thanks Malt-O-Meal! 
I am a big fan of the Malt-O-Meal Cereal, but I found it quite hypocritical to be walking through the store yesterday to find your cereal brand, the new 2x2, IN A BOX! Are you kidding me???? Wasn't your whole campaign "BAG THE BOX"? I'm guessing you could have found a way to package that differently. Not that I won't keep buying your cereal, just thought that was pretty dumb.
Did you know that a decrease in US household consumption of just three rolls of paper towels per year would save 120,000 tons of waste and $4.1 million in landfill dumping fees?
When are you guys going to make a peanut butter flavored cold cereal?
I love love your products especially Malt-o-Meal but today I see something on your product that upsets me. Why do you feel the need to put English and Spanish on your products?? Does it bring up the cost of the product?? Today in America, legal citizens are suffering all around with the cost of gas, food, taxes, etc. on the rise. I don't agree with companies like yourself that caters to others just for a profit. That is NOT the right America way and too many companies like yourself don't understand that it's an insult to Americans that have to pay extra for illegal citizens that don't want to learn our language, take valuable resources from us, demand more, all the while we legal American citizens have to sit back and pay for everything even when our country is in dire fiscal chaos.
Did you know that if each of the 80 million US households that buy canned tuna replaced just one 6oz can purchase per year with a 6oz fresh fish purchase, the amount of water and fish saved could fill a seventy-foot-high aquarium spanning two soccer fields with more than twelve thousand 100 lb. yellowfin tuna?
I've been hearing that some of us are looking for varieties that aren't available at some retail locations. Thanks for reaching out on Facebook! I will do what I can to from here to help you find it in your area. While you're shopping, be sure to ask Store Managers to start stocking it. Tell them you want to Bag The Box!
still no delivery to Marquee Mall Angeles City, Philippines. hope to have a HUGE delivery soon!! been out of Malt-O-Meal for 2 months now :(
Asheboro Chamber of Commerce Honors Malt-O-Meal
Has anyone tried the new Blueberry Mini Spooners yet?
Did you know that if every household in the US & Canada did something as simple as choosing to buy bread wrapped in a single wrapper instead of a double wrapper, it would save as much as 60,000 pounds of waste?
What did you have for breakfast? Great fact sheet on healthy eating provided by the CDC shows that 39% of children ages 2-17 aren't getting enough daily fiber. (found primarily in dried beans and peas, fruits, vegetables, and you guessed it...whole grains) http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/nutrition/facts.htm
Thanks to EVERYONE who participated in the 30 Word Post challenge on Friday! You are all making an effort to help the earth from home, and that is something to be very proud of. We will be contacted those who posted in time for the deadline via direct message today and tomorrow (depends on fb) Thanks again!!!! www.bagthebox.com 
Did you know that over 1 billion overnight shipping boxes with shipping envelopes inside are used each year? If just 1% of those boxes were saved, it would be enough packaging for two holiday gifts for every child under the age of five in the US. www.BagtheBox.com

Family meals are a time to catch up and just be together, a time to connect. I remember the family meals of my childhood and hope that my kids treasure those memories as well!
I love all the Malt-O-Meal Hot Cereals they are good any time of the day especially when it is freezing cold outside!! Warms the heart and soul as well as the stomach and great tasting
My entire familiy LOVES Chocolate Malt-O-Meal, but it is becoming so hard to find!
Just got my coupon!! Guess who's going to get some deliciousness this weekend?? Pass over V-Day candy...I have...MALT-O-MEAL!!
Your Blueberry Spooner is better then "leading"ccompetor.. Also IN a way to waste less can you suggest to the shipping department to use smaller boxes for the product? honestly there alot of wasted space in the boxes which is sad seeing you guys wanting to reduce waste :(
Good pricing, great quality & quantity. Kids love em and I save $$
First start your day with mini-spooners! Then, spend Valentines Day with that special someone in your life. A nice quiet evening, dinner and wine. Remember to tell all your family how much you love them as well. Don't forget the soldiers who are fighting for our freedom!!!
Spend the day with your whole family. Make something special for dinner and have some fun with games. To top it all off, sit down and watch a good movie. 
I just cashed out my coupon for the biggest honkin' bag of mini-spooners Walmart had. Yum!

I participated in a Focus Group yesterday, and there was a couple other people who kept bringing up this film, and telling the egg assoc to stop the egg factories!
The problems we already face nowsuch as the warming atmosphere, water shortage, food scarcity, and desertificationwe can quickly eliminate by stopping meat production. Stop it now, no further! #Supreme Master Ching Hai
Leave it to McDonald's to screw up oatmeal!
Can someone tell me what are the other derivatives from Corn? The stuff companies use as a filler for everything under the sun. I am trying to avoid these products and see if I feel better. I have eliminated corn starch products and seem to be feeling much healthier. Anyone?
Know what I need? Cures for an absolute ADDICTION to breading. Something healthy.. Maybe still w/ bread crumbs?? Baked, perhaps?? HELP ME.
For Lunch Tomorrow Executive chef Giovanni Bouderbala Suggest: Valencia salad: oven baked yams with hard boiled egg white shredded grilled chicken breast green Spanish olives Italian parsley and tossed together with extra virgin olive oil.
um, just throwing it out there...anyone who goes to mcd's expecting any sort of healthy meal deserves to consume the 21 crap ingredients in their new oatmeal concoction...its not right, but it's a reality. there's no reason to delude ourselves...lol
For Dinner Tonight Chef Giovanni Recommends : Oven baked Chipotle Chicken Breast with a side of fire roasted butternut Squash
After watching this film, it's clear to me that new laws need to be put in place to protect the integrity of public appointments to government positions. Former corporate employees in salaried executive positions or board members or major donors to elected officials are prohibited from working in a paid public capacity as a matter of public safety and an inherent conflict of interest.
Can someone bring me up to date on Bill S 510 FDA Food Safety Modernization Act! I just became aware of this as someone shared it with me as I was posting about Farmers Markets and Community Gardens. Where is the Bill now and why weren't more people in the loop of how devastating this would be? I am currently trying to find recent info and keep finding articles from last year.
I just saw this film on my public access TV station this morning. It was a huge eye opener. Thank you. I am going to make serious changes in the foods I purchase and eat. 
Its amazing how much these companies are allowed to hide from us. This is not just about our food either..Your skin care, cosmetics, and health and wellness products are also contaminated. And ask yourself who "regulates" those.. 
I am going to start buying organic foods for my family, I dont think I can ever eat regular meat again, I wasn't a big fan of meat to begin with and after seeing this movie it is either organic or i dont want it.
The largest study of its kind has unexpectedly concluded that even very heavy, long-term cannabis users who had smoked more than 22,000 joints over a lifetime, a UCLA study clinical study confirms they "do not have any increase risk of cancer. In fact, What we found instead was no association at all, and even a suggestion of some protective effect." -UCLA Pulmonologist Donald Taskin http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-05-26/news/17294333_1_lung-cancer-marijuana-dr-donald-tashkin Free the Plant http://www.facebook.com/plantthelandhemp 
As well as in food there are so many harmful chemicals in toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo, soap, and the like. I mean the skin is the largest organ of the body so we should be careful what we put on it. And what we put on our skin can affect our whole body. For example, aluminum (which can be found in deodorants) has been shown to promote Alzheimer's disease. Some companies even put dioxins in their products. Dioxin was the main chemical in Agent Orange! Even talcum powder is shown to be harmful, research has shown that it is virtually chemically identical to asbestos! Another study found that even cosmetic grade talc caused tumors in animals! It is a carcinogen! Sorry to rant on a food page about personal care products but I believe that people need to know these things, and I felt this was a good first step to tell some people. You guys should make a documentary on these harmful products!
Tomorrow TakePart will chat with Deborah Krasner, author of "Good Meat: The Complete Guide to Sourcing and Cooking Sustainable Meat." What would you like to ask her?
Wow. I thought reading Pollan's books was enough. It's not. Nothing like visuals. This movie is a game-changer. Please watch if you haven't yet. Nothing sensational here, just truth.
My Chiropractor's office hosted a night out at the movies and "Food, Inc." was the subject. I had read both books that were the main subjects of the movie. Bottom line ... Buy Organic. Yes, it is more expensive. However, as I see it, you will buy less, therefore eat less, therefore loose weight. Sounds like there is a Chinese proverb here somewhere. Seriously, America, support your local growers at your Green Markets. Together, we can make a difference!

Attenion! Attenion! Attenion! Attenion! Attenion! Attenion! Attenion! Its here, and its big! ((I NEED YOU TO PASS THIS AROUND TO EVERYONE. WE NEED TO GET EVERYONE THINKING ABOUT THIS NOW. THIS NEEDS TO GET TO THE RIGHT HANDS NOW. PLEASE SHARE THIS!!! THIS KIND OF THINKING IS VERY DANGEROUS! PLEASE SHARE WITH EVERYONE YOU CAN!!!!! NOW!)) I have a proposal to make, but before I do, I would like you to listen for a brief moment to what I believe to be true: I would like for you to consider the possibility that the government is NOT in control of the people; that elected officials make NO decisions about laws, regulations, or issues any more than regular people on the street do. Consider the possibility that they may be just place-holders for corporations that are looking to use public policy, government funding, popular opinion and YOU to push their agendas. In order to consider this possibility, we must ask ourselves, Who are the most powerful forces that control what our government is governing? Now, here is my proposal: Consider one huge, world-wide CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST MONSANTO and other criminal corporations! ALL ACTIVISTS, All People, all nations in every state, on every island, on every continent, in every country around the world, ALL STARTING A LAWSUIT ON THE SAME DAY! Different countries have different laws, we can use that to our advantage. We can surround these corporations and attack them the exact same way they attack us! Every country, attacking the same company at the same exact time! THE WORLDS LARGEST LAWSUIT!!!!!! ALL Corporations, one at a time, starting with Monsanto! Thats right, let pull out resources and go after one corporation at a time, just one! Monsanto causes more ruin and destruction across the world than any other company. (Whales, fish, land, air, food, slavery, espionage and monopolies. They have people in the senate, the house as well as the white house the EPA, FDA, and USDA.! They make laws to protect themselves! Lets stop wasting time fighting and arguing with governments. Lets go after the source! What if we did stand together as ALL NATIONS OF THE WORLD and demand that they (the governments) separate themselves from corporations?! What if we force lawsuits on companies, and in those lawsuits, demand that they have to hand over all documents that relate to CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY! (Water Air and Land Pollution. Human testing, these would involve the chemicals you are fed, as well as the ones being poured everywhere on the planet.) What if we use real science to prove they have been conducting experiments against our will, and to prove they are using to poison to grow our food?! What if we demand these documents and bring the perpetrators to task, forcing the release of documents and proof of the intentional destruction of the planet, humans and control of the economy, by only a few, for the profit of those few? GOALS: Force Governments to separate themselves from corporations 1) If we have a world wide lawsuit, and everyone IS involved from around the world, governments will be forced to separate themselves from these corporations and stop hiding whats happening. It a very embarrassing situation for them. 2) To open the flood gates with lawsuits for the other companies on our list we will go after. Companies ride on the backs of other lawbreakers/makers; imagine all the companies who get by abusing the laws that protect them. If we, all those around the world take down one company for just one crime, imagine the fear all the other companies will feel. Imagine what they are also hiding. All these companies are linked in one way or another. All use the other to protect themselves. Lets use the laws that protect them to hunt them down! 3) To force corporate employees out of Government office. How can you investigate the company that pays you so handsomely if you work for the EPA, FDA, and USDA and the company you are supposed to be investigating? 4) To share information from country to country, person to person, lawsuit to lawsuit! 5) To stop crimes against humanity as one. I propose that we band together, (one cause, one goal) to knock the legs out from under the corporate interests that fund our government; those that keep us sick, poor and weak; those that continue to destroy the land, plants, animals, and oceans without regard. I propose that we fight standing - joining our resources, USING DIRECT CONFRONTATION UNDER THE BANNER OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. I call every activist, every person who has the inkling to stand, to add your voice. Instead of being small groups making small dents in issues of importance, we could get to the source and work our way across the planet. We could cause change, by forcing the hand of the corporate interests that have gone unaccounted for and use our numbers as our power. As we stand right now, we have millions of people who feel nothing is working! We are nothing but pieces of thread thrown all over the place. Little activists groups. What happens if we take all those pieces of thread and pile them up into one huge ball. We would be huge! We can roll through the walls or go right over them as one. We keep trying to fight using the same means that get us nowhere. Lets try something different,. Information can and will be shared between all our groups. Nothing will be held back. The most frustrating aspect of foraging forward to fight is that there are never enough people and resources to win. If you stand for the earth, native peoples, women, children, the ocean, the whales, forests, bats, fresh water, organic food, or ANY OTHER cause concerning life on this planet, consider WHY these are the primary sources for this destruction, and how much easier it would be to fight if we banded together. You are one voice, but if you add your voice to other voices, you become part of a choir. A choir is louder and much stronger than the soloist. As a soloist, I cannot do this by myself, but if we all join the choir if we all stand together, we will be louder, stronger and taller and they will have to listen! Lets look at big corporations as artists, who color pretty posters that depict how we would like to see our world. The government is the posters and advertisements. You see them everywhere, plastered on telephone poles and the sides of buildings; you turn on your t.v. or radio and there they are, going for the hard sell. Now, you may look at them and think that they are an eyesore and youd rather not look at them anymore so you paint over them. Sure, you (as one person) can paint over these posters - but look how many people had read, and believed the advertisements before you did. And when you do try to cover them up or beautify things, they just put another poster on top of the old one. What we need to do as one nation of the world, is to cut off the hands of the artist! Corporations are the arms and hands that create the posters and advertisements. Governments advertise beauty, purity, love, life and sharing, when they are none of these things. They are nothing but false advertising. They. Cover. The. Truth!!!!!! Governments create laws to hide behind and to protect big corporations from us. Thats right, TO PROTECT CORPORATIONS FROM US! There are no provisions for people being fed unlabeled contaminated food; there are no warnings when entering agricultural areas known to be highly contaminated with chemicals used in the growing of food; there are no consequences for the high nitrogen levels, a direct result of agricultural production that is destroying sea life, whales, coral, frogs the list goes on and on. Food and its production is the only common link between all people world-wide. Food and its production is an industry that has been used to: control establish wealth destroy land destroy air destroy water It is their way of subduing and eliminating populations, while keeping the rest of the world on the edge of poverty! In this effort, their offenses are many: they buy and sell our land, people, water and air as commodities, without asking our permission! Who gave them the power to do this? People are knowingly poisoned, intentionally fed food that causes the body to become ill; land is destroyed, and the ability to feed families taken; farmers are forbidden from collecting seeds and planting without chemicals. It is through food production that chemical contamination has reached the Gulf of Mexico, creating a dead zone that continues to expand. It is through food production that GMO seeds have begun to forcibly alter the ecological landscape of the planet, with ever increasing signs of causing devastating plant and animal diseases. It is the effects of these same seeds now starting to show signs of effect on humans in immune decline, organ dysfunction and even potentially increased risk of cancer. Yet, these same GMO foods are those being offered so generously to the poor world-wide as the solution to their rumbling bellies, while the producers of that food know that they are providing slow death and poison cloaked as salvation. And for those that have made efforts to shirk the yoke of corporate farms and GMO seeds, they find themselves sued, their land poisoned or taken; displaced and bankrupt for trying to take a stand. These are the same corporations with origins in the Second World War, where they tested their first chemical weapons on the Jewish people held in Concentration camps; who then used future generations of these chemicals over Vietnam dumping millions of gallons over jungles, causing current generations 35 years later to still have children born drastically malformed and sick. We stand at a pivotal moment in time, where it seems as if there are two groups of people; those that are sitting down and those that are standing up. We are beginning to see regular people decide to voice an opinion for causes spanning the spectrum and spanning the globe. The common theme is the desire for freedom from dictated rules, destruction, and inequality of people. However, due to the ever growing number of things to stand for, we stand thin; our numbers dictated by our passions and every cause has a just and true reason to be fought for. But what if, each of these fights, each of these causes, were part and parcel of the same source? What if we could, as one, could join, band, group and stand for all causes at the same time and win?!

Is partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil bad for you? It's in multi-grain saltine crackers.
Oprah today goes vegan and shows us where our meat comes from...check it out
OK I am now officially repulsed by the food available in my grocery and will only eat organic from now on... I can do this at home, but what about when I travel for my job. Is there a list of responsible restaurants I can refer to, because I surely do not want to support those who buy irresponsible food. I contacted Food Inc but the response did not answer my questions.
can you please tell me where to buy meat from that does not mistreat animals or inject them with bad stuff. i live in louisiana
I don't know about anyone else, but a special bulletin came on during Michael speaking and the show came back on when he was done talking. The next frame was the Cargill plant. Now I wanted to read what Michael had to say so I went to Oprah's page and it was written either. I just find it crazy how Michael was taken out and a picture was painted of a humane, almost kind slaughter house by the Cargill company?? Is this a coincidence?
I wish I had my own land...It would be near the ocean...with chickens and cows for fresh organic and raw milk and eggs and a huge garden that I would amuse myself in all day for fresh and organic fruits and vegetables what god intended us to eat....wait a minute it was all for free and abundant when my grand ma was alive and young,they had it all back then,what just happened to our generation? so sad as I'm walking through the grocery store and am looking for real food and I just can't find any )o:

Does anyone have an ideas for meals (not soup please) that include pinto beans. My youngest has acid reflex so I have to stay mild and not hot
Food, Inc. is amazing, but it made me think of something and I'm hoping someone on this page, a fan or whoever, can answer. Part of the movie pointed out that a lot of organic companies that started small have been bought out by big corporations. I personally buy Cascadian Farms all the time since it is more affordable but I know (at least I think I know) they are owned by General Mills. Does anyone who is well studied in this field know if, once companies are bought out by larger corporations, their quality and standards fall? I know they still have the USDA Organic stamp, but I think this movie shows us why it is legit not to trust the Government to protect us. I just worry that by buying bigger name organic products, I'm really not buying something that is that much safer. 
 I know they still have the USDA Organic stamp, but I think this movie shows us why it is legit not to trust the Government to protect us. I just worry that by buying bigger name organic products, I'm really not buying something that is that much safer. I'd love to buy local, but this area is extremely limited in options, but I am working on it. I'd appreciate any feedback. My husband and I are really trying to commit ourselves to this, but we want to make sure we start out right, and it's not easy when everyone you know is telling you you're wasting your money (i.e. they think all our food is safe and Mickey D's is the best thing ever) :) 
Tammy Thompson Scary happenings in schools regarding food; currently they force people to buy their junk foods to raise money for school needs; Kraft & Exxon Mobil (illegally dumped toxins in Will County ILL & made many people sick) are telling schools in order to make more money place their corporate ads on buses & kids lockers! WT...HECK?!!! FYI our daughter's doctor referred to Kraft, General Mills, etc. foods to be crack in a box. Also so many are sick that live near these facilities & major players are oil & coal companies.

Thank you for making this Documentary! I think it's one of the most important eye opening movies ever made. Needs to be seen by everyone!
Do restaurants have to specify whether they are using GMO meats? 
I read this today on a website for a local farm. I like it and thought it deserved being shared (even if its been done so) "Sunlight nourishes the grasses and grains, the plants nourish the animals, the animals then nourish the soil, which in turn nourishes the next season's grasses and grains." -Micheal Pollan 
I just watched the documentary tonight and WOW! Interesting & important information. I'll be sharing it with everyone I know without a doubt. 
I have just purchased my 3rd copy of this movie (I keep lending it out for friends to watch and pass on). My question is ~ How do I get permission to have a showing of this Movie at my YMCA? I would like to share it with the masses. I want to get this very important message to as many people as I can.

"Does adding vitamins really make a food better for you? Real foods ARE health foods and do not need to be made functional to be good for you. They are functional just they way they are." - Marion Nestle
The US Government is looking for a battle. If things get out of hand, there will be an uprising. It's not right or justified to control our food, to control the land that was purchased honestly by innocent people purely motivated by greed. Monsanto will become a part of history. They WILL go bankrupt and cease to exist, should they continue to move in the floundering and negative direction they're headed. 
Just watched Food, Inc. on Netflix! This is a MUST SEE! What a catalyst for change!! Thank you to all who were part of making this movie a reality. I recommend it to everyone! 
i just watched this show. every appaling :( i had to stop the film when i say the pigs get electricuded. and i was astounded by cows having holes in their stomaches. i cried. i cant believe what kind of people we have become. 
Got a letter from my daughter's school that the fed gov & state are requiring better nutrition in school & more physical activity in order to continue to receive funding. the program put in place told parents & students what we can't bring to school, like junk food & pizza etc..the issue I have, the school lunch menu still consists of Pizza, hot dogs etc..and phys ed is down to once a week, way to fix a problem!
watched the movie just now. Very mind boggling but its a good thing to be informed nevertheless

I just wanted to say a big THANK YOU for making this film. 7 months ago without seeing this film I decided to eat vegetarian, that was the first step. Now thanks to everyone involved in Food Inc. I plan to grow my own garden in the summer and buy from farmers markets. PS: love Food Rules! Thank you, Thank you, THANK YOU!
Who was that VA farmer with grass feed beef? 
its decided no more meat for this gal! 
So the House is considering cuts that may furlough federal inspectors in slaughter and processing plants. No prob, I can stop eating beef until inspectors return. Too bad for any loss of confidence in American beef products on export markets.
I am French and I just come to see the movie. I am shocked to see these outstanding animals, these farmers reduced to the silence, these diseases which the overproduction engenders... Regrettably, I am afraid that in France we arrive at the same report in a few years... I try in my personal ladder to eat local products or from my garden but I have to recognize that I sometimes eat also to Mc Donald's 
Anyone have a "Health Master" high power appliance blender? Montel is promoting it on the Living Well show and selling for $200+ shipping/handling. It crushes all the vegetables and makes a juice. And they say people loose weight and improve stamina. Appreciate your comments.
I just want to say that I wish something could be done about our district and their choices for our children's foods. I am a teacher and when I go to the cafeteria, the ladies are frustrated and powerless to make good choices for our students. All decisions are made at a district level and I am horrified at what is offered to our students. And then they are expected to pay attention and learn in class. It is disgraceful. Especially for the children who's parents believe their children are being fed healthy meals at school, so they do not feed them at home. And for those families who cannot feed their children breakfast and lunch from home. :(
I thought this group is about bringing people together with a common goal, not to fight. I wonder why Food Inc keeps posting the meatless Monday posts given all the negative responses it receives?
Are organic foods GMO free? I have been trying to figure this out
I have a food Inc.video and i am showing it to my friends for their awareness on what's going on in our food industry...thanks for site , it will keep us updated of our health ... thanks for sharing the information:)

We need to have County wide monthly meetings and get this news out! bringing together organic farmers, school leaders, local public... we need speakers!
Thank you to all those responsible for the life-changing documentary, FOOD, Inc..You have gratly influenced changes for me, since I first watched (reinforced on 2nd, 3rd viewings).Since last Spring, I have lost 55 lbs.(Since I don't have health insurance, I finally went to doctor's office yesterday & was overjoyed with weight loss...).I only buy antibiotic-free meats, poultry & eggs.Avoid GM foods, buy organic fruits & vegetables (TASTE so good!), and lower pesticide produce.Can't wait for Farmer's Markets to re-open in the Northeast.Please keep educating us!I will continue to enjoy less food that is vastly higher in quality & nutrients, while "voting with my dollar".My local Shop-Rite has been adding/increasing choices.So grateful to FOOD, Inc.!
Now would be a great time to remind people about registering with thier local CSA. Early registration is available for some now and the spaces are filling up fast. Some of our local farms have already filled up thier spots! I got a good one though ;) and good discount for registering early.

No os centris slo en Estados Unidos, haced que se expanda hasta Europa el hacernos saber cmo se "fabrica" la comida y cmo nos la hacen comer. Realmente es muy fructfera la informacin que facilitis gracias a vuestro esfuerzo e inquietudes. Podis o DEBIS poner en la TV ms veces el mismo documental. No basta con verlo una vez, hay que concienciar muy seriamente a la poblacin de lo que est sucediendo y de lo mal que repercute en nuestra salud, en la de nuestros hijos e incluso en el planeta por la cuestin de los patgenos y bacteras "creadas" manipulando a los animales que comemos.
Does anyone find that organic egg shells tend to shatter more than non-organic ones?
Just watched this movie for the first time ever...... and I am shocked and can't believe how long i have been eating fast food burgers.... i feel ashamed. 
anything to be concerned about with your local fruits and veges? Why is food so damn expensive in northern arkansas?? what a joke.... Ok, can't wait to move back to arizona at the end of March... it sucks here.
Just watched Food Inc. with a group of friends (my second viewing). Please help us all find ways to fight back against the huge corporations that put profit above all else.... (ways in addition to not buying factory farmed food)
I went to the London Screening of Food Inc that Stella McCartney sponsored & had our children watch it too (8 & 10). They have now convinced their school to do Meat Free Mondays & have been telling all their friends to watch Food Inc! A GREAT film.
Can some one tell me where I can look to see exactly what is feed to the chickens that are sold at Whole foods 
Just watched this movie last night; and can I say "wow, scary stuff!" I'm going to find local grass fed beef, organic poultry farms and shop the local farmer's markets from now on! Luckily, we have a lot available around here in Western Washington. We're also going to expand our vegetable garden this year!
Great documentry...I'm happy I don't eat meat and eat organically.I always shop at my local farmers market and henerys <3 love n light...plant the seed <3
i just watched the movie for the first time yesterday and upset by all the corrupt practices by the food industry especially monsanto. i happened to look them up and see all over the internet that whole foods, stonyfield, & organic valley are not in opposition any longer, and support the use of ge'd alfalfa. what's really going on here?? 
After watching this move, I feel sad.
Been off beef and chicken for a year now and all because of this movie. I get the cravings, but knowing what happens now makes it easy to look for better choices. Go fake meat!!!
Just had my 8 and 12 year old watch this movie. They are inspired to make better choices and pass the knowledge on. 
I read Pollen's book and have just watched Food Inc.. I live in France, and my neighbor's dairy cows eat grass... but WHAT am I eating from the supermarket? ugh...

Hello my name is April Morgano and I have to say this movie has moved my 16 year old son. So he asked me if I had ever seen the movie and I said no. He then found it on our cable provider and I watched it. I found this movie moving and found my favorite company Monsanto in this movie. I love them and their seeds..NOT. I am the founder of 2 Let It Bee: The Honey Bee Revitalization Project and the Monsanto Co, is one company that will know my name in the near future.
Watching this is life changing. At least it should be. Our family will be going organic.
In my political science class at shasta college the students had the opportunity to watch Food,Inc. Among many other issues within the United States political system, our GOVERNMENT is among one of the most contraversal debates facing american citizens today. Now i understand why i feel nauseated from eating chicken breasts and ground beef. I have begun to make positive changes and better choices in my life eating habits and FULLY SUPPORT local farmers,farmers markets and well ALOT MORE VEGGIES!! To plant my own garden would be very smart and beneficial to my health and the community i live in. As for animal abuse in the food industry, well i'll comment on that another time!!! In short- NOT COOL. May god help all believers make better choices and do what is right and justly. 
I prefer to eat at home because of so many good reasons. Not least I know the crockery is clean so hasn't been contaminated, the food is organic and i know exactly everything I'm ingesting. Also, quite important to me too is knowing my food is prepared with love and it's in harmony with the seasons instead of being put together in a stressed out kitchen with sweaty people manhandling it - yuk! Dawn
Finally watched the movie a few months ago, changes for me had already started to happen for myself and family. My husband just went a long with because I purchase and prepare our foods so he really didin't have a say. Then he watched the movie....I must say it has made him think more about what he consumes and where it comes from. 
From the page of a small dairy. "Lisa is in the other room, writing the check to TDSHS. They charge dairies $.015 per 100 Lbs of milk processed. Or $5.00, whichever is higher. SO, for the month of January we paid $5.00. If we paid the actual charge that a large dairy would pay, it would have come out at $.018 instead of the $5.00 we had to send them."
I begin my shopping at the local farmers market and then fill in with grocery store organic food. I am sooooooo much heallthier! I canned/froze veggies this past summer - first time in 25 years!~ I intend to put up twice as much this sumer as I did last year.
my Ben and Jerrys ice cream is Fair Trade Certified. =D Now ill feel good eating it
Upstate SC is doing a great job of providing fresh, local meat, poultry, dairy and produce.....and we tilled the garden this past weekend--getting ready for cool season crops to go in--yipee!
wow, I just finished watching this movie. I am shocked and horrified. People need to get on this right now. I just went to the grocery store last night and I want to return most of my food. I am going to plant a tiny garden on my apt. balcony and spread the word! Poor Moe, being dragged to court like that!
I would like to thank Food INC. After viewing your movie I became vegetarian immediately, with the help of a vegetarian friend. Thank you for the opportunity to give myself and my young child a healthy lifestyle and future!!!! :)

Then, ask your friends to vote for your picture here on Facebook. The picture that gets more votes wins!!! http://xrl.us/bifff9
I was getting tired of voting in the game cave contest, but after seeing some of the really negative, accusing posts, I'm back up and voting every day. 
Vote#674 for the Wolf's Den. Beth & Kerry are some of the best people you'll ever meet. It's an honor to call them my friends. They're kind, HONEST, hardworking, and they have heart. Go Wolf's Den!
Making negative comments and false accusations against other contestants in a contest is not the way to win votes. The game cave contest is about voting for the coolest game room - Wolf's Den is over the top. I will be back to vote again tomorrow. Go Wolf's Den. 
Check it out! If you missed out on the first spa giveaway, you have another chance! http://bit.ly/aOd1d4 Enter our Heart Healthy Sweepstakes for a chance to win a spa getaway to Grove Park Inn!
Game Cave is not user friendly!!!!! If I wasn't related to the people who are doing it I wouldn't even vote because it is so tidious to do!!!!!
As a voting shopper in this contest, I would like to say that the Wolf's Den is the best Man Cave ever! It is special because many, many friends and neighbors worked on the construction. It has brought us all together...men and women love to hang out there. We have birthday parties, races, NFL games, concerts, holidays and more in the Game Cave. But, we all appreciate the Wolf's Den because Beth and Kerry are the best hosts ever. It is about the people who go there! It is true...everyone knows your name!!! 
Personally, I like the contest because it is in keeping with the age old tradition of competitive sports and comradery. There is nothing better than being in the Wolf's Den with all of our friends, cooking up our favorite foods (from Lowes), and watching the big game(whatever it is). Our neighborhood has been in the paper for its heart and its interesting residents. The Game room is about more than the room...it is about the people who are in it and the great times that take place there over a great pot luck, celebration, sports, or just because!
Game Cave Contest Winner!!! With more than 1000 votes, the winner of the Game Cave Contest is the Wolf's Den. Congratulations!!! Thanks to all who participated. You all have great Game Caves!! We will contact the winner soon to coordinate prize delivery. -Diana.
Awesome on winning the game cave contest Lowes Food - Thank you. :) Can you give me some idea of the date/time you intend to call me so I will be sure not to miss your call? VERY much appreciate the opportunity to enter this contest and receive so many votes. Wow - the response was overwhelming - not to mention I brought 85 new friends to Lowes Foods page and no telling how many others from other friends who were voting - that rocks for business for Lowes Foods so we both win - gotta love that.

Check out the new Erewhon Cocoa Crispy Brown Rice packaging... kinda makes you want a bowl for a mid-day snack, huh?
When I was a kid, my mom used to make muffins out of Uncle Sam cereal. We would eat them straight out of the oven with home made butter on them. When I got older and moved away, I couldn't find it in any grocery store near us, would have to travel 100 miles to find it. Just seeing the box gives me memories of home and mom.
Today's most RT comment from our #attune chat: "I look at the ingredient list b4 nutrition info." - do you do this too?
Hello. I just have one more question if you don't mind. Does the company label for other allergens run on the same like say as the Crispy Brown Rice and the Cocoa Crispy Brown Rice cereals ( especially concerned for nut allergens ). Thank you for all of your help.

would you ever consider being more open about "natural flavors" on the ingredients list? My son has multiple food allergies and I tried to find out what was on the Chocolate cripy cereal and could not get an answer. Would love to have more choices for my son and others like him. At this point we can only use the plain crispy cereal. Thank you.
Here's my tip on how to eat allergy free: do your research!! Go to the grocery store when you have time to read all the labels. Also, go on the internet and find recipes for all your favorite foods. There are so many ways to make your own allergy free food! Just last night, I baked a Caitlin-friendly red velvet cake! If you spend some time looking into alternatives, you can eat well and live well at the same time!!
Erewhon Rice Twice with organic whole milk is my favorite snack!! It is INSANE how quickly I go through a box!!
Sprinkle ground flaxseed on cereal and into muffin recipes, and stay away from partially hydrogenated oils - which is tough to do.

LOVE YOUR GRILLS!!!!!! Can't imagine life w/o them. Thank you George!
I have a grilled fruit sandwich every morning with coffee. Mr Forman i tell you all you need is the fruit and bread. Nothing else. Apple and cinnamon on raisin or cinnamom swril makes a great breakfast. Almost any fruit works for me . These grills are the bum.
I wish the newer grills were better engineered than they were. My original grill was great, and I could rinse it off without worrying about water runoff. SOME of the newer ones do not have grill overlap, and as such, leaked grease and water that was not captured in the lower grill plate...I've since discarded the newer grill and gone back to the original....faulty non-stick coating and all........Wake up, George...Your marketers have improved your product in the wrong direction, and I will be unlikely to replace what I have with the "improved" versions...There are more functionally appropriate appliances available...
GOOD MORNING MR. FOREMAN. dwight cavaness.
Are there any of your grills available that do not have that non-stick coating? I'm willing to put some extra care into cleaning mine than deal with that coating. 
RECIPE: Fresh Mozzarella & Proscuitto Panini
Love your grill you are a mad genius. The food is so healthy and just looking at the drip tray and thinking that could be in me? Man your brilliant!!!!
It's quick, it's easy, it's lean, it doesn't make a big mess. Easy to clean if you plug it back in and get it hot after its been sitting for days. It's storable. Hey just read your book By George and your quite THE MAN. God Bless you and your family. Your sister in Christ, Cindy. I like to throw Hamburgers on it when I don't feel like cooking oh yea, onions and mushrooms to go with the burgers. Yummy.
I just made the best steaks ever!!!!
sweet potatos marinated in lemon, fresh ginger and cinnamon and pears in ground ginger grilled its yummy

Glad you got finally ur money 2 Shara,sorry 2hear it came up $300 short,mine went all in full amount just as i was told,congrats on ur upcoming family addition also...
We filed on the 14th and our refund should have been on our emerald card today. We still don't have it. I called the card company and they told us that it was scheduled to post today. If I don't have it by tomorrow then I need to call the IRS. I just got off the phone with the IRS and they said it could be another 3 WEEKS! I can't understand why. We never have any problems in the past and have no offsets. Is there anything we can do? 
It's sad that the irs is capable of blowing us off with out a mere apology. All were being told is that it's an internal error. Yet if you owe the irs they come after you with audits,garnishment, levies even federal jail time.not to mention compounds of intrest. At the very least we should get a valet answer of what's the cause of the "internal error" and apology to it's cosumers. Wow, i feel like a faithfull woman betrayed by her thouughless husband.
Was seriously thinking about using HR Block next year, but after reading all of these horror stories, I think I will stick with Turbo Tax, although I do like the fact that HR Block has people to help you in this forum.
I had to file a dual-state return because I live in NY and go to school in PA, and have jobs in both states. I was super confused by this, and I had seen commercials for H&R Block, so I figured why not go there. The lady at H&R Block who helped me was amazing... Friendly, considerate, and super helpful. She helped me get credit back that I normally wouldn't have known how to get back myself, and even consulted with a higher up on what way to file to get me more money - which took her an extra half an hour. I am TOTALLY appreciative of everything she did. I hope this balances out all of the horror stories; don't be afraid to choose H&R block just because of them!

Know the difference - An injured spouse may get relief when the IRS withholds a joint refund due to debts or obligations of the other spouse. An innocent spouse may be eligible for relief when the other spouse makes false reports on a joint return.
IRA and Retirement-Plan Penalties - If you don't follow the plan rules, you might receive a penalty for contributing too much money in a year, withdrawing money too soon, or failing to withdraw funds by the required minimum distribution date.

so i called hrblock they said my dd was sent to my bank yesterday and gave me the exact amount so now im calling my bank
I will never use hr block again. When we filed I told the lady my husbands name went first she did something in the computer and assured me that my name was first and filed it that way. Just called the irs as my money wasn't in the bank like they said it would be. Turns out since she put my name first the irs has to switch the accounts putting a two to three week delay on my refund. Grrrrr
just got my refund on my card! thanks!! woo hoo!
OK - Just contacted HR Block (Bank) at their 800 number (800-472-5625). I spoke with a very nice representative (Ferran) and she said to wait until about noon for direct deposits/Emerald Card deposits. She was VERY nice and helpful! She said that the refunds are scheduled to be released at noon - and to call back if I don't see it by then. THANKS FERRAN! Great Customer Service!
I have been a H&RBlockehead for 12 years now. I am wondering why I never new about the free filing at the website. My return was fairly simple and I could have done this online for free. Instead I paid $282, I know this helps pay salaries,but If you were the person preparing my taxes and heard my situation, as my preparer did, you would have made a better sugestion.....it's the human factor that counts. Especially when you are talking about the cost of 2 weeks worth of groceries....
OK when I filed my taxes I was not told they didn't have a same day option until we were done. That made me mad. Then we were told it would be the 11th. Its not here yet. Then we were charged an outrageous price for filing. If we don't get our return today I think H&R block should refund some of our filing fees!
OMG i cant afford to be on hold any longer just to eat my day time mins!!!!!!!!! Give me my money like i was told i would have it cause my bank does not hold it i have already talked to them they say you have NOT sent it thru!!!!
If the H&R people post that "direct deposit..funds available by the 15th" copy and paste post one more time....I'm gonna SCREAM!
JUST GOT MY MONEY!!!!
This is the first year I have done DD to my bank and I do not see why I have to wait any longer than people who got the Emerald Card or people who received a check! Had I known I would have to wait longer I would have just had it deposited on the Emerald Card! This is crap and I am pretty sure that I will not be using H&R Block again!!!
This IS an H&R block PROBLEM!! I have talked with SEVERAL people that used TurboTax, and other tax people. THEY HAVE THEIR MONEY! and they had their taxes done AFTER me! I want my 280$ back they took to do my taxes! This is redicilous!! Some people DEPEND on this money being deposited on the days they say it will! I have talked with my bank several times, and they keep telling me...nothing has been posted yet. UGH!! I have used H&R block for SEVERAL years, and I will never again!!
WOW! I feel so bad for everyone getting screwed by hr today! Seems like some kinda scam to make u want an em. card! I went to jh (tried for ral: denied) but as soon as irs released last night, it went to their bank, they got their fees, and it was IMMEDIATELY DD IN MY ACCOUNT! HR give these ppl their $ already!
Everyone, the only way we can truly get any justice is to go somewhere else next year. Turbo Tax here I come!!!! Everyone I know that used them got their money today. H&R Block doesn't care if they lose a few customers, but at least we'll have the satisfaction of knowing they're not getting our money!
Dear H&R Block..how did we get to this situation? you have many ANGRY dd customers today. we know from reading the page that you rewarded the emerald card and check in office customers. we also know the IRS gave you are money last night. we feel lied to, cheated, and disrespected. i am very upset and will do everything to make sure this does not happen again. if that means new legislation from congress, then so be it. the proper thing to do would be to admit your mistakes and correct it --with regret---
Just called my bank....they dont see any transactions pending from H & R block nor from the IRS....she also told me i am the 3rd person she's had to call and ask that smh...
I just got off the phone with the IRS. They said that my money has been released BUT they didnt dd to my account THEY said that it went to H&R Block. So when will I GET The Money in my account. This is getting crazy my money is 2 weeks late. WHATS GOING ON?????
I understand why ppl are upset about not getting their money, I would be too!! but it's NOT h&r blocks fault... ALL they do is FILE your taxes they don't control the money part ~just saying~
The IRS has notified us that your tax refund is ready to be transferred to H&R Block Bank. As a result, H&R Block Bank has initiated the process to deposit your Simple Pay proceeds* into your bank account. This process is usually completed within 2-3 business days but could take additional time, depending on your bank's direct deposit process. Check with your bank to confirm the deposit. H&R Block can't be held liable for the exact date of deposit of your refund. Confirm that your refund has been deposited into your bank account prior to using these funds. *Simple Pay proceeds are your federal refund minus the tax preparation program and refund account fees, as well as any additional withholdings, if applicable. Thanks for choosing H&R Block. 
so heres my question. why does it take a few seconds to transfer money from one of my accounts to another, but it is going to take H&R block 5 days to transfer my money into my account from their bank? and another thing. i posted questions about the refund and simple pay on the "get it right" section of the H&R website and ever person said it would be deposited today by 1pm even when i did use simple pay. it is not MY banks fault. and one more thing. i was actually told over the phone by a rep that it was due to monday being a holiday. LOL.. Valentines day? really? 
For all of u that have not received their dd yet. If ur banks system updated before hrblock bank sent them the dd it will not show up now until the next time ur banks system update. The only way to know when that will be is to call ur bank. Mine updates 2 times daily. It wouldn't even show that it is pending. 
I am not complaining but I did call my bank to check on this so called processing delay, and I was told that they don't even show a deposit that was made! They also said that once they got the funds they would go straight into my account! I have been a patient and understanding Client but I am starting to wonder just what is really going on! There are so statements that are being made that are untrue and I would like to know as adults why can't we know what's going on with our money?
I do believe any and everyone has a right to say what and how they feel on here as long as its respectful. Therefore I am not sure why some of you are judging others because they want their money. If it was you would be as hot as some of them are! We all know it's tax time but we also know that we want to trust and believe what people say, and when things don't happen that way we get upset. Therefore let people say what they feel without judging them!
There is still hope. My brothers just posted to his acct. We use the same bank. It DOES come in as an ARCH DRAFT. Our bank updated at 3est. 
hmmm i have used hr block for 16 years and this year just broke me i will never use this scam of a place again they tell you one thing and then you find out they lied they tell ya that your deposit takes 1 to 2 days to process but i have several friends that work at the bank and that is a lie as well oh and i forgot they charge you the same amount for a rac as they used to for the ral and then you call them and you cant understand the person you talk to anyways that is my 2 cents and i hope when the attorney general gets ahold of them they wont scam anyone else
Yeah well this card is a SCAM...when you use the card it will charge you for each transaction...our meal was 43.67. They took 57.44 off my card for this meal! I understand some fees BUT Jesus a 14$ fee just for using the card????? I have been a loyal client for 17 years BUT I will never use H&R Block or Emerald Card again.The combination of the 2 costed me almost 600.00 this year! when I could have just filed it on my own and had it deposited to my bank and NOT paid all those stupid fees......thanks for the rip-off H&R!!!!!
I am soooo disappointed in H & R block. i filed my taxes on january 27th, and now they are saying maybe tuesday! i will never, ever, ever file my taxes with them again and i will tell everyone who will listen about my experience with H & R! if i would have been told this from the beginning i would have went elsewhere. they know many would have turned away and that's where all of the deceit came from!!!! man o man
IRS monies are released the say day the WMR status changes. that would have been last wednesday. H&R you have had my money since wednesday.. it is friday.. this is making me believe the reports online that you are keeping tax payers money to earn interest in your new bank.. so not only are you making us wait longer for OUR money, you charge a hefty fee (extra for simple pay, efile payment, and not to mention the 34.99 for filing state which you are now saying you cant file) but you are also making more money off us by making us wait? wow.. and i thought the irs was bad. LOL
Yes the irs did send dd out wednesday when their system updated. Then on thursday when hrblocks bank system updated they received the dd. Then finally on friday hrblock bank sent out dd to ur bank. U will see them when ur banks system updates. Does anyone else but me see the pattern that it has to go thur. 
thanks HR block I just got my money DD to my bank it took a while but I got it
just going to say this if it was going to take me 3 our 4 days longer to get my refund i would have taken my business else where and probly will next year when i file u guys got my refund by today and here i have to wait till monday our tuesday if not longer this is a big joke
I was wondering when I will get my money direct deposited to my account? It should have been today the IRS already cleared it, and my bank doesn't hold it. So I'm just waiting on you H&R! Let me know because I NEED it!
I just spoke with Chase and the lady said that DD are the exception to there updating system and they show up in your acct as soon as they receive them! She also said that they process on Sat. to so it may be there tomorrow as well! 
H&R...you guys are dealing with many unhappy people.....not your fault! Times are tuff....I have used your services for many years and have received prompt great service, even this year even though my refund was not here today :( Those of you that are freaking cause you already wrote checks when your money was not in the bank yet, SHAME ON YOU! That's your fault!

Wish I could share something different, a positive experience, but I can't! Talk about being mislead! First, I wasn't told there was no RAL this year until AFTER the paperwork was done... Then, I was told I WOULD have my money TODAY if a did direct deposit.... But guess what... NO MONEY! Now, I am finding out that it may not be until the 15th because MY bank may hold funds? Ummm... NOT! The bank holding funds is HR BLOCK BANK! .... The IRS said my funds were deposited TODAY! My HR BLOCK Tax Agent said I WOULD have MY money TODAY! So where IS MY MONEY????
Just got an email and text message saying they JUST sent my refund to my bank, just now at 7:00pm on a FRIDAY NIGHT so I KNOW I won't get it til Monday or Tuesday...smh. never again will I file with h&r block. Sorry... 
So I'm reading these posts, and I will admit I felt the same way earlier today. Like many of you, I was told my return was deposited today. But when I got to the bank, it wasn't there. I did my taxes on handrblock.com (which is wonderful)...and I had to pay for my state tax prep. So h and r block is taking only 60 dollars out of my refund. The IRS isn't going to cut them a check to pay for it. Of course not. So its understandable that my return be deposited into THEIR bank so they can take the money they are owed, then they will deposit the remainder of my return into my bank account. How else would they get their money from my return? If you really think about it, it makes perfect sense. 
Just wanted to give my 2 cents on this whole direct deposit debacle. H&R Block is not the middle man between the IRS and your bank. When the IRS releases your refund to your bank it is between IRS and your bank. It does not go IRS then to HR Block and then to your bank. Also, I don't think H&R Block knows exactly what time of the day you will receive your return, it's between the IRS and how your bank does business (our direct deposits are ready 1st thing in the morning, one person I know does not have it available til the end of that business day- with the same company we're working for and payroll company). H&R Block is given the same timeline as any other person who does their own taxes or other tax companies, and it is given by the IRS, 8-15 days after it was accepted by the IRS. I also have a "no hold direct deposit policy" bank, yet last year when my return was directly deposited it did take my bank 3 days before they released it. 
ok so my comment got deleted because someone apparently has a problem with HONESTY .... WOW!!! Thanks H&R ..... now go get my money and REALLY send it to my bank!!!! :) NEVER EVER AGAIN WILL I, FAMILY OR FRIENDS use the poorest tax preparers EVER!!! looking back thru all these comments its also apparent it's not just me that feels disgusted, looks like H&R is robbing everybody!!! 
Just got my money! :) I guess my bank posted @ midnight (11 central)
YOU KNOW I HAVE NOTICED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SO QUICK TO SAY THAT H&R ISN'T ANSWERING THEIR QUESTIONS, BUT IF PEOPLE WOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THE QUESTIONS ALREADY BEING ASKED AND LISTEN CAREFULLY WHEN THEY ARE EXPLAINED SOMETHING, OR EVEN READ WHAT THEY ARE SIGNING THEN MAYBE THIER WOULDN'T BE SO CONFUSED!!! JUST SAYIN!
As a preparer for H&R Block I can only speak for my office. We inform every client that dd is dependant on individual banks. If you choose a RAC and if you look at the bottom of the funding chart given to you the second line clearly states that dd can take extra days. I believe if you read any print given to your from your bank it would tell you the same thing. It is not unusual for banks to not post a dd for 24 hrs. or longer. The problem everyone had yesterday was not because of H&R Block. H&R Block provided the service that you the client requested and we can only give you the dates that we are given from the IRS. Glad everyone got their money, I"m anxious to see how many calls we receive today apologizing for all the screaming, yelling, and cussing the we received yesterday. We tried to explain to everyone yesterday that their money was at their bank and would be posted at the banks disgretion.
FAQs and Answers on filing status, exemptions and dependents http://bit.ly/gsfU3w
I am, as my English friend Jaine says, "gobsmacked" (stunned beyond belief) after spending about 45 minutes reading through all the posts. Does ANYONE have patience anymore? Anything can happen ...and its not necessarily HRB's fault (and No I don't work for them). I know from my unemployment that if money is released first thing Monday morning I NEVER see the money before Wed., and in one case it was the FOLLOWING week (that was a "one-off" situation I guess). And if there is a holiday, banks don't always do processing on that day. HRB Fees? Seems there is the base fee and then you are charged for every piece of paper they process. There's no way they can tell you in advance what the final fee will be until the end. They could "guesstimate" the fee. (continued)
Just got off the phone with my bank. When I asked them why my funds were not deposited yesterday, they said "You went through H&R Block didn't you?" LOL She said everyone who went through H&R Block didn't get there's. Nice....
You could get money quickly and conveniently with an H&R Block Bank Refund Anticipation Check. You could get up to $9999 FAST with a Federal RAC and pay nothing out of pocket at the time of your tax preparation. A Federal RAC offers you a convenient way to receive money faster than a mailed federal refund check from the IRS when H&R Block prepares and electronically files your taxes. Receive the balance of your refund, minus fees, on an H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard2, Direct Deposit or check in approximately 8 to 15 days from IRS acceptance of your efiled tax return. guess the last sentence from thier website about rac is misleading and needs to be update. 
Your tax refund was direct deposited on February 11, 2011!!!! Thats from the WMR funny thing is I DONT HAVE MY MONEY!!!! ANd its still not showing! I just hope it is by tomorrow morning!
We did our taxes on January 29. We were told that we would get our direct deposit 8-15 days. We still have not received anything. We called yesterday now they are telling us that it may take another week or 2. We received an email the day that we did our taxes that everything was accepted. They did not give us really any explanation just that we would have to wait. 
Ok I have posted many times about this but now hubbys former employer say he mailed off the W2's today after playing games since the 22nd of Jan... I am hoping he is telling thetruth, if not I will have to get help from the IRS, now will he just get off scott free for doing this??? What happens if all I end up with is the last check stub??? I know this sounds childish but I hope he get some sorta penalty for this crap!!!
The IRS wheres my refund has updated so if you are wanting to get info about the status of your refund you can check it out :) I got my dd date for Friday so I am happy that there are no delays with my return... come on Friday :)
when i check the hr block wheres my return it says they have no info about my ss number but the irs one says they have recieved my return? i filed on the 11 for dd on emerald card just dont know why hr block has no info

A shout out (and apology) to Mr. Gene Luszcz. I would eat my way across Gene's Sausage Shops sprawling expanse of edible nirvana before I set foot in the hundreds of places that are more quickly recalled as being outstanding in their class. From the cured meats to the dried sausage and the amazing choice of pickles and side dishes, I think Genes is in a league of their own. 
Thoughts from my trip to Madagascar (show airs Tues., Feb 8 @ 9pm E/P on Travel Channel). Most days, I think I work harder than anyone else I know, but meeting Jama certainly put things into perspective.

Yesterday I went to order my weekly Cheeseburger pizza only to find out that they have discontinued it for this year! I can't tell you how disappointed I was as I have been having one of those pizzas every week :( Are menu changes dictated by customer demand? How can we get this pizza back on the menu?

My coupon window popped up, but neither of my coupons printed. I just got a Thank You for printing. ???
I tried to print your couplon and then right after I installed the coupon printer to my computer it gave me a message saying "sorry you have already printed this coupon". Question how did I print a coupon if I did not have the coupon printer installed???
I got that same message. I ve never tired to print this coupon before. that is very misleading. very disapointed.
Got a message that there are no prints left for the coupon. This is the first time I have been to your fan page, so I know I didn't print it already. Are you going to re-offer it?
I just "liked" your page to receive the $1.25/1 coupon, but when I followed the link to coupons.com, I received the message that there were no more prints available!
Trying to print the coupon and I'm receiving a message "There are no prints available for this campaign. You may close this window" Any help would be appreciated
I recieved a message "sorry there are no prints available"... I'm dissapointed too. If you are out of coupons deleat the offer. 
CA Pizza Kitchen, If there are no longer coupon prints available for the campaign, wouldn't the professional thing to do be removing the coupon link from you page with a nice little note that it will be available again soon? Bad PR. 
So disappointed there were no coupons. The deal was just posted on the blogs this morning. Not very nice, CPK.
Due to dietary restrictions and allergies, this is the only kind of pizza we've found my kids can have. :( Was Really looking forward to that coupon! :(
I liked your page so I could try your frozen pizza with the coupon. It says "There are no prints available for this campaign." Please fix!!
Wish you had coupons for your salads while dining in your restaurant!!!
Grocery BBQ Chicken is my teenagers favorite...thank goodness you have them at Costco as he eats the whole thing himself!
my my my.....I just love these companies who make you jump through hoops and then give you nothing.....NOT!
Whoa people....calm down! It's a coupon, that will be available again sometime soon! I can't believe how people get so worked up over such a simple, soon to be remedied issue. Aren't there bigger things you can crab about?
l love your pizza!
i keep buying your pizzas, and have yet to eat one, my dear family eats them as soon as i get them home! i hear their wonderful.
Honestly?? I can't believe all of the rude, negative posts. Get a grip people. Its a coupon. Before jumping all over the company, why don't you take a breath and give them the benefit of the doubt and find out what happened. Sheesh! CPK - love your restaurants, love your food. My only wish would be to have Chicken Thai back in the grocery section. <3
We got CPK take-out tonight. We LOVE CPK! EXCEPT... the bread... is so lame. HOWEVER... last time we got take-out, a few weeks ago, instead of the usual lame (french, I think) bread in our bag was some SUPER DELICIOUS, CHEWY, pizza-crust-ish, SOFT, TASTY bread strips!! In fact, tonight we were SO EXCITED to get those again with our order... but then, fail, we got the old lame bread. What was that bread last time??? Pleeeease can we have it again!?!?!?!? (CPK Rolling Hills, CA)
I love these pizzas I clicked on the like button but there are no more prints this sucks.
Just wanted to let everyone at CPK that I have never tried your product until I printed off the $1.25 coupon...I bought a few of them from Target and WOW I'm hooked!!! Great job on your pizzas, they are delish! Even my husband (a very picky eater) said they are "frickin great". Needless to say you have gained another loyal customer!!!!
ummm hello california pizza kitchen! you said to check back today for coupons....I dont see any.....did you geek us again????
Where can you buy the pizzas - which grocery stores???
think these pizzas are some of the best we have ever had from frozen
Thank You California Pizza for the great high-value coupon! I was finally able to print it a few minutes ago. Now I will wait for a good sale on your products since it has a 30 days from not expiration.
So, I have to be honest. I am having your pizza for the first time, and I am uber dissapointed. 
MY DAUGHTER WHO DOESNT EAT VEGETABLES LOVES THE WHITE PIZZA WITH SPINACH. THANKS FOR THE COUPON:}
What happend to the Shrimp Scampi pizza? I loved that pizza.
Can't wait to meet my GF for lunch today Thia chicken Pizza here I come!!

Not proud of you for your decision to support Lady Gaga and her Born this Way "Campaign". You just lost some business.
Target, congratulations on a great move in the right direction. My partner and I haven't stepped foot in one of your stores since the very first day of the boycott - translating to lost revenue of at least $2500 (probably more). And that's just for one couple. May you stick to what you know is right and avoid more fumbles. We've all missed you and I think many of us are excited to return to your stores - but do remember - we're paying attention to everything you do, both the good and the bad!
Thank you for changing your stance on LBGT rights- now that you will be changing the charities you support with your dollars, I will be bringing my dollars back to Target. 
Why are the engineers always breaking the law with regards to whistle blowing ? Federal law mandates 4 pulls at a crossing. I live 2 blocks northeast of a crossing and many many times have counted 8 pulls or more per train in the middle of the night.
In recognition of Black History Month, Norfolk Southern would like to thank all of its African-American employees for the role they play in making us the safest, most customer-focused and successful transportation company in the world.
Southern RR 630 in Chattanooga is getting her paint job today for the first time in 22 years!!! She should be steaming soon and on the mainline on NS tracks!! Welcome back 630!!
You guys ever thought of bringing on N&W 611 and 1218 for you steam roster. 611 shouldn't need too much to get her going or even Frisco 1522, she operated not too long ago and she only needs minor repairs. If you're bringing on three beautiful steamers why not a few more? Make it an even crowd? :D Thanks for bringing these old girls back to life, 610, 630 and 4501 will NOT fail to disappoint! :)
To all of our Hampton Roads fans, have you seen our new billboard? Where did you see it?

Norfolk Southern's Exhibit Car illustrates how people and technology support the company's vision to be the safest, most customer-focused and successful transportation company in the world. A restored passenger coach, the Exhibit Car has been in operation on Norfolk Southern since 1971. More than 1.5 million people have been aboard in 300 communities. 
Governor Bob McDonnell announced that Norfolk Southern Railway Company is acquiring 1,500 new railcars from Chicago-based FreightCar America, Inc.

Got the "hired" phone call today and report to GA on Feb 14th for training.....woo hoo!! Glad to be on the NS Team!!
I just received my 2011 NS Calendar in the mail. Yes I procrastinated calling in my order, but the photographs are awesome as usual. Congrats to Casey Thomason on his new position as Corporate Photographer for Norfolk Southern! I have enjoyed his calendar shots for years.
I wish you guys would bring back the 4-8-4 J streamlined steam engine and also buy the American Orient Express train too combined the two and you get a time warp
I am curious how you can allow steam on your rails again when it's friction bearing and I heard that Norfolk Southern does not like friction bearing equipment on their tracks. A tourist railroad in Jim Thorpe, PA runs side by side with your tracks and I asked a question about their steam train running an excursion on NS (they used to run mainline trips on Conrail from the Reading area between 1985-1988) and their reply was that NS won't allow friction bearings and almost all their coaches are friction bearing (the older, steel heavyweight coaches from the 1920's with windows that open). They do run longer excursions on their own tracks and they have enough track to run longer trips so they don't need NS. Will there be any open window coaches used on the NS steam excursions? Would NS allow it?
January was reading month in the Chesapeake Public Schools and the theme was "All Aboard the Literacy Express". Some of the teachers from Thurgood Marshall Elementary (in Chesapeake, VA) displayed their Norfolk Southern spirit while reading to their students. Hope everyone had a fun and educational time!
I have an idea for the new Norfolk Southern 21st Century Steam Program, a steam trip through eastern PA! Look at this http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=131767 and this http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=131768 one of YOUR observations at the end of the train! This was a fantrip in 1988 on Conrail trackage in eastern PA that you now own. NKP #765 was used. I'm wondering if #765 will be used as part of the program or if you will let the Fort Wayne guys run excursions on NS?
Had an awesome time today on Roanoke Terminal; going down Memory Lane with some co-workers. Things have certainly changed in transportation. Hope new employees take experience from older employees, to make tomorrow a better industry for every one. 
Thanks in large part to Norfolk Southern, the Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society will be operating trips behind steam locomotive no. 765 in Indiana in May, June, and July! http://bit.ly/fQsuct

So happy you guys delivered to Beech Springs today! THANK YOU!!! I needed that strawberry congealed salad and lasagna today! ;)
Read about the Pres. Day sale. Saw item I wanted. Showed up 15 mins early. Was 2nd in line. Made bee-line to item. Got tag (there were at least 10 there). Went to counter. Was told "I just sold my last one." What???? So let's see: you advertise items for sale but don't actually STOCK them? Rethink marketing - you suceeded in making a loyal customer - RAVING FAN - into an angry one. Good job.
I was to Staples last weekend and got a very nice young lady who helped me find ALL the dollar and two-dollar items I wanted that were on special. She then got someone else to take my online order for a shredder that was on sale. I was astounded with all the special help I received. THANK YOU!!!
Sundays big game isnt just about football. Its a day to indulge in the not-so-good for you snacks. Tell us your favorite gameday food. Mmmmm. Pigs in a blanket.
THANK YOU STAPLES! I just bought a Canon all-in-one fax printer etc...from Staples.com. Retail $199, minus rebates, coupons, staples rewards etc...and it cost.....drumroll.......62 cents! Including FREE SHIPPING!!!! Im totally excited!!!! I just had to tell someone! :)
Cupid stopped by last week and picked up thousands of rubber bands, rulers and thumbtacks. Something tells us hes making his own bow and arrows this year. Were hoping he gets you! Happy Valentines Day!

TJ MAXX, I LIVE at your stores, any chance we could host birthday parties there??? What i'm talking is a few women, standing around with cupcakes holding some sparkling ...something. Then, you tell their friends "EVERYONE GETS TO SEE HOW THEY CAN GET THE MAXX for their (whatever number) $10 each.. whoever gets the most for their money, and makes the birthday girl the happiest wins!!! Gotta have, like a stopwatch... who can find the best bargain in the store the quickest for the money... TJMAXX parties and games !! YAY!!! Who is with me???
I have to say I stopped into my local TJ Maxx store today (Marlton, NJ) and was so thrilled to find so many items on clearance. Of note, I spent about $37 on baby clothes (I'm expecting in April) and saved $36 off of TJ's regular price (not to mention the full "Compare At" prices). I love a good sale...and I love TJ's!
I have an issue. Why are all of your post geared towards womens fashion and accessories? We men enjoy finding a great bargain at The Maxx as well. I love buying my name brand designer underwear at your store because I know I am getting a great deal, as well as Docker pants, great dress shirts, and casual wear. So how about a little more attention to us guys too ok?
I would love if you could start carrying children's shoes like Ross does. I have only seen girls flip flops and house shoes. Would love to see girls shoes in name brands like you carry for women.

I contacted a company of a belt I purchased recently at TJMaxx - just to ask if they could tell the exact retail value. According to the part number stamped on the back, it was from their 2002 collection. All of their belts sell for in the $200 range that I have seen so far. It would be interesting to know how I have found a few items over the past few months that are from several years ago - another item - a Jacket - was from 2006 according to the booklet attached to it. I wonder if this store just keeps finding things in their storeroom or if there are cases with some items that they just get "found" and purchased for resale at a much later date than "previous season". Many items I find are from this season so to speak. It would be interesting to know how this works.

Love TJ Maxx...BUT what is UP with the CIA type questioning when you return something? Doesn't the business, TJ Maxx want customers that are happy with the products they buy? All the questioning, phone calls.... "we'll do it THIS TIME". Gimme a break. I took heat today b/c I took the tags off a sports bra (BROUGHT them with me, mind you). I know this rant will result in nothing changing, but it felt good, so...thanks : )

What's on the plate for Friday at Omaha Hy-Vee # 5, 7910 Cass !!! Johnny's Grilled Trout with dill sauce !!! YUMMY !!!! Stop by for a Sample !!!
With the exceptional weather forecast these past few days, has anyone started grilling yet?
Let me first say that I love HyVee but was wondering why the Norfolk NE location will not take internet buy one get one free coupons also today I bought 3 Cheerios, 4 BC fruitsnacks, 1 bc cookie mix and 2 toaster stroutal and did not get the 50 bonus boxtop slip at checkout..mentioned it to the checker and he said "he didn't know why it didn't print" and that was it...kind of disappointed with experience today.
can't help but laugh at the ad for gerber baby food being 4/$3 - that makes it cost more than the normal price. Luckily Sioux Falls stores were on the ball and caught this!
We know these may not look very pretty, but they are very tasty! Rich in vitamins B and C, the Ugli Fruit promotes healthy gums and overall oral health. Look for in-store samples this Friday 4pm-7pm and Saturday 10am 2pm. Have you tried Ugli Fruit?
Why is it different Hy-Vee's in the same city have a variety of costs for the same item? I was purchasing something at one Hy-Vee and just happened to stop at another where it was less expensive! Isn't the pricing the same with all stores?!!
Operation BBQ For Our Troops - Midwest Division Operation BBQ for Our Troops (OBFOT) is a non partisan group of BBQ Competition Teams, Backyard BBQers, and BBQ enthusiasts that come together to show our appreciation by providing our military members a picnic that centers around the uniquely American foo...d of BBQ. Across the country our service men and women along with their families have come together before or after deployment for a FREE BBQ meal. Military families have participated in Appreciation Day picnics while their loved ones are on active duty in far off locations. Others have received Turkeys or hams during the holidays. All of these things are FREE to them, which is our way of saying thank you. OBFOT is also appreciative of those that have served our country and are no longer on active duty or in reserve units. They are afforded the same FREE meals through appreciation days and Senior Qs at local VFWs or retirement communities. 
This week's meal planner is spicy sesame peanut noodles. http://hy-vee.gsnrecipes.com/Recipes/RecipeFull.aspx?RecipeID=61586
Disliked the ad that had Hy Vee brand Omeprazole 42 ct for $16.99 when ended up paying $27 for only 28. How does that work?!
On behalf of the UMKC SIFE team thank you for your sponsorship.
Dear, Hy-Vee: I need for the 2.5 lbs. of frozen chicken breast to go on sale for about $5 or less. Thanks.
I love your Minnesota Ave store in Sioux Falls. It is the best HyVee by far. The one downfall is that you don't carry bigger than 8oz. cans of Hershey's Cocoa for baking. That's only enough for one or 2 cakes. The Sunshine stores that you took over carried the bigger cans, but now I can't find them. Please look into stocking the bigger sizes. Could you get the 16 oz. or even 23 oz canisters? Please?
Grapes are a healthy alternative to sugary, high calorie snacks that also contain compounds that reduce the risk of heart disease. How do you like to eat grapes; frozen, chilled, or at room temperature?
We need a Hyvee around NW 48th St Lincoln NE 68528. There area is growing like crazy and we just have an IGA thathas horrible produce, expensive prices, and really bad customer service. Please and thank you!
who is the girl singing in the commercials? i love her voice!
Did you know Honeydew is known as a fitness fruit? It contains vitamin C which helps reduce muscle pain following intense exercise.
I lived in NC for a few years and I remember one time I was shopping at Lowe's for new appliances. I opened the fridge to find the empty display boxes in there, to show how food fits, were Hy-Vee brand products! It made me miss home :)
I would love for Hy-Vee to start carrying Weight Watchers bread. I am looking for the Weight Watchers Pita Pocket Bread. I shop at the NE Englwwod Rd and N St Claire Ave locations in Kansas City, MO. No grocery stores in our area carries the Weight Watchers bread. Thank you....

Hy-Vee on Lincoln Way in Ames is the absolute best!!! I called the Bakery today around Noon and told the cake decorators that I know they're very busy on a Friday, but that my husband just shot a "300" bowling last night. I asked if there was anyway possible the lady could decorate a chocolate cake with bowling pins, a bowling ball, the number "300" and Congrats John. I thought she was going to laugh as she paused and said "I can have that ready for you in an hour!!!!" Look at this Amazing Cake!!! This Hy-Vee at 640 Lincoln in Ames has the BEST cake decorators. WOW!!!! Thank you so much!!!!!!

So I just stopped at Hy-vee to pick up my 2 8x10 prints that I ordered yesterday and was very disappointed when I got home and looked at them! I ordered 2 8x10's in matte and they came in 8x12 glossy with the picture completely cropped! If I even wanted to put in in a frame I would have to cut off my picture!

I've always had only one crock pot (slow cooker) in the house. My pots grew larger, well, as my family grew larger. Since my family size is now back to two, my large cooker is a bit too big for just the two of us. So, I purchased a smaller crock, 3qt., (http://www.crock-pot.com/Product.aspx?cid=113&pid=1546) and am loving it. I'm now delighted to be the proud owner of more than one tough!!!!

Chicken With Lai Haak and Bamboo Shoot(khorisa)
Bhapot Diya Elsih (Steamed Hilsa)
Steamed Lai haak. I Just love this way of Cooking the Haak
Puthi masor aanja allu di... Ingredients Puti (Spot-fin swamp barb) : 150 gms Potato (medium size) : 1 pc Garlic :2-3 cloves Cumin powder : 1 teaspoon Coriander powder : 2 teaspoon Red chili powder : 2 teaspoon Salt & turmeric powder : As per requirement Mustard oil : 100 gms Red chilies (dry) : 2 pcs Method Cut the fishes, wash and marinate with salt and turmeric powder. Peel the potato and make 2 pieces of it horizontally. Make fine pieces of it again horizontally. Cut it into pieces along the length. Chop onion .Slit the green chilies. Put a kadahi on the oven and pour half of the mustard oil in it. Now get the fish fried well. Don't add all fish at once into the oil. Fry small amount of fish at a time. Add oil if needed. No need to deep fry. Add rest of the oil in the pan. As the oil is hot add garlic cloves, red chilies (dry), black cumin seeds and onion there after. Fry the onion a little and add the potato. Stir. As the potato is fried add salt, turmeric powder, cumin powder, red chili powder, coriander powder. Cook for a while. Sprinkle some water and keep stirring. Cover it at times. Potato will get cooked in this way. As it starts to make crackling sound, remove cover and the fried fish. Keep stirring. As the entire curry becomes dry, brings it down from the oven. Make sure the curry is not too dry. Keep it in another container and cover. Serve hot with plain rice .
BETGAJ (Rattan shoot) Cut tender shoot of betgaj into small small pieces.Soak the same in salted water for sometime and drain.Fry onion+green chili in m/oil and add betgaj.Add haldi and adjust salt.Fry in low flame till it becomes soft n tender.Betgaj gives a bit bitter taste.....but its nice and healthy.

Digital Ambush contest update
Does anybody know what the read/write speed of the WD Caviar black sata 3 drives are? I own a 1Tb one and would like to know how it compares to my OCZ Vertex 2!
Western Digital WD TV Live Hub Review http://bit.ly/dFoSJW Hot Hardware says "The WD TV Live Hub isn't just the best media player in Western Digital's lineup, it's arguably the set-top box to beat out of the entire field."
i will never buy or support your product......you are a horrible company for what you did. 
Nice way to weasel out of giving away a prize package. Kind of a ham-fisted excuse for not awarding it to the rightful winner, too. Makes me wonder what the REAL reason is on your end. Hmmm... Oh, well. You've just taken a page out of the Dan Snyder Handbook and attracted more negative publicity to your company than you have positive. Good job! I'll be sure to avoid anything made by Western Digital the next time I look to purchase electronics and will discourage others to avoid WD like the plague, too. Good job!
There seems to be some confusion regarding the controversy about WD taking away Matt's prize package. I had disabled the Ambush App access to my page after this little brouhaha went down. From what you had told Matt, only people who have ENTERED the contest have access to the Ambush App and see it pop up on their FB page under their Privacy Settings/Apps & Websites. However, I did NOT enter the contest or create an Ambush of my own, yet the Ambush App was still able to have access to my page under my Settings/Apps & Websites. I only voted for and supported Matt's Ambush and did not enter the contest. There seems to be a huge discrepancy in what you told Matt about why he was disqualified since this app has access to profiles of those who voted AND who entered as opposed to JUST those who entered.

I have several external wd hard drives and i love them. However, I'm really disappointed with your backup solution which was a major purchase reason initially. I have a really fast computer but this crappy piece of software manages to slow it down to a point where i can't move the mouse anymore and it's not the setup, i tried it on different systems. The worst thing is that this even happens when no usb hard drive is connected! You should really stop advertising the my book essential series with its backup capability as long as its not working!

We love the Tofu Teriyaki Wrap. I just wished they sold them everywhere they sell your burritos. We have to make special trips and stock up.
My boyfriend and I love your cheese free veggie pizza. He is allergic to milk and eggs so he usually isn't able to have frozen pizza. So glad you guys make this. ^_^
I just toasted a piece of asiago bread and crumbled it into Amy's organic chunky tomato soup...it doesn't get much better than this. Yummo!
I finally got around to trying one of your products, and began my love affair with your company with Palak Paneer. I can't wait to try ANYTHING else in your line. LOVED IT!!
Hi Amy's can you start to make your soup cans with a convience top that does not need a can opener? I thought it did and brought my soup to work and could not get it opened :-(
Dear Amy's: Have you considered making a family size version of your delicious pizzas? 
I just ate your spinach and feta pocket sandwich. It was yummy and made me want to find your FB page. YUM! Thanks for making yummy & healthy microwave food that I can eat at work or when I don't feel like cooking at home. You make my life easier. :)
Thank you Amy's for the gift pack. The lentil vegetable soup is amazing. A pull top on the cans would be a great addition :-) 
Just had Amy's Chili for lunch today. Snowed in and was glad to have something good on hand to eat! Mmmmm...Amy's Chili!
love the Tamale Verde, tried it for the first time, will be buying more!!!
Just came up with a super easy delish recipe using Amy's soups and beans! Started with the vegetable barley soup, added some leftover black beans, some black eyed peas, handful of fresh spinach, dash of salt, red pepper flakes, and coriander, and added a bit of shredded parmesan at the end. Poured over brown rice; so hearty and so healthy! I love you Amy's! Thanks for making being a vegetarian so easy!
Just had Amy's veggie lasagna for dinner, I LOVE her food :)
My husband and I are just recovering from the blizzard and today my package arrived...talk about perfect timing! About to warm up with your delicious soup, thank you so much!!
Are you able to post when your soups go on sale at Whole Foods or is that their promotion? I love to stock up when they are discounted. 
The Teriyaki Bowl with tofu is amazing! I don't usually eat or enjoy rice, but this just made it taste amazing! Thanks!
Have tried both the dairy free gluten free veggie pizza and the DFGF Mac and Cheeze and they are both wonderful! I'm so glad you are there to cater to my little one and I
We love Amy's Margherita Pizza!!
Just discovered your products via the amazing burritos! I am inspired to healthier eating and trying all of Amy's products!
Lights out Pizza!
Love, love, love your soups (my comfort food!). So glad to see your products lining the shelves of mainstream grocery stores now (in their health food section). Can't wait to try the pizza! :-D
ATTENTION: I have just tasted the BEST canned soup in my life EVER!!!! Low Sodium Lentil and Vegetable....to die for! Just sayin'....
LONG time fan of your products. The cheese enchiladas are my fave as is the thai coconut soup! And the veg chili too. Really, i could go on and on!
Amy's Margherita Pizza for dinner. Sure glad I only bought the little one, not enough self control to have saved some for lunch tomorrow. Dang that's some good pizza.
I love love love the Mushroom/Olive pizza! I have at least once a week now. Delicous! :) 
Just enjoyed the Cheese Enchilada Whole Meal. Wondering what components make a "whole meal"? Full serving of veggies? Serving of grain, dairy, etc?
Amys tortillini with pesto&the broccoli&cheese pockets <3 <3
I absolutely love pretty much every Amy's brand meal I've tried. No worries about any of the plethora of things out there to avoid. I would REALLY like to see the interior of the boxed frozen meals packaged in something other than plastic in the near future though! Have you considered paper?
You have the best pesto tortellini I have ever tasted and your cheddar bowl is my favorite comfort food. I've tried many of your products and I've never had a bad bite. Plus, you have, in my personal opinion, the best brand name ever! :)
I'm In Love With Amy's Soups<3! I'm A Vegan And I Just LOVE LOVE Themm Hahah The Lentil Soups Is My Favorite(:
For dinner I had one of your cheddar veggie burgers with a tsp of mustard and ketchup, and a slice of avocado, and then put into a wheat pita! Yummy! :D My mother had it with some lettuce and mayo and a pita, and loved hers too!
Just a heads up to anyone in BC Canada...Save on Foods has the buritos, pot pies and mac and cheese on for 2 for $5!!!! Cheapest ive ever seen them in Canada!! 
Just tried your Tamale Verde--a very nice lunch.
Just had the little Mexican Tamale pie for lunch and it was fantastic!!! Yum!!!
I just had the non-dairy, cholesterol free, gluten free Black bean and veggie enchiladas. I am absolutely SHOCKED at the delicious flavor and thick consistency of the red sauce. It's better than many restaurants red sauce! I am a fan from this day on and look forward to many more meals courtesy of Amy's. YAY! So glad to have found these foods :) 
I absolutely love Amy's Cheese and Vege Tamale Verde. I haven't had tamales this good in over 25 years. I used to date a man from Puerto Rico and his mom would always send me her homemade tamales which were divine. I was spoiled for life. Until Amy's Tamales came to market. She has several types of tamales and they are all good but the cheese and vege with verde sauce is my favorite. They all come with a side of seasoned brown rice and black beans, also very delicious. 
I just had the tofu pocket with shitake mushrooms scramble for the 1st time and love it!! I have been cravings eggs for some time now and do not know how to make my tofu taste like that...yummy!! Does anyone have a recipe for me so that I can get tofu to taste like eggs??? 
I LOVE your Organic Lentil Soup -- the best lentil soup I've ever had! And your Spinach Feta in a Pocket Sandwich is my favorite snack!
Just sitting on FB while eating a bowl of Amy's Spicy Chili which I added some grated cheese and onions to....delicious!
Just had the Organic Cheese Enchilada - SCRUMPTIOUS!!! and fits in my weight watcher's plan!
i miss that spinach pizza especially when they gave it free to the employees
A few days ago I was lamenting to my friend how I wished that there would be a gluten-free version of the Roasted Vegetable Pizza. When I saw it today at Whole Foods in Andover, MA I felt like I have got the Powerball jackpot! I cannot thank you enough for the joy and delight this new pizza brought to me and my kids! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
I love you whole meal enchilada, just wish I could find one with cheese in it but still you're food is the greatest. I'll even let my kiddos eat you pizza snacks opposed to the other brand. :) Thank you Amy's for delicious wholesome food that I can trust (kisses)
Wow! Amy's Enchilada Verde Spinach & Cheese Enchilada. Yum yum. 
Have you, by chance, recently changed the type of onion used in your soups and other frozen entrees?
Mattar Paneer - YUM YUM
Mmmm! Tks for making our gluten free diet less difficult! My favorite is Amy's GF Frozen Mac & Cheese, but I can't find it here, in Canada. I buy bulk when I go to the US. 
I have just tried the Veggie Loaf meal, and all I can say is WOW!!!!!
Love the Tofu Scramble!!! :) Thank you!!!
LOVE the Veggie Lasagna!
Just had the organic vegetable pie for the first time and it was SOOOOOO GOOOOD!!!! I will definitely be stocking up on those little guys!!!! Thanks for making eating healthy so delicious!! :-D
I love You amy's! Just finished my favorite Black bean Enchilada! Thanks!!
I love the new gluten-free burritos! I hope all burrito flavors will be available gluten-free soon. Especially the Indian wraps!
Will your Non Dairy Rice Mac & Cheeze be vegan? Is it out? I cannot find it anywhere.
So I saw you guys discontinued the Kids Meal Quesadilla. :( I was wondering why? Me and my younger siblings loved it. The only reason we didn't buy it as much was because whole foods was the only place that carried it.
my amy's fat free chunky vegetable soup was the perfect lunch today as it is -6 degrees out! mmm warmed me right up!
I looooooooooove your vegan products!!! Quick request... could you consider in the future making the Mexican tofu scramble with vegan cheese? It's my fave, but since going vegan I (Try!) don't eat it. :( I love the vegan cheese on your ziti kids meal!!
Dear Amy's - I FINALLY got my hands on your Light & Lean meals. LOOOOOVE IT!!!! And most are only 6 weight watchers points (and so filling!)!! THANK YOU!.
i tried Vegetable Lasagna and it was great even my 2 yr old enjoyed it . i wish Spinach lasagna (light n lean) was Kosher too . 
I had the Roasted Vegetable pizza last night - delish! 
Love, love, love your cuisine! Be my Valentine?
We're having this for dessert today! Check out our recipes page for more dessert ideas! http://www.amys.com/lemonslice/lunchbox/recipes_desserts.php
Amy's curried lentil soup over leftover diced baked potato with a couple of spoonfuls of plain yogurt. Sooooo good. Glad I saved half the can of soup - I can repeat tomorrow!
trying one of your lower sodium pizzas and it's great! my blood pressure thanks you!
OMG! Your chunky tomato soup is soooooooo good!!!
Eating Pesto Tortellini! Yum!
Amy's gluten free, dairy free, and soy free macaroini and cheeze is absolutely delish!! Ive tried other vegan macsncheeses and they were awful! Thank you! 
Just ate Tofu Scramble with Veggies and Hashbrowns....Wonderfully YUMMY!!!
Vegetable and Lentil Soup...AWESOME!!! 
love your lentil soup! :)
So glad my son could enjoy having mac and cheese for the first time thanks to your dairy free mac and cheese!!!! <3
Love these pizzas..........yummy!
Just tried Amy's cheese enchillada...it was just as good or better than I used to get at the Pilot House in Pocatello in college. I highly recommend it and can't wait to try other products!
I know I asked about the discontinuing of the Mexican Quesadilla earlier. But I have a different question. Are there any still in stores? The reason I ask this is because when I bought the Kids Mac N Cheese it said it was still available.
I love your products and was wondering if you offered any coupons, I love your quarter pounder veggie burgers ! Thanks :)
cheese-less pizza is my fav
Wow. I have to say, I am by no means a fan of frozen pizza. But when I saw how good yours looked, I had to try some. It came out of the oven looking and smelling amazing. First taste was exquisite. I am definitely hooked! Way better than any other frozen pizza out there, that's for sure!
I don't like Amy's , I Love <3 Amy's. I lost 2 sizes in 5 weeks thanks to Amy's. My goal is 2 more sizes. I am not really a Veggie, but this food is totally organic. And the proof is my weight loss.
Your Orange Cake is the most moist heavenly thing I ever put in my mouth and sinless. thank you!
I tried the Country Cheddar Bowl for lunch today. WHOA! Yummy & filling. Is there a recipe you can direct me to, to make baked tofu similar to what was in the Cheddar bowl?
Without your soy cheese pizza, my twin girls wouldn't know much about pizza at all!
Amy's Chunky Tomato Bisque is DIVINE! I wish I could afford to eat Amy's products for every meal!
my son can eat a strawberry toaster pop every morning! he also loves your mac n cheese. i love everything i have tased!!!!!! i wish our grocery stores would dedicate to a larger variety. i was just browsing online and had no idea of all these wonderful looking products.
An Earth Fare store opened today and I saw so many choices of Low Sodium soups I was overwhelmed! I picked up the Butternut Squash and the Minestrone. So happy!!!
had my very first Amy's kitchen product tonight and LOVED IT!!!!! big 2 thumbs up for the teriyaki bowl!!!!!!!
Amy's entrees in stores are getting more and more popular here in the Kerrville Texas area! Makes me wish I could have a small store with all Amy's products!! Soups, Chili, Entrees, Pizzas -- just all of it!
just had the vegan chunky vegetable soup - delicious!
Love the cheese enchiladas (enjoying them now) and bean burritos!!!! 
Pizza is delicious, in fact, everthing is!
I am excited about Amy's new veggie burger made with quinoa and walnuts
Just tried your individual sized "cheeze" pizza - surprisingly delicious! Bravo!
Your spinach pizza is YUMMY! 
I'm eating the light and lean pasta with asparagus and broccoli for lunch...Yummy!
Just stocked up on loads of Amy's meals! My local Hannaford did a redesign, and now offers tons more of your products. SO HAPPY :)
enjoying a nice warm bowl of Amy's Macaroni & Cheese and as much as I hate to admit it, it's almost better than my homemade mac & cheese (almost). <3 it! 
Just had Amy's Organic Chocolate Cake......Sooo Good!
The tofu scramble is absolutely delicious!! :)
I just had the light & lean Pasta and Veggies!!! So YUMMY. The asparagus was so fresh! 
The Best Mac &amp; Cheese! It is outrageous... I wish it came in family size...
Love Amy's! Just had the veggie burger..its so good you can eat it plain!! 
We just tried your Tomato Bisque and Fire Roasted Vegetable and were very impressed! We're trying to eat as much organic as possible, but I'm not in a major metro area. Do you know if a good variety of your products are sold at Meijer stores? We've tried your beans and soups, loved them, and are excited to try some of your frozen products too. 
having a bowl of Mexican Casserole, & loving the little pieces of tamales... yum!
You have been my dinner and snack for two days- so satisfying and yummy! Had the light spinach lasagna last night and the light in sodium spinach pizza tonight, chocolate cake for a snack. Yum,yum, yummy. : ) and my tummy feels good,too.
I tried your Gluten-free Chocolate Cake tonight and it was delicious I actually think I like it more than the Original one. :) I also got my hands on the Vegan/GF/SF Mac & Cheese. I can't wait to try it!
OK... we got a problem! I ate an Amy's gluten free rice crust spinach pizza last night. I've had them many times. This pizza was NOT gluten free. And I have been up suffering ALL night. You need to get on the quality control thing! This wasn't just a little contamination. This was a full blown dose of gluten. I'm miserable!
If it weren't for your gluten free mac and cheese, i don't think i'd ever eat!! It is soooooo good!!
Hi -- what is the status of the release of your BPA-free soup cans? Will the new BPA-free cans be labeled as such? I am very excited about this positive change. Thank you!
Just tried the Indian Palak Paneer for the first time. Delicious!!!
Eating Vegetable Lasagna tonite..mmmm. Love the pizza products! Love the way there's no greasy oil dripping down my hands like regular pizza..Delicious!
I'm addicted.......to your low fat Black Bean Vegetable Soup! I can not get enough of it.....it is so satisfying....unfortunately my husband is not too keen of the breath it leaves me.... :( But it is so worth it!
Just tried the Organic Vegetable Lasagna ...wow it was delicious! Just gained a customer; I can't wait to try the other meals. :)
I'm new to the gluten free thing and just tried the mac and cheese. So delicious! The spinach pizza is great too!
Amy's Teriyaki bowl was my first tofu EVER...I was expecting it to be scary, but it was AMAZING. You got a new customer!!!! Thanks for making dinner!!!!
I LOVE the gluten free Mac and Cheese! It's wonderful! Also tried the G-free burritos-wonderful! What other entrees are available g-free and soy free?
Just had the Brown Ricce & Vegetable Bowl, my first Amy's product ever. I am a convert. Off to buy as many Amy's products as I can find.
Our family is so into the Pot-pies its ridiculous! Great flavor, great flavor, greeeat flavor!
Having some Amys Mac & Cheese for lunch.... my favorite
My husband loves the tofu scrambles and I keep our freezer stocked! I wish you guys had occasional coupons to help our wallets!
my son LOVES your gluten free and dairy free mac and cheese! he is so happy that we found a mac and cheese he can enjoy!! THANK YOU!
AMY'S! My school catering totally sucks. Thankfully, there's grocery stores nearby plus we have a little grocery store on campus...all of which carry your products! You save my life on a daily basis!!!! Your pizzas turned my boyfriend organic! I LOVE YOU GUYS!
just had some delicious thai canned soup. it's my fav; made my day!
do you sell anything Amy's in bulk at Sam's, BJ's or Costco? I'd be looking in the Raleigh NC area. 
I just heard Wal-Mart will no longer sell organic food. Does that include Amy's Kitchen items?
We recently started trying Amy's products in an effort to eat healthier more natural foods in our household. I hate veggies, with a passion. But, I have found all the meals I have tried to be very tasty and yummy. I actually eat all the veggies and enjoy the meals. Thank you for making a healthy, organic, veggie rich product that everyone can love!
Love the Light & Lean Spinach Lasagna. Just had some for dinner!!
It borderlines on obsessive, how much I love Amy's cheese enchiladas. When the kids (I have 5) request macaroni and cheese AGAIN, I turn to these enchiladas for a quick, DELICIOUS, nutritious lunch. Thanks!
Love the new light and Lean Pasta and Veggie bowl!
I always suggest Amy burritos + a small green salad to my clients for a quick, portable, healthy (and simply delicious) lunch.
The cheddar bowl is my addiction!!
Love Amy's foods--just finished a low sodium veggie lasagna which is my favorite.
I just ate the rice macaroni with dairy free Daiya cheese. I loved it! Thank you for making a wonderful vegan version of mac and cheese! I have not eaten mac and cheese since I became vegan years ago. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
I think I found my new drug...Amy's Organic Golden Lentil Soup. But I needed to add some Celtic Sea Salt just to tie it all together.
If your rice mac n' cheeze isn't God's gift to vegans, I'm not sure what is!! 
vegetarian college student here, I just just discovered your canned soups. They are AMAZING! You should thank Allthatglitters21 on youtube for introducing it to me. 
Amy's stuffed shells bowl really do taste homemade...from the pasta, to the sauce, then to the light ricotta-spinach filling.
...also, ever since I started eating pre-made foods that are leaner, more natural, more organic, most brands have had to totally revamp their recipes just to appeal to the public. I know some great frozen meals now that were really nasty (sometimes to the point of giving me indigestion) "back in the day". Amy's quality and taste has ALWAYS been the standard by which I choose the premade foods I eat.

Just bought the healthy bones . All nine love them including the picky dog. We had to go buy 3 more bags. Can you make them in a bigger bag size for multi dog households.
How long have you been using the pea protein in the L.I.D. sweet potato and venison? Just want to know since we have a dog with a very sensitive tummy.
Noticed a difference in the seet potato and vension dog food 15 pound bags. Bags dated sell by Jan 2012 had food that is flatter, a tan color instead of brown and our dog seems to be extremely hungry. We returned a bag and unfortunately got one with the same sell by date: same problems. Just purchased an "older" bag with a sell by date of 11/22/2011 and the food seems to be the be quality we are used too. What is going on? Our dog has severe allergies and can not tolerate changes in his food. Help!!
Is Sweet Potato and Venison the most popular dog food choice you offer? And is that why I can never find it at Petco with $5.00 off like most of the other Natural Balance flavors usually are? Just wondering. I have 5 Big Dogs and go thru plenty of that flavor a month. Just wished it came in bigger bags! I do get the free bag after every ten at Petco,but it doesn't take me long to hit the 10 Mark. Keep up the Good work All my Doggies love it!! Lastly, do you recommend switching flavors occasionally or should I stick with Sweet Potato/Venison. I have tried a couple of the others and they don't seem to like it as mich!! Thanks for your time...
Jebs Pet Supply in Cle Elum, WA we sell lots of your food and just notice there is a way for our customers to get coupons. I will let my customers know. And we do have the frequent buyers cards. But I am out of the cards for the customers. Thank you

MARY BAKER (HEART BLANKET BACKDROP) 2.5YR BORN ON VALENTINES, THOUGHT I'D SHARE.
This is Ch. Dynadaux I Love This Bar aka Toby. He has just returned from competing at NYC's Westminster Kennel Club show where we were able to talk to your sales reps at the Hotel Penn. Toby suffered from frequent Kidney Stones on his previous food. But has eaten nothing but Natural Balance for the last nearly 3 years and has never had a reoccurance of the problem. Just wanted to thank you for such a wonderful product. His favorite so far is the Duck and Potato and the Lamb.. he prefers the roll foods. Also just got his new Duck and Potato treats...
Team 4 Dawg Flite is off this weekend to a DockDogs event in Biloxi, MS. Keep your fingers crossed that they jump B-I-G! They will be sporting their Natural Balance competition vests. We always get tons of questions from people about how we keep our dogs so healthy and their coats looking so shiny and nice. We always say it's the Natural Balance food we feed them. Our events always give us great opportunities to talk about not only the importance of feeding such a good food, but about good dog care in general.
Team 4 Dawg Flite is off to Charleston, SC this weekend for a big national event. We go every year and always have so much fun! This is a photo of Sally at Charleston last year. Probably won't have any photos from this year because hubby (pro photographer) can't go. But keep your fingers and paws crossed that we jump BIG!
Happy Valentine's Day!
Tillman - The Skateboarding Dog had a blast with WPLG's Local 10 Morning News last Friday!
I really like the Vegetarian Dry dog food. It has helped my English Bulldog cut down on her scratching from meat based dog foods. Thank you
just wondering if anyones cats have been sick who are being fed the "reduced Calorie" formula?
Hey everyone, I hope someone could answer this for me. My dog and cat both LOVE their natural balance diets. I even get my dog those yummy dog food rolls, they are great!! But my cat snatched a piece up the other night and she really seemed to like it! I'm pretty sure there's no harm done as this isn't your grocery store brand or anything bad.. they don't even use dyes. But would it be okay to feed these to the cat (in much smaller portions) on occasion now and then? I know that cat's and dog's nutritional needs vary and I'm not about to switch from cat to dog food here. Just thought this treat might be alright. And if not Natural Balance ought to think of making some for cats!! Because she was begging for more but I didn't want to just yet without seeing what people thought. Thanks in advance for any advice!!!

Hi, we are in Australia, and we use your brand(first time), after hearing/reading about it in Rubys Tail by Pat Bettendorf. Our dog seems to love it. a recommendation "Resealable bags".. here in Australia they are becomming more common/popular...especially when you have cockroaches, ants etc getting in...I had to buy a big food bin to store the food in. we dont get samples over here (wink wink)....
Have you guys changed anything in the Limited Ingredients Diet Green Pea and Duck dry cat food? My cat has IBD and was doing great on it, but 2 months ago the kibble pieces were a different color and thinner... A few weeks later, loose stools started, and now she's having full-blown diarrhea.
Are there plans to create a dry cat food version of L.I.D. Limited Ingredient Diets VENISON & GREEN PEA FORMULA? My cat is eating this wet food exclusively, but it would be helpful to supplement with a dry food at times without introducing a different protein.

We know our vendors are busy ordering seeds and prepping for Market season, but what gardening plans do you have for 2011? Starting any plants inside?
So looking forward to seeing all our wondeful customers! I was thinking of you when i was seeding all those flowers and tomatoes today!
i just can't wait for spring and the farmers market
Any expert composters out there? Any tips to share to start composting at home? Spring would be a great time to "go green" and try it out!
Just 70 days until the first farmers market! I can't wait!!

Current fave way to start the morning: water from one Thai coconut with 2 tbs Healthforce Spirulina Manna. So sweet. #highvibrationbrekkie
Feel empty clean milk jugs with fresh drinking water for drinking and or cooking. Fill a bathtub with water fort toilet flushing before a major storm in case the power goes out.
Put a few gallons of water in empty milk Jugs in your deep freezer. If the electricity goes out it will extend the length of time that the freezer stays cold and when it melts you've got a few more gallons of drinking water. 
Learn to start a fire without matches, and have flint and steel available.
besides all the obvious things, like water, food, cloths, I think thje most important thing one should do is sit down with all the family members and discuss WHAT TO DO if an earthquack hit or if a tonado hits, go over what to do when something goes wrong and write it down take a day and drive to the meeting places review the routes make sure the kids know what tod and where to go to get picked up, example would be if something happens everyone goes to grandmas house and if you can't go to grandmas house everyone meets at the hospital, go over these again and again and make sure that ALL the relatives have the same plan so they know to go there and get in touch, don't talk about it once and then forget about it, write it down and laminate and hang it on the fridge and make sure each family has a copy. take all the guess work out of it know exactly where everyone is going to be
Everybody always forgets the toilet paper!!!!
In areas that are prone to flooding, use empty bread bags to slip your feet into and then into your shoes to keep your feet dry. Also works great on hikes if you fall into deep water. 
Make sure that everyone who works outside the home has emergency preparedness in their car, and their briefcase or backpack, especially a whistle and water.

Had my 2 shelter rescues on Taste of the Wild for about a year and wasn't satisfied. Lorelai(the oldest) had horrible itchy paws Lucy(the newest addition) ALWAYS seemed like she was hungry and both had the worst gas known to man! Following the suggestion of our obedience trainer we switched to Canidae about a mo. ago and I couldn't be happier. No more itchy paws, THE GAS IS %99 better(we still have some small toots) and I can not believe that I feed them LESS food and they are completely satisfied. So thrilled that we were told about this food!
Question-if my dog is not real active should I not be feeding him the grain free pure elements dog food. I just read todays blog article and it mentioned that it could make a more inactive dog put on weight. I changed him to this food to see if it could help with his skin/ear issues. Thoughts?
I am feeding our rescue the grain free salmon canned, she is on another brandy dry (but I'm thinking of switching) and she loves it, and it agrees with her tummy with is GREAT! 
I'm thinking of trying out your brand ad a recommendation from a friend. Are they any online coupons or promotions that I can take advantage of?

I've just started giving my 4 months old poodle x maltese Canidae ALS grain free pure elements. Am wondering, whether is it too much protein for him? He weighs 3.8 kg - feed twice a day total of 1 cup. Would love some advise... TQ :)
Thank you Canidae for your support of Shade Tree Kennels at the International Sportman's Show in Sacramento, CA last week. We were buried with people wanting to talk about your fantastic dog food (and see our Pointing Labradors) and based on the amount of samples and literature we gave out hopefully many will be switching to your wonderful products. We're so excited to be associated with such a wonderful product and company. Many, many thanks! 
My elderly Saint Bernard and young Cockapoo both thrive on Canidae food. Cant express enough at what a difference it has made to my elderly Saint and to my family. He began having seizures of unknown origin about three years ago, seemingly out of the blue and would sometimes have up to ten a day--very dramatic, lasting more than 60 seconds and he weighs 135lbs. After testing for everything and getting him on some antiseizure meds--started preparing all of his meals myself and his seizures dropped to about once a day---after doing this for almost 6 months, my groomer suggested Canidae--I was exhausted from prepping all of his meals and gave it a try---honestly, he has been eating for almost two years now and has a few seizures a month!....
You are changing your grain free canidae bags and name?
Canidae needs a Grain Free Treat!
We love love love your food! I have 2 dogs on the senior formula my sheltie lost 10 lbs the first year that we started feeding him canidae, my shepard also loves the senior formula. I have 3 cats that LOVE the chicken felidae and their coats have never looked better! I had issues with 1 of my cats not wanting to eat everyday until I switched to felidae. Do you ever offer coupons? 
Hello, our cats love Felidae grain free cat&kitten!! But I live in Germany and I can`t get this food in any shop since 1-2 months. Can you tell me, when this food is available in Germany again? Thanks a lot for you answer!!
When is the new simple grain formula hitting stores?
Bandit loves the Canidae Lamb and Rice formula, it gives him the energy for frisbee training!

I just ate almost this entire stir-fry pan full of food--the kind of lunch that happens when I get tired of salads!
Did you know that purple sweet potatoes look tie-dyed when you slice them? At least these do!

Sometimes love just happens, like this accidental heart-shaped snowball. Happy Valentine's Day!
Thanks to the 190+ of you who took the time to give me your opinion about my blog header. To be clear, I was thinking of changing the header only--the top part where the name of the blog appears. No matter what, there will always be photos of the recipes.... (continued below)
If you're looking for a sweet Valentine's treat that's low in fat and sugar, try these maple-sweetened cookies:
Daughter just came in asking me to make chickpea salad. I agreed to show her how to do it. We combined a couple of my recipes so it's close to this one but without the seaweed (we were out of it). SO GOOD! Thanks for the great lunch idea, E!
Here's a hearty tortilla soup that I posted last year when I was transferring my website's archives, a job I'm still working on.
This polenta lasagna from 2007 is one of my all-time favorite recipes--and a great way to eat your greens:
I'm working on posting the recipe I teased you with yesterday. Meanwhile, enjoy this bok choy & quinoa dish from 2008:
If you're indulging in something a little bit decadent for V-Day, you can't go wrong with Chocolate-Covered Cherry Pudding Cake, posted 2 years ago today.
2 years ago today, I was making this incredible (but not really fat-free) peanut mole:
5 years ago today, my daughter was eating this chocolate cake made with a secret ingredient that she hates. But could she tell?
Snowed in? Try this warming soup, posted back when my blog was a baby.
Interesting-looking buckwheat salad that uses sauerkraut and sesame seeds:
February is Roasted Vegetable Soup Month. Ok, I just made that up. But I seem to post a lot of roasted veg. soups in February. Here's one from 2008.
I've been craving smoked paprika dressing so I bought some asparagus to have this salad for lunch today:
If you missed yesterday's ridiculously easy soup recipe, look for it in the comments on this photo. Fat-free + gluten-free + low-carb + yum!
Kathy from Healthy Slow Cooking does it again with oats topped with baklava filling:
4 years ago today, I was bringing this basic pasta salad to a potluck:
Here's a delicious beet salad from Nava Atlas's upcoming book, Vegan Holiday Kitchen. I know it's delicious because I made, photographed, and ate it! Notice that it's oil-free, too.
This weekend I'll be posting links to healthier Valentines desserts, starting with these chocolate cookies:
Here are more Vegetables for Valentine's Day recipes, posted on this day in 2008:
I'm back to salad for lunch, but I'm keeping warm by eating it with this, my oldest-favorite lentil soup. Instead of spinach, though, I used escarole--about 3 cups of it.
5 years ago today I was getting over my fear of turnips:
Here's someone who's making black&gold Steeler-themed recipes, including my black rice pudding:
My Balsamic-Glazed Chickpeas and Mustard Greens are featured on VegKitchen today. Perfect healthy, cold-weather meal! Check it out.
You don't have to be a fan of any particular team to serve this black & gold salsa at your Superbowl party: 
It's warming up, but it's not too warm for this easy, curry-infused soup from Nava Atlas' Vegan Express:
Looking for a romantic but healthy Valentine's meal? Check out these entries in the 2009 Vegetable Love recipe contest!
Fair warning: I'm going to be posting some Valentine's desserts from years past & if you're off the flour & sugar like I am, you might not want to look.
Almond Joy Oatmeal sounds delicious! Reading the recipe makes me wish I'd put it in the crockpot last night:
Someone just wrote asking for a printer-friendly version of this swirly pancake recipe & I thought you might enjoy it for a weekend breakfast.
Here's another Valentine's recipe, a decadent cherry-chocolate pie that is (I'm sorry) far from fat-free:
It's a great time of year for root vegetables, so grab some turnips & try this recipe from 2007:
Check out Slow Cooker Carrot Cardamom Oatmeal and Strawberry Layer Cake Oatmeal posted today by Kathy of Healthy Slow Cooking:
This rich Thai soup, first posted in 2006, was recently featured in Colleen Patrick-Goudreau's Color Me Vegan:
4 years ago today, I was cooking these super-cute Thai eggplants. This peanut masala is one of my favorite dishes:
For V-Day, I will be making some of my family's favorite dishes, including my daughter's favorite soup--in a heart-shaped bowl, of course! What's on your menu?
3 years ago today, I was cooking two versions of steel-cut oats. Is it too late for breakfast? The photos are making me hungry!
Here are 3 more fat-free snacks you can nibble on with abandon while you root for whoever it is in the Superbowl:
An iPhone shot of my impromptu lunch, a ridiculously easy vegetable and dal soup. Cats love it, apparently.
So anyhow, I decided to call frontier today to discuss what my options were with regards to FIOS and direct tv migration. I have to admit that I am even more disgusted with this company. $26 dollar credit for Direct TV and a bundle price of $111 for the first year then $179 for the bundle pricing for phone internet and Direct TV for the second year. I mean really, how is this anywhere near competitive??? I want Verizon back!!!
I swear if there was another choice everybody would dumb this crap company in the blink of an eye. People here have had issues since before Thanksgiving and nobody has done anything about it. I also love that I can stream hulu fine, along with Frontiers junk service yet anything else is a joke, YouTube, Netflix, Justin.Tv, ESPN3, throttle much Frontier? Sorry excuse for a company.
13 Days left until I will be done with Frontier! I really hope this company regains it's sanity in the future. You have so much potential with FIOS if you dont destroy your company before you figure out what you're doing!
If possible would like to know when the situation in ohio might be fixed as I was told late Jan to Early Feb but as it has not happened yet would like to know a estimate. I am hearing the 17th for WV is this going to be the same for OH or should I expect a diffrent date?
Frontier employees enjoy helping the communities we live and work in 24/7/365! In honor of Random Acts of Kindness Day, our Central Region Team is taking it to the next level! Don't be surprised when the technician installing your FrontierFast HSI presents you with a gift or carries your groceries to the car. It's just what we do! Let us know if you were surprised by one of these random acts of kindness.
My family has worked for the initial company formally known as GTE, then through the Verizon transition, Now currently working for Frontier. My father in law is a 42 year Retiree and was rehired by Frontier. My husband has 12 years in the company and both love their jobs. When will there be positions available in our area to support our Minerva, Carrollton, New Philadelphia and surrounding areas that would be available for women...? I faithfully check the Job Search link to check for possible job positions in and around these areas. A suggestion to Frontier to have a position created to organize each surrounding area, maintain paperwork, support management, sales (calls and face to face) to alleviate technicians and construction departments from having to delay productive daily work of your employees. This would only help to better assist each and every customer to the best of their ability and in a timely manner. Your response is appreciated. Have a great day.

Many of these posts mirror what I/we go through on a daily basis. To others it's hard to understand. We aren't lazy or forgetful by nature. Chances are when we are doing really well there is a drastic difference. But when we are fatigued everything goes out the door and can be forgotten. Not due to lack of importance but simply because we aren't functioning as a whole.
Happy Valentine's Day to everyone and, more importantly, the loved ones that help us when Crohn's causes problems. Our health doesn't just affect us, it affects everyone around us.

I JUST GOT MY NICOLE LUNCH BAG.....IT IS BEATIFUL. THANKS LEAN CUISINE!!!!!
I got a late start with my codes for the bag (I just threw out all the boxes until my local store started to carry them...before I knew I could contact you...ooops! LOL) but since I eat nearly 5 a week, I'm only 4 away! Plz don't run out of bags!
Waaaah! No egg rolls yet at my Meijer. If anyone has extra codes, I would love have some! Yes, I am impatient and jealous of you that have your bags already!
got my lunch bag in the mail today.. its very nice thanks Lean cuisine.you rock.I am still entering codes for the next promo whatever it is.. Love your food.. 
EGG ROLLS!!!! IWANT!!!!! (wipes drool from corner of mouth)
Got my Nicole bag today, Thank you Lean Cuisine. Not bad considering I redeemed my 20 codes 1/24/11 I expect the closer it gets to the end of the promotion the longer thing will take though. 
I got my Jessica Bag today! Super FAST!!! I redeemed my codes Feb 1st! Thank You LC! I <3 it! 
I have emailed 7 times since Jan. 21st for my codes and have yet to hear a response. I have 13 codes in my account and 10 codes without boxes. I could have already had my bag. Anyone know how to get them to email you back? 
Your "Casual Cuisine" line takes me on a taste-venture to magic-snack-land. Also you should come out with an intravenous version of the Bacon Alfredo pizza, which happens to be the pinnacle of human achievement.
Got our lunch bag today. It is great. Looks like a real purse. Lots of room for food. Paper lunch bags are just too small.
not sure if I like the orange chicken....hmmmmm! 
Love your Sesame Chicken! CVS has Lean Cuisines on sale.
PATHMARK HAS THE LEAN CUISINE MEAL (INCLUDING THE STEAMABLE BAG MEALS) ON SALE FOR 6/$10.00
The Roasted Garlic Chicken with creamed spinach was HORRIBLE! -_- I was disappointed! On the other hand, I LOVE the garlic chicken pizza!
10 codes down 10 to go....anyone who got there bag already please post a pic! 
13 codes..I am on my way...
Got my bag today!! It is Beautiful and big just like a purse for real. I got the Jennifer, It's lovely and I am very pleased. Thank you Lean Cuisine!!!
just made it to 20 codes, hopefully getting my bag soon!! Thanks LC
I just entered code # 20 and ordered the 'Nicole' lunch bag. Yeah Me!! Thanks Lean Cuisine!
The garlic chicken spring rolls are so delicious!
OOOOOO I just tried the Market Creations Chicken Pot Stickers. Soooo tasty! You guys have REALLY improved your flavors and varieties! <3
I got my Ashley bag this weekend and it is great! I was really surprised when I opened the mailbox. The delivery estimate time was 8-12 weeks, so I wasn't expecting it until April! I was worried it was going to be too small for everything I take for lunch, but it is perfect! It holds a lean cuisine, a "one cup" sized container, a yougurt, bottled water, and a protein shake. I could still fit another small item or two in there if needed!
I heard we can get a free code for the bag?
Free code?! In struggling! Help!
I ordered the Jessica bag on 1-25 and still haven't received it. My neighbor also ordered the Jessica bag bt on 2-5 and she just got her's. I ordered mine about 2 wks before him and he got his. Would like to know where mine is! 
The Free Code is located under the January 11, 2011 post. Click Just Lean Cuisine and then scroll down to view the code under the January 11, 2011 post.
Lean Cuisine is THE ONLY frozen dinner in a box I will eat. So tasty and so helpful when you're concerned about portion control! Love you guys! 
Lean Cuisine the spring rolls are the bomb!!!! Great idea!!! I like all of them!! 3 spring rolls and a few packs of duck sauce makes a great snack!! Only 4 more codes to go to order my bag!! Yay!! Looking forward to getting a new bag!! The last bag I got a few years ago was really nice and I still use it!! 
LUNCH: Lean Cuisine Market Creations Asiago Cheese Tortilloni, Diet Cherry Dr. Pepper. YUMMY!!
My 2 year old son is a very picky eater but suprisingly he LOVES the Lean Cuisine spring rolls I buy for myself. He likes garlic chicken best. 
just ordered the "Nicole" lunch bag - yay :)
If I have 40 codes can I order 2 different bags? 
Just ordered my lunch bag! Yay!!!
Woo hoo! I got my Jessica lunch bag. I used to take my Lean Cuisine Apple Cranberry Chicken for lunch today. It's roomy enough to carry stuff for my mid morning and mid afternoon snacks, too!
I have to say, I am very happy with Lean Cuisine. I sent in info last night for 2 boxes and today I had an email waiting on me with the 2 codes.. way to go! now that's customer satisfaction!
I just got my "Nicole" lunch bag in the mail on Friday and I am impressed! So much larger then I thought it would be! Truthfully I wish I was able to get 1 more! Thanks Lean Cuisine! :)
I'm working on geeting a bag. Ineed 9 more codes. does anyone have any extra they would'nt mind sharing. I will appreiciate it very much. you can leave me a message in my message box on FB. Im using the meals for my weight watchers & it is helping me. Aimee that is great. Is there a limit per person. I was wondering how big they are.. I do like the Jennifer bag. there...
just ordered my Jessica bag cant wait for it to get here now. 
Garlic Chicken Spring Rolls! Yum!!! Don't ever stop makin' em! :)
Is there a list somewhere of whick LC have the codes? We've gone through tons and only have 4 codes. I'm sure it's been well over 20 now.
Just ordered The Jennifer! For all that have received theirs already, is it really taking 8-12 weeks to receive? 
I have a code from my lunch.. dos anyone want it?
I am one code from getting my lunch bag. I want the Jennifer bag. does anyone have an extra code. I will appreiciate it very much. you may message me in my box on fb.
I am two codes away .... and then I will get my lunch bag ... I want the Jennifer too. This means a trip to the store, as I didn't keep the box lids on two that came without codes!
My lunch bag arrived damaged, the bag is was shipped in looks to have been sealed with heat and whatever was used to seal it also burnt the seam of my lunch bag. I emailed customer service who referred me to another branch of customer service who is not answering my emails. I'm SO frustrated with this promotion. Anyone else have problems with their bag? 
Over a week ago I sent all info from boxes with no codes, still have not hear from LC. 
Love Lean Cuisine!! Just had spaghetti with meat sauce! Yummy!
just ate Beef and Broccoli,, I love their Meal and Calorie Plan!! yey
just ate the yummiest lunch!! I just had the Thai-Style Chicken Spring Rolls by Lean Cuisine. Thank You Lean Cuisine for an Awesome lunch!
<3's your new spring rolls!! Deeelicious and highly recommended! :) 
LC sent me all 8 of the codes I was missing! THANK YOU Lean Cuisine Customer Service! I just ordered my "Jessica" Lunch Bag!!! 
Ok Lean Cuisine, I have been a faithful customer. Please don't prove me wrong. I just inputted 6 codes and every one of them was wrong. And now I have to wait 5 to 7 days to figure this out? There is a flaw in the printing of the codes. You have N's that look like K's, or is it the reverse? and a character that is either the letter O or the number 0. I tried both on all and got kicked out for too many attempts. I am so disappointed!
Only the pizzas at my grocery store have the purse codes on them, but I really want to buy the other flavors and more "dinner" entrees... is it possible to get replacement codes like others are talking about for the boxes that don't have the purse logo on them?
I'm curious- if it takes a while to get codes we are missing because of boxes we purchased not having them, what happens if they don't get to us in time before the deadline or you run out of products? I am seeing some comments from people saying it's been a few weeks. 
I received my 6 missing codes, but what's the use? THEY DO NOT WORK. Seems like this offer is an advertising gimmick. Lean Cuisine needs to have a customer service phone line. This asynchronous email method is not working and is very UNsatisfying!!!
I finally got two codes in an email but now I can't enter them online...I keep getting "an error has occurred" message. 
Cant enter codes!
I haven't been able to get logged in to enter codes since last night. :-(
Your offer is very frustrating, codes are missing from purchases made within your time frame and an error code apears when trying to enter codes
So frustrated. I have 20 codes but can't get on my account to order a bag. This happened to me at the beginning of last month. I had 3 codes in but ended up reregistering under a different email. I ended up losing those codes.
I get a kick out of the people who don't like others "complaining" about not getting "free" stuff. The gist of the promotion is customers buy LC products (which we are doing), enter codes (which we are not getting), and submit them for a PROMOTIONAL GIFT (which we can't redeem for cuz we can't get codes or log onto the website to ask for codes). Nothing is FREE. It's a Marketing campaign that we pay for a product and expect the premium. I'm sorry we're annoying you expecting a company the size of LC to have adequate customer service. You're either A) not participating or B) happily wasting your money and content you're being taken.
OK LC, this is what I suggest. Everyone of us who have responded because we cant decipher our codes, cant get them entered because the page is down or because we are buying LC without codes and cant get a code from you......just go ahead and send us our lunch bag to make up for our trouble and wasted time. Thank you so much in advance.
I just called Lean Cuisine and told them that I didn't have codes on most of my boxes. They were more than happy to help me and I am getting credit for all those that didn't come with a code. The # to call for this is 1-866-883-1492. Good luck everyone :)
I finally found the Salmon with Basil....had it for lunch, It's sooooooo good!!!!
Love love LOVE the thai spring rolls. I feel like I'm really getting a treat when I eat them. :)
I have my codes entered...how do you redeem them?
I think the new egg rolls make up for everything!
I have 20 codes entered but no where do I see a place to redeem the codes for a bag. What gives?
I <3 LC Four Cheese Pizzas!!! I could eat one every day!!! Seriously!!! I can't wait to get another LC bag especially since they have one made just for me this time!!! LoL!
Thanks for fixing the errors, got my last codes in and lunchbag ordered! It was a little confusing to figure out how to order the bag, but if you click 'view the lunch bags', and click details, you should see a link to 'order this bag' or something like that on the bag pictures - just fyi for the ones below trying to order theirs, and now I see others posted it too, but heck, hope it helps.
still haven't gotten my codes I sent the email last week, but if anyone has extra codes message them to me please... My boxes don't all have codes.
anyone have extra codes to share? lol... 
is giving a shout out to her favorite weight loss product/company.......i love LC and feel full and satisfied after each meal. (please come up with some breakfast items.....i feel so disloyal buying WW egg scrambles.....but i can only take so many potato and broc cheese for breakfast).
Hey I finally figured out what I thought was the letter O on the code was actually a D.. wow that was a lucky guess.. It does not look like it. so try if you are having trouble..
I have found 2 boxes without codes so far. I emailed the info asked for and LC sent me a code via email in a week. I'm waiting on my second code. Don't give up guys! I sent them the entire UPC code # and all the #s stamped on the grey panel on the side including spaces plus the type of meal. I'm just hoping a eat enough LC before they run out of bags!
trying to stay warm today wearing a comfy sweater... and having the meatloaf and mashed potatoes comfort cuisine for lunch. :) 
Has anyone else had problems with their codes? I had about 8 entered already and when I went to add two today they were all GONE from my account. Suggestion.. log your codes and enter at once b/c apparently I have to start all over 
Just had the garlic chicken spring rolls, it was DELICIOUS! I shared with a co-worker and after tasting I wish I would have kept the second serving to myself. YUMMY!
So what happens if you get a box without a code, you just are left out? 
Eek! I just opened my lunch and found a long hair under the cellophane of my meal! :(
I swear.. hands down my favorite is the Lasagna..lol... It's so good.. Between that and the Chicken Alfredo
Can I get more than one free bag????? Because I have already got my first one ordered and I eat lean cuisine alot so I am getting more codes. So can I use them for a second one????
not for this company but in a pasta dish in the box i found rat poo never shoped at super store since
I just got an email with all the codes I was missing... now I cant figure out how to order the bag.. but, I will figure it out tomorrow. The only thing I dont like about lean cuisine is that they dont have the updated weight watchers points plus on them. Come to find out, the old point system says 5 points and I input it in weight watchers and now its 7 points! I hope lean cuisine is planning on catching up with the weight watchers new points. I like lean cuisine much better than the smart ones...
I love the garlic chicken spring rolls. They're so yummy!
I sent my email with the information from the boxes on January 8 and I still haven't gotten any codes. Did I do something wrong?
Been feeling like this free lunch bag thing is a gigantic ploy. I have tried to enter codes and error message, send emails regarding missing codes, no response. I have bought these products for YEARS and feel like maybe I should stop..... 
I wish I could actually log in and put the codes in.
Wondering what went wrong at LC that they promoted this lunch bag thing, yet there are so many boxes that were printed without codes in them. Like others have posted, I sent an e-mail last week about a missing code and got the reply asking for the timestamp info, which I sent. The very next day, I opened another box with no code and sent them that info, as well. Yesterday's box had a code, but again today's has no code. Wondering if it's really even worth it at this point since they are so "overwhelmed" with it all.
Am a little frustrated that the Lunch Bag site has crashed AND that there are so many boxes without codes in them. 
Those new garlic chicken egg rolls are soooooooooooo goood!
I am totally frustrated with that Lunch Bag promotion. Blah blah blah....we are sorry....we are aware of the issues...... No codes in boxes... When you actually do have a code you can't always tell the difference between some letters and numbers...is it a "d" or a "zero" or an "o". I've requested codes from 4 boxes without codes and received only one code....it's been WEEKS. How many hoops do you want us to jump through? 
Has anyone else tried to put a code in today? That portion of their website is not accessible due to the interest in the lunch bag promo. Not the press you want. I wonder if the 3/31 deadline will be extended maybe that would calm the chaos at LC I am about ready to forgo the lunch bag and jump to Healthy Choice Steamers!
A little frustrated with the lunch bag promotion. I stocked my freezer full and a lot of the packages have no codes. Now I have a code and the website is down. Bummer.
I JUST RETURNED FROM THE GROCERY STORE TODAY 02/04/11. I PURCHASED 7 LEAN CUISINE SIMPLE FAVORITES ENTREES, ONLY TWO BOXES HAD CODES. I DO NOT HAVE CODES FOR FIVE BOXES. IS THIS LEAN CUISINE'S TRICK TO GET PEOPLE TO BUY? I PREVIOUS SENT A EMAIL ABOUT THREE BOXES THAT DIDN'T HAVE CODES, I ONLY RECEIVED A CODE FOR ONE. SO I AM TOTALING 9 BOXES THAT DO NOT HAVE CODES. 
You know what would be pleasant? If we could just get a discount and buy the lunch bag... Id buy em in the store...lol
I recently tried the thai-style chicken spring rolls.... love them!!!!
I'm proud to say I got my email w/the codes today & input them into my account and promptly ordered my cute "Jennifer" lunch bag. Thank you Lean Cuisine. Blessings as you work to make sure everyone receives their codes and is able to complete the process of ordering their bag.
I having Salmon with Basil tonite!!!
I love the lunch bag promotion, and yes, I too have had several boxes with no codes. However, my real complaint is the quality of the codes! I know technology exists out there to make the codes legible! They are just too darn hard to read! N looks like W and H looks like K!!! What gives?
still looking for garlic chicken spring rolls :=?
I ahve recently started a diet and move toward healthier living. So, I am buying A LOT of Lean Cuisine (I love, love, love the french bread pizzas and spring rolls). In these tightening the belt days, where can I find some coupons for Lean Cuisine products?
Thai Style Chicken Spring Rolls awesome!
Got an email with 10 codes today. I emailed LC after not receiving codes after my first request. They sent them to me within a day!
The "o's" are "D"s...now my codes will enter!! Yeah!
Is anyone else having trouble ordering their bag? I entered my 20 codes over the course of a month, and my account says I have 20 codes, but there doesn't seem to be a clear way to "order". I have been looking all over the dang website and have contacted lean cuisine twice. They don't seem to understand my question and just keep sending me more codes! I even tried a different internet browser. Please, anyone who has ordered, I'd appreciate your insight. I'm am not an idiot! LOL.
None of the codes work on our boxes, and my mother has sent an email a few weeks ago with no response. What is the deal??
Tried the garlic chicken spring rolls! They are awesome! 
How about some whole grains? I love LC pizzas, but it would be wonderful to have an option for whole grain (NOT made with whole grain) crusts...
I just received an email from customer service (I emailed them with box information last week) giving me my replacement codes, and then placed my order for a bag! Thanks Lean Cuisine! 
I just had a spinach, artichoke and chicken panini for lunch! SO GOOD!!!! <3
Love your pizzas, my favorite lean cusine meal. But lately, your plastic wrappers have been awful to open. I assume they have changed, but its for the worse. I'm usually stabbing at the plastic instead of being able to use the pull apart tab. Makes for a great scene in the office break room. Hahaha.
There is more than enough sauce in the meals so I can toss extra vegetables in and bulk up the meal. Had the Chicken Alfredo today with a lot of added broccoli and it was delicious. 
Finally got my codes today after an email I sent 22 days ago. I guess later is better then never! Just wanted to give ya'll with the code issue a heads up!
I received my codes today only 1 week after submitting my complaint on their site; I couldn't have asked for better service. Tonite I ordered my lunch bag.
i still havent gotten my codes and it has been several weeks!
I love their pizza's, most are 300 calories and are healthy, tasty and filling for lunch. If you are dieting, and at work, skip the fast food, grab one of this and nuke it for 3 minutes, Done!
***TO LEAN CUISINE***Will you please forward my entire Facebook post to your marketing department? I greatly appreciate it! First of all, I want to tell you that I really LOVE your lean cuisine meals! I love them even more since you put them on SALE! Please keep lean cusine's prices low and afforable! ***SUGGESTIONS*** I have 3 suggestions please. Will you please consider making a lot of breakfast foods and dessert options too? Also, will you please make some NEW Pizzas with ALFREDO SAUCE for those of us who do not like to eat tomato sauce on pizza because of the high acidity and heartburn effects--such as a NEW Pizza with "pepperoni, mushrooms, garlic, and alfredo sauce"! It is so delicious this way and I am sure a lot of your customers will love it! =) Thanks so much and have a great day! =) Tonya in VA near DC
Got my final codes from Lean Cuisine today, it took 10 days. That gave me 20 and I ordered my lunch bag. Yeah!!!
I finally got my codes from the email I sent them on January 8. I think they were lost so I resent the info last week and they rushed out the codes! Thanks!
Well trust has paid off for once. Maybe kharma does work. Got more than enough codes to complete the order. Yay LC!!! Thanks for following through on your promise.
got 21 codes..can not for the life of me figure out how to get the free bag.....
I just had theTortilla Crusted Fish with rice, poblano peppers & corn in a sour cream sauce. It was AWESOME. One of the best I've had yet!! thanks Lean Cuisine :D
I am addicted to the Sesame Chicken! They are like tasty little chicken nuggets!
I love the food. Hate that most boxes in my area have NO codes. Free bag doesn't seem worth it any more!
I just had the Garlic Chicken Spring Rolls. Love these!
Woo hoo! I finally got all of the codes needed and I ordered my lunch bag today. :)
Lean Cuisine has completely changed my eating habits and helped me become a better me! I LOVE Lean Cuisine! They're just so darn tasty!
Wow.. I didnt know there were codes in my box.. :(..now i have to start all over..I hope I get 20 b4 this offer ends..
I am still getting tired of all the boxes that don't have codes. Anyone got codes to spare?
hey LC, what surprise do you have for us in April? I'm still looking for those delicious looking Garlic chicken rolls
I would like some spare codes if anyone can share. I only have three numbers right now so I have a way to go. Just send me a message. thanks
yeah!!!! Got my 20 codes in 6 weeks!!!! 
We have a page for dieting tips, advice, sharing encouragement and accomplishments. Please "like" us and come share your successes over at Slim Seekers
i need three more codes and guess what they arent on the boxes
Had the Thai Style Noodles with Chicken. Delicious. I want a bottle of that sauce!
Hey everyone and LC! I just wanted to say Thanks!! On Jan 3rd, I decided to change my life and get healthy and skinny again! My goal is to lose 25 pounds. 6 weeks into my "diet", I have lost 7 pounds! YAY! Its not difficult to stay on point this time around (i have tried to diet before). In the morning I drink a Slim Fast, for lunch I have a Lean Cuisine Meal, and I eat a sensible dinner. To keep track of everything, I use the website and app Lose It - calories in and calories out! For anyone out there who thinks you just can't do it - YOU CAN!!! :D
i opened three more boxes today and got no codes
a couple weeks ago a free code was posted on here. does anyone remember it? please let me know if you do. thanks so much.
Thanks for the codes LC!
I really loveeeeee Lean Cuisine!!!!!!!!! I went to make my lunch today a chicken enchilada meal. The enchilada was missing. They are replacing the meal! Thanks LC. 
I really want to try the new Chicken Poblano, Chicken Pot Stcikers, and Garlic Chicken Spring Rolls but none of the stores in my area sell them. I even did a search on the LC website to see which stores in my area sold them and none do. Please send stock some in the 37388 zip code area!
Thanks for the Philly cheese Panini - Love it! 
Sent in 8 coupons on 1/13- got one code emailed today. Hoping there are 7 more on the way...
the new garlic chicken spring rolls are to die for! So delicious....
What are these codes of which you all speak? I would love to know how to save some money on LC's since they are a weekly staple on my grocery list! 
Just discovered the parmesan crusted fish! amazing!
Just the cheese pizza? THE BEST FROZEN PIZZA EVER! Forget the fact it fits perfectly into my diet! LOVE IT!! =) 
can't wait to try these new garlic chicken spring rolls I hope my Meijer store has them and I want to get a lunch bag (I'm gonna get the Jennifer....LOL) so I will be stoking up on LC hope I have room in the freezer! 
Thanks for the codes Lean Cuisine. You guys must be swamped!
Thanks, Lean Cuisine! I purchased 12 meals on Jan 2, and 8 of them didn't have codes. Your customer service team responded to my email within 24 hours and sent me all 8 missing codes! As a marketer, I can sympathize with promotions that don't always go exactly as planned. I appreciate your efforts to rectify the situation. You have created a happy, loyal customer. :) (And remember, it costs 5 times less to keep a current customer than to find a new one!) 
I have been trying for the last month to get codes for 4 boxes that didn't have them. I have sent e-mail after e-mail with the information they requested and still have yet to hear anything about this. I'd like to know what's going on and if I will be getting those codes? 
finally got the codes sent to me A MONTH later... but i jus ordered my jessica bag :)
thank you for my codes lean cuisine!
now that I have my codes entered - where do you order the lunch bag??
So I tried the Garlic Chicken Spring Rolls for the first time yesterday and Yumm! I am a fan. The fact that there are two servings in a box and that they are only 200 calories is even better!!! 
Lemon pepper chicken is awesome!
I just saw the free bag promo and think it is wonderful!! As a woman I find it so hard to find a nice stylish handbag that also works as a lunchbag. Thank you so much!!!
not to brag or anything but I emailed LC this morning to get a missing code and they just emailed me back...that was quick since I have seen lots of complaints. THANK YOU LC for being so quick for me :)
Okay Lean Cuisine, I officially give up. After 41 days of being generally ignored, 8 e-mails, 11 missing codes, and one phone call to an extremely rude customer service person who told me to wait for a call back and go buy more meals and eventually I would find some with codes, I give up. No lunch bag for me and no more lean cuisine in my house. I know it is just one house but I bet I am not the only one with these problems.
The new meals are wonderful, BUT, the packaging is so unecessariliy bulky that I cannot buy enough for a week because I cannot store them in my freezer.
fettuccine with spinach, broccoli and red peppers..is fantastic
Just tried the GARLIC CHICKEN SPRING ROLLS....I was very impressed, the crisping sleeve worked well and they had a great taste!!! Thanks Lean Cuisine :)
the new CHICKEN POBLANO is fantastic! Thank you for thinking of us SPICY customers!
I got my 20 codes as of 2/11/11! I can't find anything on the website about ordering my bag or...do they contact me?? 
I just ordered my bag today...thanks!
this post has NOTHING to do with the codes i just want to know if anyone has lost weight using lean cuisine? how much and how long did it take you? THANKS!!!
Ok, everybody's been talking so much about how great the garlic chicken spring rolls are, so I got some. Just sat down with them and OMG!! These are sooo yummy - and I don't even like spinach!! I plan on stocking up on these little suckers!! :) Oh, and there was actually a code in the box - LOL!
does anybody like the Bacon Alfredo Pizza?I love this pizza but have hard time finding..Does anybody else have trouble finding?
Does anyone need more codes? I have a couple extra left
I am eating the Herb Roasted Chicken with potatoes and broccoli florets for lunch right now. It has one tiny piece of broccoli in the whole thing. A little disappointing!!
Dear Lean Cuisine, I am really excited about your lunch bag promotion! If it's not enough that I was getting rewarded for what I already eat - I get to pick from a variety of styles for my lunch bag (which I will also use everyday to carry my lean cuisines). Thank you for this promotion and the wonderful, portioned food choices that you offer! Sincerely, your customer - Carolyn
Bought 3 LC meals at Walmart yesterday...made one for lunch today and NO code! :( And it wasn't Market Creations either.
Fajita style chicken spring rolls are the greatest!!
Got my email with the 7 missing codes- Just ordered my lunch bag :)
this sucks within the month i have atein at least 20 leancuiseans and not one box had a code can someone tell me how to get them
Lean Cuisine's customer service has been EXTREMELY prompt about giving me codes for the boxes that didn't have them. I have emailed them on 3 seperate occasions, and have received the codes within 1-2 days. I'm sure they're getting bombarded...Great job Lean Cuisine! 
my lunches this week....LC Tortilla Fish w/Pablono rice, Chicken Enchilada w/ rice, Spinach Mushroom Pizza and Beef Tips in Burgandy sauce with brocoli. I loved them all. Tahnk you for the wondferful lunches LC.
Customer Service has redeemed themselves. After repeatedly trying to reply to the email I got last month with the info for the 8 missing codes, I resubmitted a new case the other day and got all 8 replacement codes the next day. My advice to anyone who is still waiting for a reply to a query they sent in January....send it again. Looks like Customer Service is finally on the ball.
I have had no problems getting a response from them with boxes with no codes. They have responded to me within 1 - 2 days of me sending them my problem. I even had a error code and they respond quickly. 
I love the garlic chicken spring rolls. Delicious!!!
Thai-Style Chicken Spring Rolls=The Bomb!!!
A big Thank You for your great service on boxes without codes! I have always liked your products and it's great to know you care about your customers. THANKS!!

I'm concerned about my local Ross Store in Spokane Valley, WA.....Every time I walk in, it seems there is less and less inventory. I shared my concerns with the clerk, but don't feel like I got far. Why such a drastic drop in inventory? There is ABSOLUTELY nothing to look at in there anymore.
We just redecorated our living room from the Ross in Lawton, Oklahoma! Thanks so much for the great prices!!!
Looking for: DC Shoes Size: 8, 8 1/2 or 9 Womens Must be: Colorful or funky Price range: $24.99 or less (plus shipping)
Love this store!!! When are you going to start selling "Coach" products?
I went to the ROSS in Pittsburg, Ca and it was the worst ROSS I have ever shopped in, the the store was dirty, the merchandise was broken, not cleaned and I saw the security person stealing from the store! I told the shift manager about the horrible situation and she just rolled her eyes at me and said she couldn't do everything, so I spoke with two of the cashiers and told them to give me a number to call someone who cared. I came back 7 weeks later and it was a totally new store with a new manager and security personnel! Now the store is WONDERFUL and everything is in place. I thanked the new manager. Thanks ROSS for keeping your standards of good quality merchandise at great prices and employees who have pride in their job. I always shop at ROSS before going anywhere else and now I've got another reason why ROSS is my favorite store.
Wow, that is all I have to say about the Ross on Bell road in Phoenix, the one across the road from Target. I went there and I actually seen one of the employees eating pizza, or some kind of pasta, then while eating out in the open, she wipes her dirty hands on the womens shirts... yeah, I actually asked an employee who the store manager was because that was so gross and the employee pointed at THE WOMAN THAT WAS EATING! I was in shock. I had to even confirm that it was the main store manager, and sure enough... so disgusting. I like Ross and all, but that store isn't for me, I'll stick to the mall ross's.
I work @ the kennewick wa ross & i am so excited about how much this store has improved over the past year we have a great team managing the store & customers are constantly complimenting how much it has improved. It is nice to feel a sense of pride in my workplace..Thanks jason kay & mike great job!!
Is there a date for the Rogers AR store yet?
This evening, found two beautiful brand new queen size comforter sets and two huge firm pillows for the same amount as just one regular priced queen size comforter set! Eso es muy estupenda!!!!

Thank you Modmarket for wonderful catering for my neighborhood party last night! The Edamame hummus was fantastic as was the Curry Split Pea Soup, Thai Coconut Salad and Beef Skewers. Lots of compliments and future customers! 
borders going out in 29th st. huge sale. buy some books on the cheap, then come at Modmarket tonite
The weekend busy-ness exposed lots of weak points in our operations, therefore huge speed of service focus this week, I think we can get 30% faster. Let the optimizing and tweaking begin!
Is it too late to win dinner? Here is a picture I took of a delicious Chicken Parmigiana Burger from Moo Burger in Sydney, Australia when i was there in Nov 2010.

have an idea to reward our super customers (people who eat at Modmarket all of the time). creating a little icon with a date stamp that will go on the back of every receipt at Modmarket. Collect 20 of them and you get a free Modmarket T shirt. We have a few customers who could easily get a T shirt a month with this....
and our 900th fan is....drumroll please.....Susan Cassell ! A free lunch is coming her way as a reward.

Win free valentine dinner tonite at Modmarket - post a picture of your sweetheart and tell us why they are awesome. we will pick 3 couples for free dinner.
Sorry if u came in yesterday or today & we were out of something, the perils of having so much perishable food, sometimes we just run out!
every single growing region that supplies food to Modmarket has gotten crushed by weather this year - illustrates the importance of having a supply chain that is flexible - the same flexibility that allows us to use local produce in the summer also allows us to edit our menu in extreme weather times like this and avoid air shipping in our food, something we avoid at all costs

new favorite quote 'in business, if two partners agree on everything, one of them is useless'. judging by my relationship with Rob, neither one of us is useless!

Ate at pizzeria basta in boulder tonite. They really make an amazing pizza.
someone just sent us this, apparently Modmarket is popular with cats
We just celebrated two years together and he still makes me laugh, rubs my back when I'm cranky, and is just all around awesome. Also, as demonstrated by this photo, he's such an amazing History Teacher that he lets his students dress him up in dead muppets in the name of learning. September High School is lucky to have a teacher who sacrifices his dignity daily just so his students will remember things like which civilization invented the sundial.
Whenever I think I cant love him any more than I already do, he finds some way to do something amazing and make me love him even more. Cooper is awesome in so many ways- but I love how he not only loves and stands by me but he does the same for my family. Recently my sister underwent surgery and Cooper made sure he cleared his schedule and was there all day to support her- which involved sitting in a hospital waiting room for an entire day! He is awesome because he has the biggest heart of anyone I know!!

I watched footage of the animal testing that is associated with Proctor and Gamble today. I'm not one to cry, but was in absolute tears at what I saw. It was horrific.
