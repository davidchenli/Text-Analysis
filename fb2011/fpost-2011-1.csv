This month saw Mary's Meals begin at 21 new schools in Malawi. We held a 'handover ceremony' at Nansengwe Primary School to mark the completion of our new kitchens and to hand over their keys.
Very happy and proud to have Mary's Meals to be the recipient of my ''giving back'' efforts from my art. Henceforth 10% of every sale will go to Mary's Meals. A wonderful and deserving organisation, keep up the MARVELOUS work. 
FYI, at the moment {11:30 at night Boston USA time}, if you google Mary's Meals you see the links but when you click on any of them, backpacks, donate etc.} you get 123-Reg and this message. ''123-reg has registered this domain for one of its customers. If it's your domain name, you can manage it by logging in. '' The US site link is fine. Just thought I should tell someone. Thanks!

London volunteers piped in the haggis at a fantastic Burns night event last week. Congratulations to everyone involved.

How can i get the Betty Crocker calender? 
Here is a bean-less chili recipe used ground beef a collection of different colored peppers (red yellow orange green) onion...cans of crushed tomatoes, cans of chopped tomates and if needed tomatoe paste to thicken. chili powder to flavor until I like it. If you desire it really hot use some hotter peppers in the mix. Brown the ground beef, use the grease to sautee the peppers and onions then add the cans of tomatoes and seasonings if more spice is wanted try using crushed red peppers. Season till you like. Then here is the kicker a bottle of coke it cuts the acid and sweetens it just enough plus the cinnamon in coke gives it flavor too. Not pepsi but Coke-I cook for a huge family and try to have enough for left over so if I would give you my amounts it may scare you. Top it with cheddar cheese or what ever. Now if you are a real meat fan use beef cubes normally held for stew while browning them (and the ground beef too for that matter) season with the chili seasoning
popcorn and chex snack
About the m&m party its would be neat to make a choclate cake with colored frosting or fondant then use white m&ms to put the M in the center then press m&ms in the side may take sum time but it would look real cool

Seen on tv yesterday that you can substitute a can of diet soda in place of egg and oil (to make it lesser in fat and calories) in any boxed cake mix and still come out with a great cake? Anyone ever heard of this or tried it? Diet coke for a chocolate cake and 7Up maybe for Vanilla?

I am a cancer patient and my dietitian wanted me to eat Quinoa. (a grain that is really high in protein) She gave me a recipe to make it that sounded disgusting. I went on my trusty Betty Crocker.com website and found Creamy Quinoa Primavera. I made it with low sodium broth, low fat cream cheese, unsalted butter and for veggies I used 2 bunches of asparagus cut in 1 inch lengths and 1 red bell pepper chopped. It was soooooo good! Thank you Betty Crocker! You made something that is healthy for me taste delicious! =) My family loved it, too and they usually resist vegitarian meals! 
thank you so much for my calendar - I really needed it and I <3 it!!!

Every summer that we visited our grandmother in Iowa, she would have banana nut bread with Philidelphia cream cheese, she also had rhubarb crunch waiting for us, It didn't matter what time we got there, it was always waiting, and this was in the middle 50's to late 60's, so there were no cell phones. Bo my vote goes for Grandma's banana nut bread, which unfortunately, died with her.
Pumpkin - but blueberry would be a close second.

I used the reduced salt brown gravy mix and half a packet of ranch. It looks like too much rub when you make it, but it isn't, just throw the extra mix in the pot. I cooked it for 5.5 hrs on low, then turned it up to hi for 2 hours/
looks like you have some admirers in Sweden

Sam Chaltain, who has read at Busboys and Poets, said: Like so many others, I didn't realize there was another way to imagine the chronicling of the American narrative, or the construction of history itself, until I first read Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States. Once I did, my understanding of the world was forever changed.

What has Carla been cooking? I cooked for a birthday party event and made a classic french dish, Coq au Vin.

Hey Gayray, wish you and the team at Asia Scenic a great 2011. I actually cooked a chicken green curry on NYE the way I learnt at the school and used the mortar and pestle which I picked up after my class :)

Hello! Quick question. Are you participating in the http://www.whymilk.com/pouronemore/ coupon? The coupon says "valid only at participating retailers" so I was just curious. Thanks much! -Kimberly

I'm trying out different dishes for my dairy allergic (and picky eater) child. So far, garlic cheese bread and pizza are the only successes. I was excited to discover my local whole foods store now carries Daiya. I was actually just going in to request that they carry it since I assumed they did not as it wasn't listed on your website as a retailer.

OLD Taco bell commercial
Eat May Know's (Bendemeer Market) foot-long sticks are the largest I have seen sold in Singapore. Crispy and light, the fritters taste best when dipped into soya bean milk. 
Woh, Raffles City Basement reopens with so many exciting new food outlets. One of which is Soup Broth Asia, think 'Soup Spoon' served Asian style. *burps*
Breakfast at Sun Coffee Planet. I wonder how this new shop can survive with tasteless overcooked noodles with rubber char siew. And it's just two shops away from Killiney Kopitiam. All the best really!
Craving for Ampang Yong Tau Foo at Upper Thomson Road. Traditional goodness in a set which includes my favourites taupok, fried wanton, beancurd skin, bittergourd and lots of kangkong topped with killier delicious thick gravy.
Somehow eating cute Bunny Buns feels so wrong.
Elmo is happy that he has a Sausage Egg McMuffin McDonald's Breakfast Miniature Me. (And that's quite a mouthful.)
Located near the prominent Killiney Kopitiam, Sun Coffee Planet provides similar offerings such as toast/coffee and local delights. But very empty all the time. Why? 
Yomenya Goemon at Marina Bay Link Mall. The lunch sets are indeed value-for-money, with a half and half set of two spaghettis costing only $18++ with a soup and a can of soft drink. Plus it's delicious! 
Dessert Cup Luxurious parfaits, semi-frozen creams, crme brulee, cupcakes, granitas and even a lava cake in a Cup!
From Petaling Jaya to Cineleisure, this new claypot place offers a familys secret recipe, with few creative twists such as the Japanese style Tamago. And it's called "Wa3!"
I buy this Teochew Kueh almost every weekend. Dipped with dark sauce and chilli, the cakes brings back several fond childhood memories. There is also a pan-fried version where the outer layer will be fried fragrant and crispy. 
The Macau pork chop bun was firm on the outside, and soft on the inside. And what sets it apart from the rest was its tender and thinly cut pork chop, suitably marinated till sweet and juicy, and without a porky aftertaste. Found opposite Bugis Junction.

I am not a great fan of juicing, as it takes away the first part of the digestive process that involves actually chewing your food, but other than that I cannot think of a better advertisement for locally grown, all natural foods available at your farmer markets.
W are trying an independent funding option. I have already turned down a high six figure offer for this program as the executives wanted to soften the message about food, and add some conflict in the kitchen. I have been working on this for 5 years, have 8 seasons planned and the first season cookbook almost ready to go. $1 a piece would fund the entire series.
The first market visit in the New Year put a lot of very tasty winter greens on the table. I am off to a farm today to pick up some pastured beef and do a quick verification. I would like to get to every farm I get food from, but it is a long job.
This is a seven bone prime rib cut from Twin Creeks Ranch (the farm is not correct above" available at one of our local farmer markets in Houston from Pearl's Pastured Beef. http://pearlspasturedbeef.com/ This is some of the best tasting beef in this part of Texas and reminds me of some of the old English heritage breeds in texture and taste. 
If you are in the Houston area, about 40 of the top chefs in Houston and me, will be competing in the 10th annual chicken soup competition. I will be making the soup with ingredients from the local markets and farms, the best way of advertising how good our local produce can be. I just wish we had a local celery grower. Come by and spend a few minutes and a few dollars, all in a good cause.
For those in the Houston area, myself and many of the top chefs in Houston will be competing in the 10th Annual Chicken Soup Cook-off. Money to the Houston foodbank, and if you come by my booth, you will see the local produce that I use in my recipes.
With a little warning, your local farmers will often go out of their way to provide you with unusual needs. I was making 10 gallons of chicken soup for a cook-off benefiting the Houston Foodbank, and with four days notice, Doug put these aside for me to pick up at the Saturday market.
7 bone prime rib roast from Pearls" Pastured Beef, carrots and romanesco cauliflower (the green fractals on the left) fro Gunderson Farms. I eat the best when I eat from the local farmers.

Hey there Missy, I can't thank you enough for your recipe books!! It's such a relief to be able to serve up dinner plates to my 32 mth old boy, knowing that I don't have sto stress about whether he eats the "obvious" serves of vegies or not. ;) I was wondering whether you had considered putting together an app. for ipod/iphone/ipad? I would love to see one which allows the subscriber to utilise it in 3 ways: 1) Tick off their selection from your recipes, which then... 2) Links into a menu planner for the week, which then... 3) Creates a shopping list, which can be edited, according to what the subscriber already has "in stock" at home. If I had a 'puter with enough oomph, I'd try it myself, and send it to you to see what you think... So I thought I'd run it by you anyway. :) I look forward to your feedback, Thanks, Cheryl Gamble
Your not alone... Did you know that MOST kids are picky eaters?! But take heart--with a little sneaky creativity, you can actually get kids to LOVE their veggies! The solutions are easy, and moms are sharing theirs on Veggie Patch's Ultimate Sneak-Away Contest. http://on.fb.me/aTrlK9!

I have a son with Aspergers and he will not eat ANY fruit or veggies. i am thrilled to find your cookbooks i cant wait to try them!!
Just made all of the mixes for the first time! Tireddd lol
I just have to say, "THANK YOU!!!!" We have it made with our son, he loves his veggies! Then along came baby girl, the pickiest eater on the planet. I got your book a few days ago and have been tricking them both ever since...you're a miracle worker!!! =)
I just made your chocolate champion cereal cookies (i think that's what they're called) AMAZING. I am so impressed at how good they taste. I can't wait till my extremely picky eater wakes up from her nap... she will be the true judge ;) I made your mac and cheese the other day too, and probably put more cheese than necessary, but both kids and myself gobbled it up. Thank you!
Just had to tell you, yesterday i made Brainy Brownies. The kids devoured them, and asked formore. They had no idea there was spinach and blueberries in there instead of fat and sugar. Definately going to become a regular in this house. Thanks Sneaky Chef!
I received your cookbook for christmas and LOVE IT! My son has always been great about eating veggies, but my husband is another story! With your recipies we are all eating better!
I made a batch of the P B & J muffins and was greatly disappointed. I took them to a moms club play group to share with other moms and toddlers and the muffins received a 100% no vote. Including my picky eater. 
do you have any quick grab-n-go recipes for breakfasts? My kids are not only picky, but not big morning eaters, if at all. (I just wantm to head off into their day fueled up to learn)
I just made Extra Sneaky Strawberry Breakfast Ice Cream. A HUGE hit! And they are now snacking on chickpeas. :D
I'm an Undercover Mother this week. I can't wait to make my video and move on to the next part of the contest. I'm really hoping I win. Thanks for doing this contest with Veggie Patch!
I love my dollar tree on euclid in ontario,ca i went there on thursday and they had covergirl foundation there the same color i use. i bought 6 for the same price as just 1 at target (usually 5.99)thank you dollar tree 
I once went into dollar tree and asked for a price check.
Just wondering why the gift cards all look birthday themed. 
I must say, as a preschool teacher on a budget, Dollar Tree is my best friend!
Suggestion to Dollar Tree- There are certain products that people ask for all the time and I am wondering if we would be able to find a vendor to get these items for sale in our stores. The big one right now is Windshield Washer fluid. Second in line would be people asking for bags of salt for the slippery roads. (obviously need smaller bags). I have also noticed an increase in people looking for screws. Is it possible to get small boxes of multi-sized screws from someplace? In the summer, the demand seems to be up for Ice and Styrofoam coolers. Just figured I would ask if these things could be possible.
will Conway AR dollar trees be getting in on the "frozen foods" we where told this month that it was on the way and just a thought lol if you sold meat and eggs and butter WE would NEVER have to shop any where else EVER ijs lol
I won 4th place in the contest and just wanted to thank Dollar Tree and everyone that voted for my craft and hope there will be another contest because it was really fun!!
When we got married, my husband thought about telling people we were registered at Dollar Tree since I shop here so much. I got most of our crafts items for our wedding at Dollar Tree. 
I agree with you 100% yeah people are RUDE !!! but for the cashier to yell at a well behavied small child like she did was wrong, I shop at Dollar stores all the time and i've never seen anything like that ever before. what gives the cashier that worked there that day to yell at a child like that? do you have kids? well I do, and if someone yelled at my child like that I would be angry. People are rude all over not just at dollar stores. 
Update to those who are crossing their fingers/praying for me......my store manager applied at the new store going up in our district. i HIGHLY doubt she will get it (our dm doesn't care for her that much, and doesn't have much faith in her) BUT! if she DOES get it (i hope i hope i hope)...I applied for the SM position at MY store...which i REALLY want! i know i could do great things with my small store!
The Dollar Tree in Lincoln Square (Chicago) is a great store. When I got my own apartment, I spent way too much on stuff that I could have gotten at the Tree. Thanks for making the average person feel like a millionaire in your stores.
went to the dollar tree this morning in Millington at 11:00 just got home from a day of shopping and found out that I am missing several items from my purchase! Called up there to find out that there is no way I can get my items and I'm just out of my money!! I wouldn't be upset if it was just one item left out of the bag but I have several items missing and I spent $33.00 there. Needless to say I won't be shopping at that store anymore! 
I work at a Dollar Tree store in northern Pennsylvania; have worked there for several years. This winter it is very cold in our store. The temperature is controlled automatically by some kind of Novar system. We are not able to adjust it, nor is any store personnel authorized to call the control company and ask for an adjustment. Our store manager has requested service or adjustment via the computer several times, but nothing is ever done. 
Ha !!! LOVING Dollar Tree today !!!!!!!!! Just got my Kindle in the mail that I won from the Flair for Crafts contest on the Dollar Tree website :)
I enjoy doing these displays and making the store look good. It helps increase sales. :) I've worked in retail for 11 years now. I used to hate working it, but now I've changed my perspective again. When you have a great management team that works right along with you and a staff that works hard, it makes all the difference. Vicksburg loves their Dollar Tree store. Thanks.
Hey DT, I just wanted to share with you how much of a difference you made in some people's lives. We've been having terrible snow storms in the KC, Kansas and Missouri areas lately. I volunteer at a local rescue mission for the homeless and morale of the guests was really low. The mission asked for supplies and such so I was able to pick those up at DT. But, the really cool thing was finding awesome boxed sets of inspirational cards! They were of excellent quality and it made it very affordable to help the morale of the homeless in various recovery programs! Every one got a card with a puzzle page, stick of gum, and a water flavoring packet. ALL of this came from DT and while it may not seem like much to some people, to those who think the world has forgotten them or doesn't care, it meant a lot. You ROCK DT because going to Walmart would have probably cost ten times as much!
If any one is on here from the pittsfield store, don't go to work, zombies have taken over the store and all the surrounding as well. Stay tuned for updates.

A New Years suggestion for Restaurant.com - You send too many e-mails. I just unsubscribed... your company sends too many emails so I am unsubscribing. I's a shame because I enjoy the service but don't appreciate being bothered almost daily. Can you imagine what my In Box would look like if every company I did business with behaved like your company?

Restaurant.com is selling fraudulent coupons for restaurants that are not part of your program, specifically for Pi Kitchen + Bar in Anchorage, Alaska. The restaurant manager and server state they continue to have customers presenting coupons and that none of those coupons are being honored by the restaurant. We were told by staff that the restaurant has tried repeatedly since the summer of 2010, without success, to have their listing removed from Restaurant.com and to stop further sales - as the coupons will not be honored. Restaurant.com should immediately stop advertising/promoting sales of coupons for restaurants that are not part of the program, as continuing to do so is fraudulent.
Wondering if anyone knows what locations The Melting Pot has gift certificates on Restaurant.com??? I wish you could just search by restaurant...I like to plan our spontaneous trips based on what restaurants I can go to :D
You have certificates available for The Homestead Inn and The Rathskeller in Milan Ohio and they have both closed months ago.
People to People has a fundraiser going on and some of the restaurants available show the gift certificates are out of stock. How often are these gift certificates replenished?
Also...these make EXCELLENT gifts! Just give the receiving party a tutorial when you give the cert. and no I'm not a restaurant.com employee just a really happy customer 
Ocean Blue cuz its scrumpilicious!!!
i have been trying for an hour to look for restaurants on your site. The "operation aborts" when I try to search by region in my state or by zip code. have tried on 2 seperate computers and even trying to access through FB page won't work!? ???
I purchased gift certificates for Christopher Seafood and Company for friends but the calls are not being answer and the business has not been open. Whatks up??? Will there be a refund???
Do you know when you are going to restock the coupons for Sakura Steak House?
I only 'liked' this so I could post on wall. PLEASE stop sending me emails! I have requested several times to have them stopped... I just keep getting more! I have been speaking with a CS rep over email and he can't get them to stop coming either. 
Hi, I am just wondering if it is possible to get reimbursed for the certificates I ordered yesterday? My trip has been cancelled and I will no longer need them. 
Emailed about a closed restaurant 2 days ago and haven't gotten a response yet, then called and sat on hold for 20 minutes and gave up :(
when are you goint to stop selling coupons to red tuna fast sushi in greensboro NC. the restaurant has been closed for 2 months... and i have emailed you about this many times?
I keep putting in my codes for two 25.00 credits and it does not show up. I have three all together and only one shows up. It keeps saying code accepted but it is not documenting
Has anyone been happy with restaurants.com? I bought 4 certificates last week for a restaurant in a neighboring town. I found out tonight they've been closed. I emailed restaurants.com. Hope to get and answer and a refund. Pretty upset right now. I feel scamed. Has anyone been happy with this company???
 Recently had 2 restaurants that we went to - sign's posted as of a certian date we no longer take restaurant.com coupons.....so what do we do?? REFUND's???
I just won a giftcard from someone for 25...but I do not know of anywhere around here that takes this. Can you help me?? I live in Fort Payne, Alabama area.
My husband and I went out to dinner this past weekend, expecting to use one of the Restaurant.com gift certificates that we purchased. We were informed that the restaurant no longer accepts them. We PAID for them - the restaurant is still in business. The waitress told us that they felt that enough customers had used them, that they will continue to come in on their own without needing the restaurant.com certificates. Is there a policy on this? We paid for them and now can't use them. Thanks.
On the site it says merchant certificates do not expire but on the print out it says expires 1 year from purchase date. Whih i true?
I summited an email with the restaurant information and cert. # to get rembursed cause the place do longer accepting the cert. How long should i wait before calling you? and if so, what is the 800 # to do so?
There is a restaurant that is listed on the website but does NOT take your certificates any longer. I purchased the certificate earlier in the week and went to the restaurant tonight. Please check with the owners of Galaxy Sports Diner in Escondido, CA............very frustrating!! DO NOT GO THERE!
SO I PICK A RESTAURANT THEN ENTER CODE FROM MY GIFT CERTIFICATE AND WHAT NEXT?
i love this site but recently had a horrible experience at SEASONS AMERICAN CUISINE in Chesterfield. I will never go back. The food was not warm enough or undercooked.I was really hoping this would be a good addition to our neighborhood. It was just nothing to brag about and the staff was just there to say the least. Not very attentive, and a little amature. 
Can't beat these deals. Don't buy them without a discount code, though.
Went to Baltimore Crab & Seafood in Atlanta, GA tonight to use my restaurant.com gift certificate. It is very misleading. It is 2 restaurant in one building. The Baltimore is a small area and the Pearl in the one where you go sit down and eat. The Pearl do not take the gift certificate. They were also out of the $25.00 certificates that were being advertised in todays email. The food was good but the advertising is very misleading. Restaurant.com regular in ATL

Here's to Bluwater Cafe, Newburyport! Great eats!
Bought the certificate for Blue Fish in Irving, TX and when we got there there was a coupon taped to the door and a sign saying that as of 1/15/11 they were no longer accepting the coupon. I asked to speak to a manger who said they would honor it which they did. He said that restaurant .com had not held up their end of the deal. What ever that means, it was not a good first experience, especially since I have 4 more for the same restaurant. 
A restaurant we bought a certificate for just burned down (31 in Gowanda, NY). Am I stuck with a useless certificate or is there something that can be done?
Just got House of Blues $25.00 gift certificate for $2.00!!!!!
Last night we went to a restaurant to use a certificate purchased approx. 3 weeks ago & there was a sign on the door that said 'we no longer accept restaurant.com certificates'. When I went inside and asked, they said they had changed owners approx. 3 MONTHS ago and no longer accept them. This needs to be taken off website, as it's still available for purchase and I've just wasted my money. Makes me reluctant to buy others.
YOU CAN'T BEAT THESE! We stock up on our favorite places when they run this 80% off. $2.00 for $25.00 GC!
Just bought 3 GC for $6.. Nice! Excited to dine out!!! 
Why does the Web site feature "great restaurants such as" with icons on the right side of the screen, yet those restaurants aren't available? I'm referring to the Washington, DC area. I.e. Shula's, Melting Pot, etc.
Not a happy camper. A couple of weeks ago I purchased a gift certificate to use that same evening. Went to the restaurant and it was out of business. Before Christmas purchased 8 gift certificates as Christmas gifts for a local Sushi place. Went there today to use one and was told that the restaurant was no longer going to honor the gift certificates. Feels like bait and switch. I am embarassed now for the people I gave these too. Posted my experience on my wall and people are responding they are having similar issues. Buyer beware.
i'm having problems trying to open certain sections of your website to find restaurants in my area, i keep getting an error message that the window can't be opened and that the operation was aborted. is anyone else having this trouble? 
today i went to t-bone steak house with my husband and kids for the first time and this will be my last time first the waitress sits us down in a corner and just leaves the menu on the corner of the table and walks away and comes to take our order like 10-15 minuts later and brings our food like and hour later and never comes to refill our drinks then she expects 15% comission if your mexican dont go eat there.
Another Question Can you suggest any restuants in NYC where we can get huge Portions! Ideally with food challenges to have some fun !! XX
My husband and I just used for the first time one of the certificates that we had purchased off of your web site. We love getting a discount. Every little bit helps. Just 1 suggestion though, make sure to call the restaurant to make sure they still take the certificate and also ask the server before you order. Other than that no problem in using it. I give you 2 thumbs up!

Thank you for posting the pictures of old Biloxi...My grandma used to work at Mary's...They had the best red beans and rice and po boys in the world...Grandma Canaan could cook too! My father was in the Air Force so we only saw them once a year...Grandpa Canaan would always take us to the seafood factory (Golotts) and there would be mountains of oyster shells and we would eat them raw! I really miss the old Biloxi :)
I've made this cake a couple of times since Thanksgiving and everybody loves it!
Hi, I'm heading to Biloxi this weekend for my blog www.themodernamericans.com and was wondering if there were places that anyone on here would be willing to share/recommend that I should visit. I'm looking for people to share their stories with me and we all know that there are some great stories that come out of the kitchen so I felt like this page and it's users could be really helpful. By the way, I think this facebook page is a great idea. I love cooking and regional recipe variations always inspire me. Thanks!
Hmmm! I'm thinking Oyster and Artchoke soup for dinner
My grandmother made a duff hers was pretty heavy She made a guava Duff since we lived in Key West Fla She put it in a can and sat it in water in the oven Here is a receipe for Guava Duff but it might be whats called duff in your area 3 eggs 1/8 lb of butter 1cup sugar 3 cups flour 2tsp baking powder 1/2 tsps of nut meg Cinnomin and cloves can also be added if you like the taste 2cups of guava plup made by forcing guavas through a seive I think any fruit pulp would work Cream sugar butter add beaten eggs spices and plup sift flour with baking powder and and work into mixture Dough will be stiff Put mixture in a tightly sealed and greased can place in a baking pan and fill with water until the water is 2/3 from top of can let steam 3 hours slice andserve with butter and sugar sauce Her father was from the Bahamas with Englis blood so I figured this is where the recipe came from It"not like pudding at all You may thinking of a trifle
Is this like a bread pudding?
This is the School yeast roll recipe that I was given by a cafeteria worker. I got it either in the late 70's or early 80's. Delicious and easy! It had been converted down by someone in Jackson. 2 pkg. yeast 6 cups unsifted all-purpose flour 1/4 cup warm water 2 tsp. salt 3/4 cup sugar 1 cup cold water 1 cup shortening 2 eggs 1 cup boiling milk Soften yeast in 1/4 cup warm water. Cream sugar and shortening. Add boiling milk, salt, cold water and eggs. Mix well. Add softened yeast. Add flour, 2 cups at a time and beat well with electric mixer. DO NOT KNEAD! Put in large well oiled pan and let rise for 1 hour. Roll dough out half of thickness you want finished roll. Cut with biscuit cutter. Place on greased cookie sheet and let rise for 30 minutes. Bake in 400 degree oven for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown. Pour melted butter over rolls if desired. Makes 3-4 dozen rolls.
Hash Brown Casserole 2 lb. frozen shredded hash browns 2 cans cream of chicken soup 1/2 cup melted oleo 1 pint sour cream 1 tsp. salt 1/2 cup finely chopped onion 1/2 tsp. pepper 10 oz. shredded Cheddar cheese Thaw potatoes and combine all ingredients in large bowl. Mix well. Place in large casserole dish. Bake at 350 degrees for 1-1 1/2 hours. If desired you may top this with two cups crushed corn flakes, drizzled with 1/2 cup melted oleo before baking. This freezes well before baking.
How many rolls does the School Yeast Roll recipe make 
Does anyone remember the baked peanut butter "pie" at Ocean Springs middle school sometime in the 1970's?
Really tasty, easy comfort food. Prep time: 5 minutes. Cook time: 1 hour French Onion Baked Rice 1 cup uncooked rice 1 can beef consomme soup 1 can french onion soup 1/2 stick butter or margarine 1 can or jar sliced mushrooms with liquid Black pepper to taste Melt butter in casserole dish, then add rice, soups, and mushrooms. Stir and cover. Bake at 350 for 30, then remove cover and bake for 30 minutes more, or til rice is done. So simple, and everyone loves it.
Reposting recipe. All of the recipes can be found in our archives under the "Notes" tab at the top of the page. Enjoy!

Sylvan had a blast at the "pickle packle party" at Robert's house. Is there an international contest for how fast one person can eat a jar of your raspberry jam? I want to enter!
I'm sleepy now from last night. You guys really need to stop breaking our stuff!!! :) I'm just kidding! I hope the kinks are worked out for the most part, but we're aware we still have some catching up to do. Many of you didn't get your coupon and we're working on getting all of you what you were promised. THANKS AGAIN FOR ALL YOUR PATIENCE! //Anthony

Piggy arrives in Oklahoma and decides to check out the dry pond...He didn't catch any fish, today. :)
"LIKE" if you're a CHEESE HEAD today! I AM, and not only because it's the only team I can kind of relate to food. :D //Anthony
BAHHHHHHH! Did I scare you? Sorry, that was mean. I was just thinking of how cleverly named "SNACK BOWL" was. It has 2 meanings! Ah man, that's awesome. What are you guys planing for the weekend? //Anthony
Hey! It's ficka-ficka-FANS OF THE wicka-wicka-WEEK! That's some turntable action there...in case you didn't know.

Anyways, this weeks fans are CHRISTIN JOHNSON & BRIAN WEAVER! Shoot me your mailing info to barsfoods.anthony@gmail.com please!

How is Tuesday treating you guys so far? What was for lunch? I did a "splitsville," as I like to call it, with a friend and I'm still stuffed. We split a big ham and turkey sandwich home(office)made in the kitchen here at Bar-S headquarters! Time for a nap! Which will have to wait until AFTER 5pm, of course... :)
Sorry Chi-town! The PACKMEN prevail! I like seeing the good sportsmanship even between rival teams though...That was an ugly win, but a win no less! Who's next, Pittsburgh Pilferers or New York Aircrafts? Bad sports joke, sorry...
Auburn or Oregon tonight. Who takes it? Anyone making any fun snacks for the big college game? //Anthony
"LIKE" this if you enjoyed that football weekend. If not, your team probably lost, so comment and tell us who you want to take it all the way now instead! //Anthony
How many of your are having issues loading SNACK BOWL? I just tried it and it's all working for me...
AND THE WINNERS ARE...Madden Football - DANA MARTIN, George Foreman Grill - MARY LEE, Flag Football Set - FREDERICK WARD, 6 months of Bar-S Product - PHILLIP KOVACH, Grilling Rack - ERIC MCCLELLAN, Panini Press - ALLAN MARTIN Until next week, thank you everyone for playing!
As a reminder, the team w/ the most votes wins the Snack Bowl and the recipe within that team with the most votes wins the grand prize. On the losing team, the recipe with the most votes wins the 2nd place prize. So, it actually only matters how many times your recipe gets rated, and winning is less about the amount of points you have. Want to be sure you win? Ask all your friends and family to vote for yours!
I hope everyone is enjoying the SNACK BOWL! We've got a few weeks left so have fun! Just a quick reminder. To be eligible for the Grand Prizes the top recipes that are being considered will need to be original, user-created recipes. So, with that said, please vote on your favorite recipes to make sure we'll be rewarding those who put the time and effort into making this fun for everyone else! Thank you all again!
Just wanted to drop a quick line to say HELLO! to all the newbies to our fan page. I'm Anthony and I'll be your host FOR-E-VER. Just kidding, just until you guys get sick of me. So, HEY EVERYONE! Thanks for coming by and I hope you have fun here!
I have these great visions of doing MEETUPS in select cities some day just to put names to faces, hang out, munch on some Bar-S concoctions and chillax together! Fun thought for a Friday night! I already feel like we have this awesome community of FB buddies! Lets make it happen soon! //Anthony
This might be the girliest comment you'll ever see from me, but I kinda want Oregon to win simply based on the fact that their helmets and uniform are just AWESOME! Especially the wings on the shoulders... //Anthony
Alright, I was going to make you wait longer but then you guys would just get mad at me. Check in the comments for the winner! Rick Roll please...

It looks like we are having some technical difficulties with the Snack Bowl right now. I get the feeling it's a little tired from so many new people joining in, BUT have no fear, I just finished doing some push ups (3, maybe 4 whole ones) so I'm prepared to beat down this issue! I will let everyone know when it's back up and running. Thanks for your patience everyone! //Anthony

Jennifer Gouldsmith 10 6. Laurie Summerhill 10 7. Ayano Fujii 10 8. Mary Anne Geddes 10 9. Dee Zee 10 10. Brandi Walters Horton 10 
Go to "Info" and follow the link to bar-s.com, fill out the form & print the coupon. I just did. It allowed me to print 2, as usual.
Go to info, click on BarS website, and follow directions, just worked for me.
I just got mine, REALLY this time, not like I posted the last time when I actually got the ones for the bacon. It did indeed allow me to print 2, one ending 1202, the other ending 4402. So I know they're both good.
I received repeated error messages when I tried to access the coupon earlier. Now I don't get an error message, but am still not able to print the coupon because it says "already bought" ! WHAT???!! Please fix this asap. I would really like to be able to print this coupon or have you send me one. thanks
Same problem here- says that I already bought the coupon, but I didn't. Also isn't allowing me to rate the recipes- error message says that the recipes "don't exist." I don't get it!
What do we do to get the coupon? Because I tried it must have gone through but wouldn't show me, it says I have already claimed the offer and didn't. Can you just send me a new link to print it from?
haven't tried your hot dogs yet, but i am a big fan of your awesome customer service response to the coupon issues yesterday. you guys should teach other companies how to run a facebook promotion!
I was just wondering if anyone was having problems uploading recipes? It doesn't do anything when I click submit a recipe. Thanks!
Got a coupon just now. Thank you so much! Love your hot dogs!
Just a heads up, once you purchase the coupons and click the link in your email. If you don't have a printer or your ink is out. Click the little "help" down on the bottom right. There is a snail mail option for the coupon. 
Hey Anthony.. Have all of the prizes from the very first round shipped already? I havent received my Nerf Football yet and am Just curious if I just need to be patient or if I missed it :(
Just want to say that I love that I can get Bar-S foods at the dollar store. 
I just got my coupon! $1 off any Bar-S product. 
I have tried for days to get this coupon and it just keeps spooling. I really want this coupon. Can you make a link that works so we can use your coupon to purchase your weenies please!!!!! Thanks!!!!!!
Bar-S,Will number 1 leader board win anything???? Please let us know???
So bummed. I JUST figured out how to get the coupon (tried last night and gave up) and I see you ran out like moments ago. Oh well, thanks for the opportunity anyway.
You need to sell your turkey hot dogs in the Broken Arrow area! I can't find them in any of the grocery stores here. They sell them in the OKC area! So I do know they exist and they even sell them in upstate NY. So please make them available here in Broken Arrow...my 3 year old daughter loves them!
Bar-S Foods Bar-S, Will number 1 leader board win anything???? Please let us know??? 
How do you know if you win a raffle? It asks for address for prize does that just mean in case you win?
The recipes for the most part are not very original and worthy of votes and winning. Its a popularity contest and nothing more. The entries that are worthy of winning probably won't win because of this. Not fair to entries that really are original and well thought out. Its like when this first started everyone jumped in and wrote anything and then got all their friends to just vote and comment so they could get the first come first serve free stuff based on points given away. They all maxed out within hours the free presses and grills. Now its a raffle based on points to enter. Too bad they had to be so greedy. Leaves a bad taste. Too bad for Bar S because they have a good product and try hard to be fair. But some people have to always take advantage.
You can't go past a good potato salad for your Australia Day BBQ.

Hi SFI team - I LOVE your mag, It has been a lifesaver many times to give me an idea of an interesting meal... Though just a suggestion/request, I know you do a combined December-January issue that mainly covers christmas, but could you possibly add in some Australia Day Meal/snack Ideas in next years issue? Something that will work well in an esky on either a very hot or a very rainy day (can be either extreme in Darwin) - We are hosting our first Australia Day BBQ at out place this year and besides steak, pavlova and lamingtons I'm stuck for Ideas...
The team is back in the office today after a well earned break. We hope you all had a great Christmas and New Year with lots of delicious food!
Head over to the SFI blog and read about what happens when sub-editor Sarah attempts to make a novelty cake for her housemate's birthday.
We've just had a very interesting discussion over lunch about the out-of-date things you find in the back of the cupboard. One SFI staffer found Peppermint essence in her Mum's pantry that ran out of date in 1987! What weird and wonderful things have you found in the back of your cupboard?
The team is moving office this afternoon, just down the hall from where we are, so not too far. There's boxes everywhere here at the moment!
Try out this change on the classic lasagne for dinner tonight!
Don't forget the dip for your Australia Day BBQ tomorrow, this sweet chilli cream cheese dip is simple and delicious, and only has 5 ingredients!

Guess who's visiting my blog today? Kristen of Dine & Dish !! She's SUCH a doll, and is sharing an AMAZING cake recipe!!
Guess what? Someone actually AGREED to guest post on my blog, publicly admitting that they know me!! It's Cheryl, aka TidyMom!! (do you think she knows about the Fruit Roll Up wrappers shoved in my recliner)
Flamin' Hot Cheetos in the afternoon = heartburn at night. When will I ever learn. Sigh.
My favorite perfume EVAH is Pink Sugar. What's yours?
Brownie Sundae Cupcakes, with a twist (hint: they are MAGIC)
Here is an AWESOME shot Angie of I Heart Faces captured of UnMarketing breakin' it down!!
Chicken and Dumplings. Because a girl can't live on sugar alone. 
Chocolate Heart Brownie Bites. So easy, they barely even count.

Went grocery shopping alone and came home with an economy size bottle of wine, 2 boxes of Choco Tacos, a bag of Flamin Hot Cheetos, and 3 boxes of donuts. Someone ground me, for real.
Chocolate Heart Brownies Bites!!
Ooohh, and I want this too!! It even comes with 160 gumballs!! :) (Okay, my husband is not on board with me buying this...sigh...)
I just put the jar of buffalo sauce in the bathroom, and the hairspray in the pantry. Clearly my mind didn't follow me back from New Orleans.
This is the part of the day where I try to buy your love. Just go with it, okay?
Just realized that the Bachelor is on tonight and I'm out of Choco Tacos. This is a big problem.
Oh look....Bloggie Award Nominations are open. Weird, me noticing that. I wonder who will get nominated for Best Food Weblog? 
Made TidyMom's Amazing Pulled Pork for dinner. It is so good, I'm thinking about kissing and marrying it. YUM. 
Currently, there is a cupcake experiment in my oven. Send positive thoughts my way.
Making Chicken and Dumplings today...and I may or may not be documenting the process for a future blog post.
If Chuck Norris's mustache and Tom Selleck's mustache got in a fight, which would win? Why do I even wonder about such things?
My husband came home early today and didn't call first...so when I came out of the bathroom and saw a large man in the hall, he almost go karate chopped in the face and drop kicked. Okay, not really. I screamed and ran.
Two of my favoritest things EVAH, combined!! Cookie Cake Cupcakes. Pretty sure that puts me right up there with Benjamin Franklin when it comes to inventions. 
Please tell me that you follow my soul sister, Shauna from Piece of Cake . If not, you are truly missing out on TONS of laughs and awesome recipes. I. Love. Her. For real.
For those of you who so kindly reminded me, I went back and added a printable recipe to the Blueberry Cookie post. (note to self: no more writing posts while drinking a second glass of wine)

Okay, seriously. This is the birthday gift I was destined to have....Cotton Candy Swirl Cupcake Earrings. Tell my husband, please....I'm afraid that he has stopped listening to me.
Birthday Cake Fudge. SOOOO not a big deal. Okay, maybe it is.

Chocolate Heart Brownie Bites
Here is ourBlissdom flashmob video I found on You Tube...keep in mind that noone else knew, so it wasn't recorded from the complete beginning. And towards the end, Chris Mann Music seems to be the main one being taped (surely not because of his good looks?). We had a BLAST and everyone was so surprised!!

Did anyone get the email for 70 percent off the mquart microwave bags? When I pull that up on the website, it says included in the offer is 32 bags, plus another free 32 bags.....so this would make 64 bags for 70 percent off? I tried calling customer service and no one could answer my question if i was getting 32 or 64 bags for the special price? really want to order now before they sell out? can anyone help??
Re: V3840 I just want to tell you about my food saver; it is fantastic. I swear I use it all the time, I seal everything, I absolutely love it, best investment I made, extremely nice looking, have it on top of my kitchen counter. Even my husband learned how to use it with me. It is definitely worth the money! I would highly recommend it!
I love my foodsaver V3485. As A chef, I use it often....I had to replace mine because it stops sealing from Sams...Now after 4 months, I have to do it again....?????

I am so pleasesd with my new bargain foodsaver which I order from the web. My husband bought 2 bags 5# bags of red potatoes @ $1.00,I cut them in chunks with skins on and roasted them, then put in the freeze/steam bags. I now have 8 bags for a .25 each.
I bought a 3460 last night and this am, I was having difficulties getting the vacuum to work on it. I called the 800 number and spoke to April and she very politely lead me through what I was doing wrong...yes, ME not the machine! I just wanted everyone to know how much I love my new toy (I even resealed everything that was in the freezer..lol) and how wonderful the customer service was that I received! Thanks again April for your assistance!
Not sure if like it or not yet, because I can't figure the thing out. I bought the V3020 plus starter kit. It has 2 gray plastic pieces that were in a small bag that I cannot figure out where they go (nothing in the manual shows what they are or where they belong). Also the sealing strip came out, and as I tried to put it back in I realize that it longer than the area it is suppose to fit in. Can anyone help me figure it out. 
We love our V2480, but why can't we buy replacement foam seals? I've looked all over your site and the internet. Am I just missing a link to "replacement parts" ? We don't want to have to spend $100 plus on a new machine just because a foam seal has worn out. 
I bought a 3460 this weekend and loved it so much that I bought a mini for our daughter who is in college. Kohl's had it on sale for $29.00 and I had a 30% off coupon..don't know who was the most excited..me or her! 
I did the roasting of an extra bag of potatoes I had laying around, now do you think I should put them in the steamer bags or regular??? 
Another question please: explain how the jar sealer works???? thinking of buying one. Thanks
Can you tell me when will the item # V3860 FoodSaver Home Chef Vacuum Sealing Gift Set be back in stock? Which one of the sealer would you say is the best one?
i have aV2440 with starter kit..it never has sealed a bag properly the heat strip has 3 lumps in the cover over the heat strip.ive called 4 times in the 18 months since i bought this. and all they say is smooth it out with your finger it will be ok.well it's not and when i called today they say sorry.BUT WE WILL BE GLAD TO SELL YOU ANOTHER.your warranty has run out..they never not one time said SEND IT BACK...no way sunbeam-foodsaver-jarden corp SHAME ON YOU.

Can you tell me when will the item # V3860 FoodSaver Home Chef Vacuum Sealing Gift Set be back in stock? Which one of the sealer would you say is the best one?
We recently used our foodsaver for our treasured photos and keepsakes. We vacuum sealed them before placing them in the cedar chest, you never know when a toddler is going to attack with a cup of juice :) 
I received a V3460 for Christmas this year (2010). I thought that I would be able to seal potato chip bags and cereal bags etc. Every time I try the bag will not seal and isn't even held down by the bag sensor. Is there something I can do to fix this. I would like to be able to seal chips because we take a little while to eat them. Thanks
Hey Fans - Today is the last day to get a FREE Vacuum Sealer with the purchase of our FoodSaver Starter Kit. Total retail value: $119.98. You pay: $39.99. Click on the link below to take advantage of this limited-time offer!
He I bought about $150.00 of canisters and jar sealers, and paid shipping, everything I bought we saw at Fleet farm for cheaper and NO SHIPPING, you would think directly from the company it would have been cheaper... Learned my lesson. 
I used my jar sealer for the 1st time, worked like a charm, I put all my sugars in them and nuts, love my new foodsaver. 
FoodSaver fans...buyers beware when ordering from the FoodSaver/Jarden website! They will screw up your order and tell you there is nothing they can do to fix it until the shipment is delivered. You will have to wait and call back in a couple of days to see if was delivered to a wrong address. Then they will see if they can reissue your order. What a nightmare! I really wish there was a dislike button and wall!!!
Can anyone tell me which model replaces the Professional II.After years of use mine just stopped working and I cant find that model anywhere.I guess it has been updated or discontinued. Any help is greatly appreciated .

The Lunchables commercial with the little girl walking a zillion dogs and then putting on her skates while they drag her along is so TOTALLY irresponsible! A child that age should be supervised while walking ONE dog, not allowed to walk half a dozen on her own. In real life all it would take is one squirrel to set the whole pack running while dragging her behind. And I don't even want to think about what could happen to her while being pulled behind a pack of excited dogs while she is on skates! What a really good way to give kids a REALLY bad idea! Especially when one of your Health and Well-Being goals is to Advertise responsibly to children! This commercial should be pulled immediately!

It's been a while since we had Mac and Cheese. We mean, a couple years. But after hearing about Ted Williams, we had to go out and buy "Kraft." Haven't heard the radio commercial yet, and, however, hope to see it on TV.. We are talking about buying more Kraft Mac & Cheese, to donate to food shelters and religious places.. It would be a good positive message to those who must eat from Food shelters. Now, Kraft Mac & Cheese may very well represent, bettering ones life, making positive changes.. We really hope this is the beginning of a beautiful campaign. Well done Kraft, and, Ted Williams - You guys are great !!
Chill that Chocolate: Hot chocolates great when its cold outside, but not when your beloved bar melts in the sun. Thats why we've 25,000 refrigerated Cadbury Coolers in Indian storesand were researching special packaging that will help prevent it melting too. Have you got any hot ideas on keeping your chocolate cool?
For Kraft Foods in Japan, the New Year brings a new name, Nihon Kraft Foods, along with a new website and a whole new look! To mark the change the team redecorated the office in delicious colors. Have you redecorated anything in your life for the New Year? Wed love to hear about it!
What is the chance that Kraft will bring the "Cherry Ripe" candy bar to the U.S.?
I think it is time for Kraft to address the fraud and poor management at Tassimo Direct before it tarnishes your reputation. Google is chock full of sites regarding this. Simple Google "Tassimo Direct fraud" to see... not a pretty picture. We have been subjected to such as well, and it has proven to be a nightmare for us, beginning with a Tassimo product arriving at our doorstep, charged fraudulently to our credit card. We never ordered nor wanted such. No corrective measures have been taken by Tassimo. Please take some responsibility on this. regards Madison Spencer

Where do we go to (a) complain about the new flavor of Catalina Dressing, (b) get something that actually tastes like the original Catalina Dressing, and (c) get my money back on the bottle of the "new" flavor that's never going to be used? 
Simply A-Maze-Ing: Volunteers from CADBURY UK spent a day renovating a community space as part of a series of team challenges across the country for Groundwork UK.

I use so many of your Products from Mac-N-Chesse, to Oreos, and the Most French Vanilla Cafe. Do you have any Coupons to share for any of your Products? I have not seen any coupons anywhere.
What do I reach for for dinnertime when the East Coast is being pummeled by a snow storm? Kraft Macaroni and Cheese baby! There's nothing else like it on a cold winter night. Thanks, Kraft people!
I have been eating kraft mayo for years and love the smoth creamy taste, but here lately its been tasting different, and thats not good, I've checked the dates on it and everything I can thinks of and in conclution I think they have changed the way they make it, if so STOP IT!! put it back it was great the way it was. PLEASE FIX IT
Hi, a while back my local grocery store used to carry Kraft Gourmet Dips & Dressings it was in a small 255ml bottle. The one day around summer of 2009 they disappeared and I haven't seen them anywhere since. Was the product discontinued?... or is it merely my hometown that has stopped carrying it.
Key to Ending Hunger: Fixing agriculture and, in turn, banishing hunger and malnutrition is clearly possible. It is a matter of focus, prioritisation, political will and collective action. said our CEO. Irene, in todays Mumbai, Economic Times. Agree? Do you think about the story behind your food? 
Book Worm: Do we need to keep reinventing ourselves? Premal Spiegel (meet her on the Our Team tab) recommends: The Mirror Test by Jeffrey Hayzlett. Having seen Jeffrey at a conference, his outspoken approach made me want to read his book. He talks about how companies have never been in a better position to be successful.
Isn't it ironic that 70% of the world's hungry people work in agriculture? It's a big, complex problem today, so what will we do in 2050 with a world population of 9 billion? Here's a start: A New Vision for Agriculture unveiled this week at the World Economic Forum. How do you think we can turn vision into action?
Youve Done It! You joined the virtual huddle, texted, Facebooked, YouTubed and tweeted all to help us give over 20 million meals to Feeding America as part of our Huddle to Fight Hunger campaign: http://on.fb.me/hWKVVX Thank you and congratulations!
World Food Programme shared this good reminder: Remember that old adage about giving a man a fish? Better to teach him to fish, right? Well, sort of. In real life, helping the kinds of people that need fish is a little more complicated than that. Heres why...
Last Thursday, we asked you to complete this sentence: "If we all ______, we could stop hunger." You gave us some great answers and weve put them in a word cloud to share.. With the World Economic Forum in full swing what would you say to world leaders about hunger if you had the chance?

ES IST VOLLBRACHT!Ich will mal so beginnen: "Du bist keine Schnheit, vor Arbeit ganz grau! Liebst dich ohne Schminke; bist 'ne ehrliche Haut; leider total verbaut, aber gerade das macht dich aus!" BOCHUM ist die Stadt, in der wir im April ein neues MONGOS RESTAURANT aufmachen werden. Wie findet Ihr das ? Weitere Informationen folgen.....
Etwas spt, aber ich wollte mich nochmal fr das fantastische Sylvesteressen in Kln bedanken. Wir waren zu viert, das erste Mal mit meinen Eltern;die waren sehr skeptisch. Als wir das Restaurant nach gut 4std futtern verlieen, waren sie nicht nur begeistert, sondern haben mir das Versprechen abgenommen dass wir jetzt immer ins Mongos gehen mssen, wenn sie mich besuchen. Was ich immer wieder toll finde (abesehen von der Curry-Mango-Marinade): den Service. Ich bin selbst "vom Fach" und schnell kritisch, aber hier ists immer wieder toll: alle sind super geschult was das Essensangebot betrifft, wissen Bescheid wenn man Fragen hat, und vor allem werden Serviceregeln eingehalten, zb in welcher reihenfolge die gste am tisch bedient werden etc.- von der freundlichkeit mal ganz abgesehen. Nie hat man das Gefhl, das Personal ist nur freundlich, weil es das sein muss! Das Highlight an Sylvester (neben dem Rehrcken): der Nebentisch bekam schon Kaffee, als wir noch beim Hauptgang waren. Zum Kaffee gab es statt Keks nun kleines Stck Brownie. Meine Mam sah dies und meinte leise und wirklich nur zu uns, das sei ja toll, da wrde sie sich jetzt schon auf den Kaffee freuen. Keine 5 Minuten spter stand die Kellnerin die den Kaffee gebracht hatte, mit einem Unterteller an unserem Tisch- auf dem Unterteller lagen 4 Stckchen Brownie. Wir bruchten nicht bis zum Kaffee warten, meinte sie mit einem Augenzwinkern. DAS nenne ich perfekten, aufmerksamen Service- ein Grund mehr, regelmig das Mongos zu besuchen ubd warum Kln fr uns das "one and only" ist! Danke fr diesen fantastischen Abend!
wenn wir in mnster nicht schon so nen grossartigen laden htten,wrde ich laut nach einem schreien.1a food(ich sterbe fr kokossuppe),super team und tolles ambiente. wenn ihr mich fragt gehrt bochum noch erobert. die kleinen,feinen stdte sind doch viel interessanter als zum beispiel berlin,wo es alles im berfluss gibt.

Came up with an Amazing Nacho Cheese Dip last night with Daiya! Here is how I did it if anyone is interested: I took a sauce pan then put some Earth Balance Vegan Butter (about 2 Tbls) in and got it good and melted. Then I cut up some jarred Jalapeo peppers and put them in the butter, along with about 1/8th cup of the juice in the jar. Once the peppers had been sweated in the butter and juice for about 5 minutes, I add about 3 Tblps of flour to make a rue (continuously stirring with a wire wisk while adding in the flour). Then once the flour has soaked up the butter and Jalapeo juice, I add unsweetened soy milk, until it is a saucy consistency (continuously stirring with a wire wisk while adding in the soy milk). Then for the cheese! To make Nacho I use 1/2 bag of both Cheddar and Mozzarella Daiya Vegan Cheese. Once it is all melted, I finish it off with adding just a little more of the Jalapeo juice while mixing it all until the texture was perfect. That's it... You now have homemade Vegan Nacho Cheese Dip!
This little Italian place by me has gluten free food but no safe cheese. I brought in my Daiya and they made me cheesy breadsticks and made my pasta all fancy with the daiya. So happy when people are able to make accommodations like this.
Daiya in Jerusalem/Al Quds. As you can see we were cheap on the cheese since we only got 4 packs all the way from the U.S of A. So when you coming over here?
Amazing vegan/gluten-free pizza from Gourmet Pizza Company in Tampa, FL!
Quinoa is called "the gold of the Incas" for good reason; a complete protein, it contains 9 essential amino acids, iron, calcium, fiber, and is gluten-free! We love this grain for its' nutty flavor, crunchy texture, and versatility (great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Quinoa stuffed portobellos and peppers topped with Daiya Mozz is an awesome way to grain-entertain! Is quinoa apart of your daily diet? 
Oregon: There are 6 Papa's Pizza Parlor's cooking with Daiya! Locations are also available on our website www.daiyafoods.com

I can't believe how good this cheese is..my first time was this week at a restaurant and I don't know one carnivore who would have been able to tell the difference. Wow!
this vegan cheese is saving my life. i had the BEST chicago style pizza stuffed with daiya vegan cheese and it was absolutely delicious. i am very pleased that this cheese is catching on to all the vegan and vegan friendly restaurants. it doesn't just knock other vegan cheeses out. it smashes them and then tosses them into the sun where they won't melt properly and have a poor aftertaste. 
I just wanted to say thank you for putting a great quality product out there. It's such a great thing to be able to eat simple things like pizza and garlic cheese bread *with* my dairy allergic child. A vegan cheese that melts and stretches, who knew?! Now I just need to have a chat with our local whole food stores to get them to carry it local to me (in Halifax, NS).
I just bought some today at Whole Foods. I topped my sons spaghetti with some and it was yummy! I can't wait to make him a gluten free pizza with it!!! Thank you for making such a great product :)
This is by far THE best completely vegan, soy, and gluten free cheese! Thank you for putting some excitement back into my meals!
7 minutes til my first gluten-free pizza with Daiya mozzarella. Daiya, THANK YOU for bringing cheese back into my life!
My family LOVES your cheese and it melts. Thank you. :-).
You have the best cheese!!!!
Has Daiya ever changed the recipe? I tried the Mozzarella style when it first came out and didn't like it. Recently bought the cheddar style shreds and love it. ???
I became vegan last year and I'm trying to get my 5 year old into the action. Tonight I made vegan mac and cheese with a white sauce made with earth's balance, corn starch and soy milk and then stirred in some daiya cheese. When I gave it to him he said Wow! and took one bite and said Yum! 
we made cheesy chili muffins using daiya this weekend - my 5 year old couldn't get enough - can y'all put up a recipes tab on fb where we can post and share recipes? 
i made pasta with the cheddar and mozzarella flavors last night . blew. my mind!!!!!
Just saw the dairy-free Mac & cheese by Amy's! So happy to see more and more daiya at my grocer. Thank you!
Just tried this vegan cheese on Tuesday. The best vegan cheese ever!
I absolutely love this cheese and could find it easily in the US. Now, I'm in South Africa. Does it exist here?
THIS IS THE BEST CHEESE ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3
Bought my very first Daiya vegan cheese tonight!! I am so excited!!!
For months I have been excited about trying Daiya shredded style. I made some pizza at home & it looked so good! But when I tried it, it seemed mushy, had a weird smell, & unpleasant aftertaste. Possibly I just got a "bad batch" from my Co-Op? Did I cook it wrong? I'm sad :-(
Do you guys have any coupons out there? I've been trying to find some kosher non-dairy cheese for a while and would like to try it before I buy it at full price.
Over the weekend, my husband surprised me by buying some cheddar Daiya and making mac & cheese for dinner. It was AMAZING--even better than I remember mac & cheese tasting! Thank you for making such an awesome product!
My favorite thing to do with Daiya is toss a quarter of a cup into my preheated cast iron skillet and let it brown on both sides: Instant cheese chip ... Delish!
I really wish Daiya would make a pepper jack. That would made my vegan life complete. :) Love your products. 
Want to try your cheese, and right now can't get to Portland, ME to get it...do you have anything closer in Maine? I certainly would buy some to ship on line..want to be a devoted customer or a sales rep, which ever comes first...hehe...can you give me a lead or imput? Thank you! 
I've just discovered your super delicious dairy-free cheese!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YYYYummyyyyyy! 
thank you for this cheese! lol my 18 month old daughter is allergic to dairy, soy, eggs and peanuts. ive researched for months trying to find a cheese she can eat. youre vegan shredded cheese is the only one I could find, last week she had a cheese quesidilla for the first time and LOVED it! thank you! :)
I am so happy I found your cheese!!! I have never found a cheese worthy of my vegan gluten free pizza until today. Thanks!!!!
Celebrated my 38th birthday with a vegan pizza at Amicis in downtown San Jose!! Thank You!!!
OK- I'm addicted to your cheese! Question: Have you ever considered adding some calcium and/or protein to it?
This is by far the best vegan cheese I have EVER eaten!! I just had the tastiest grilled vegan cheese in the world this morning. I'm so glad I tried it. :)
Available in Cobourg, Port Hope or even Peterborough, Ontario?
<3 I just wanted to say that I am not lactose intolerant, and I love regular cheese. ....But man, your fake cheese beats REAL cheese in most recipes... Thank you for being so wonderful!
Im a blogger who would love to review your products for my blog, Please message me back & let me know who from your company i would discuss more about setting this up with. I would love to work with you guys and do a review for you! - Simi -
Best vegan "cheese" EVER!! LOVE! <3<3
So, for the Pepperjack (so exciting!)- will it be in shreds, or in a block?
Just had my first Daiya Mac-n-Cheese. I don't even know what to say. I thought it would be good but had no idea it would so outrageously delicious. WOW! I've now tried it on pizza, with vegan tacos and in quesadillas. Can't wait to try the Pepper Jack when it comes out. Thanks for making such an awesome product! Can't wait to try it out on all my dairy loving friends. 
Daiya Cheddar on my own Vegan Chili Recipe
your mozzarella cheese is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!!! vegan pizza with veggies and homemade vegan sausage.
 YEA! finally got a local store to carry DIAYA so I dont have to travel to my co op ( where it is cheaper and I do tend to stock up when I go there ) there also carrying tofurkey pizza with DIAYA cheese and its selling well there not charging out ragous prices either I plan to make diaya MAC N CHEEZE today or tomorrow
where can i purchase daiya block chedder cheese?
May I offer a suggestion to daiya cheese? Would you be able to make the plastic bags with zip lock tops? 
We're having a huge 2 year old birthday party and making it all vegan with kids making their own mini pizzas with daiya vegan cheese! Yummmm!
I'm soooo excited, found Daiya cheese today in Sudbury, Ontario. No more 4 hour drives for me to stock up :) !!!!!!
Dear Daiya, my wife made pizza rolls yesterday that were safe for everyone in our family to eat! (dairy, egg, soy, nut allergies) They were awesome in part to her using Daiya in the recipe. Thanks!!
Oh my full belly! I just had nachos for lunch. Thank you for making that possible!
Dear Daiya - Our 4 1/2 year old would really, really love if you'd offer a vegan version of Cheetos. Tings just don't taste the same. Tings are good, but not really an alternative to Cheetos. So, we're hoping Daiya will make some sort of Daiya snack which are comparable to Cheetos. Pretty please with vegan cheese on top??? :)
A sure sign that spring is on the (not too distant) horizon . . . the seeds are here! Three racks of the stuff gardeners dreams are made of. 
Heard the rumor that Sunfood is now owned by Monsanto? Or that Sunfood has been buying cooked Ecuadorian cacao powder and selling it as raw? I checked into these rumors and they seem to be false. I will post details in the comment section below.
Ever heard that all imported young green coconuts are dipped in formaldehyde? Theyre not! If it does happen, it is extremely (extremely, extremely) rare and to the best of my knowledge there is no proof that it has happened at all. (If you have proof, I would love to see it though.) Most young green coconuts are dipped in bleach to keep them from molding, but the ones we carry in are not even dipped in bleach. 
Garlic Jims is here sampling gluten-free pizza right now. They will be here until all the pizzas are gone. New flavors too!
GLUTEN-FREE? Garlic Jims will be sampling their delicious gluten-free pizza here tomorrow from 11:00 AM until all the pizza is gone. This is the best gluten-free pizza we have tried. Ever. Really. Come taste for yourself!
Leahs Gluten-Free Bakery is here today selling freshly baked breads and treats. They area a dedicated gluten, dairy and soy-free facility and use Misty Meadows eggs, Dagoba baking chocolate, organic nuts ordered through Terra Organica, organic sweeteners from Wholesome Sweeteners, and gluten-free flours from Bobs Red Mill. Located in the entryway to the Public Market today and every Wednesday from now on.
Just wanted to say ... LOVE your gourmet raw food section!!! It is the best I've seen anywhere! :oD Thanks for having so many lovely things to eat. I ADORE your store! <3

Does WinCo carry goat meat?
I just got back from Winco in Reno NV, since they have renovated the prices are climbing...I didn't ask for a new and improved store just reasonable prices...it is almost the point that I will have to start shopping around...Winco will no longer get ALL of my money..
How can I find out what your (weekly) specials and sales are? I must not be close enough to get the flyer in the mail.
Winco is the happiest place on Earth.... =]
New week and our love/hate relationship with Mondays continues. Beat that nasty "Case of the Mondays" with a delicious cup of coffee from the many roasts available at your local bulk foods department!
Local newspaper showed a new store for Glendale/Peoria, AZ , when will the store open?
im just curious, reading everyones posts and knowing how long Winco has been around why isnt Winco a "big name" like ralphs and albertsons and costco and so on and why hasnt it expanded as much as those competitors? everyone wants a winco in or near where they live so it is obviously demanded. just curious since i never heard a word about in untill i moved last year and it is such a great store.
Would love to have a Winco at the south end of Nampa, Idaho. There's a large parcel of land for sale at Hwy 45 and Lewis Lane if you need a site suggestion!
Another suggestion for you-putting on in Ontario, Oregon! The town itself isn't that large but there are a lot of outlying communities (Fruitland, Payette, Nyssa, Parma, Weiser, New Plymouth, Vale) that would shop there!
I wish there was a winco closer to me on the south side of nampa as well!! I just got hired at the boise winco warehouse and would like to shop there exclusively. Shopping at the nampa store is chaos!!! Hook it up winco!!!!! :) Thanks, Danny
Just discovered in Kent, WA.Wow, such good prices and selection! Love it!
winco of olympia washington rocks....haha met some nice folks there today even a poor gal on crutches lol...;-)
When will the Tacoma Winco start taking applications? I'm interested in that store and it's just about a mile from my house.
Will you be posting an announcement for when your new tacoma branch will be up and hiring?
We need WinCo in the O.C.!!!!! My family just stopped by the Pomona store on our way home from a road trip and we all fell in love. The kids loved picking out a treat from the bulk bins and my husband and I loved that our grocery dollars were stretched further without giving up quality! PLEASE come to O.C. so that we can also save our hard earned money! (I also love that you don't take credit cards. It's very Dave Ramsey of you!)
I love your store! I drive about 40 miles (one way) just to shop there. I live in Tremonton, Utah and only have 2 grocery stores here in town and they are so high price it is insulting!!! I wish you would come and teach these stores in this town a lesson on service!!! 
Will there be a WinCo in Bellingham, Wa anytime soon. Thought at onetime there was.
Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee Come to Orange County Ca....we neeeeeed you!!
Ok guys looks like you are building in Tacoma, WA. It's not Lakewood but I will take it. Do you know when it will be opening?? I have told everyone I know. Let me know if you need a PR person in this neck of the woods.
Kudos to the bakery department! The bagels are awesome and so reasonably priced and my family HAS to have your cinnamon/raisin/walnut toast several times a week for breakfast with scrambled eggs. I make all my own sweets, so I haven't tried your cakes or cookies, but they sure do look good!
Made the 60+ mile drive to your New Lacey Wa store tonight, love it. One issue in the entire store for me. The huge section in the corner with all of the fresh mushrooms, etc there is no scale located in that particular section. I talked to someone there about it and they said new store and they agree, they'll take care of it. But what a great store. I love WinCo I always buy like 3-5 lbs of fresh mushrooms, and their always in stock, other stores are out over 50% of the time.
I work at store 59 in Fresno... And I have no complaints!!! I love the store! love the managers! love the employees! love the customers!!! I hope all the Winco's are as perfessional and have a great positive attitude as our store!!! That store is awsome!!! Way to go Ryan, Vicky, Bo and all the hard working employees for making such a great team!!! :-)
At the Orem store, there is no "bring your own bags and get 5 cents credit" policy like there was when I shopped in Clackamas and Tigard stores years ago. Is that gone now or just applicable in some places? I sure wish it was the policy in Orem!
love the selection and prices. On our first visit to the Lacey store my husband and I were like two kids in a candy store. Our usual store for shopping has been FM, but after shopping at your store there is no comparing. Can't say enough! Thank you for coming to Lacey!
I'm trying to find the nutrition values of the Browned Turkey you had on sale this weekend. Where would I find it? (WeightWatchers is NO help on trying to figure out how many points it is)
went to Winco today and stumbled upon your natural ground turkey. Such a great deal and so yummy. I made taco salads with it tonight. Thanks for the wonderful savings on health food :)
I have heard rumors that you are planning a Winco for Lehi, Utah. Please tell me that's correct!
I went to the WinCo in Sumner WA; I believe it was the one in Sumner, and tried getting one of WinCos very delicious pizzas. But after five minutes of looking for it, a lady told us the new stores are not putting in a pizza sale thing. My question is why? Does it not make enough money? Do not many people buy pizzas? Although Costco makes the biggest (18 for $10.??) WinCo makes the tastiest. Not to mention it makes the front of the store smell good. ^_^
Love the bulk section! Yesterday I bought 37 cents worth of cumin and refilled 2 spice jars!
WinCo Foods is proud to announce that http://bolthouse.com/ carrots and juices are now being featured at all of our stores. Visit your local produce section today and taste "the sweetest, most delicious, 'tender-crunchy' carrots" or enjoy a sip of "100% healthy, 100% natural and 100% delicious" juice!
Any more stores planned for Western Washington? Thanks!
I had a really bad experience tonight at the SUMNER, WA store. I would like to speak with someone regarding the treatment I received while shopping there. To sum it up, I was treated like a second class customer for trying to use COUPONS! I reviewed your corporate coupon policy and was well within the guidelines, but was told otherwise and walked out feeling very disrespected.
I hear a WinCo is opening in Tacoma WA!!! Yay! Any idea when it will be hiring/opening? I have someone near & dear to me that has an extensive grocery background that needs a Job?
Thanks so much again for the Bob's Blue Cheese Dressing! It sounds silly but if you only knew how much easier you have made my life!!! I <3 my WinCo!!! You guys are the best!!
Is there ANY way of finding out what items are on sale at WinCo besides heading to the store and walking up and down the ailse? I'm a big planner so I really prefer to know ahead of time what I'm looking for on sale. :) Even if it's just an online preview or something, it would help.
I understand you are opening stores in Arizona. Do you have any information as to when you will begin hiring and how to go about applying for jobs? Thank you.
What is the brand of the dark bulk chocolate?
I have a bulk food question. Does WinCo sell dry Cannellini beans in bulk? These are also known as Fagioli or white kidney beans. I shop the West Hillsboro store.
Can you guys please tell your Stockton, CA store to actually fix their chillers/freezers? Ive bought WARM frozen pot pies, and found meat rotted on several occasions (espically ground beef). That combined with rancid milk, and I am seriously looking at walmart instead -Concerned Customer for 4+ yrs.
We just got a WinCo in Lacey WA...I'm rooting for Yelm WA!!!! We need another large grocery store to keep Safeway and WalMart in check! YAY!
So glad WinCo came to Tracy, CA. Love the store and the employees are so helpful. Loving the great prices. Thanks ;)

I sure wish Winco would come to Keizer, Oregon!! I know there are two stores in Salem, but it takes a lot of time/gas to get to these stores. Well worth it for me, but would be nice for the residents of Keizer, who are at the mercy of Fred Meyer, Safeway and Grossly over-priced Roth's.

So, did all of you move to Boise, or did they just change the FB team?

Wondering when the tacoma washington store will be opening? 
HELLO WINCO.....Quick question regarding donations.......RELAY FOR LIFE is an event held every year to raise money for the American Cancer Society. How do I go about asking Winco to sponser my team, which is Team Mariah.......
Is there somewhere I can go to find a current listing of the bulk food items (and preferably their prices) that are in stock? I drive an hour to get to WinCo and a item/price list would be helpful as I plan my meals, menus and shopping lists. Thanks.
Do you have a couple free minutes? Please fill out this quick survey for our friend Jordan L., it'll help a ton on her school project. Thank you! 1. How often do you shop at WinCo? 2. How did you hear about WinCo? 3. What do you think WinCo can Improve on? 4. Do you use online Savings coupons?

Those lovers of fine food stock and sell our beef at selected stores. Just in case you ever want to go all 'GBK' in your own kitchen. Posh.
18,thats how many ingredients go into our BBQ sauce. Not because its written on the back of a container, but because thats what the recipe card says. Yep, were still hand-making these wonderful sauces in each of our kitchens - chopping, cooking and pouring over each step like a crazed alchemist from a J.K. Rowling storyline. And that good friends, is one of the reasons why our burgers are still the business.

Wed love to raise 100K, and thats a lotta fine eating, so if youve got friends who live in caves and hath no clue about this wonderful promo, get them involved! Lunch anyone?

Happy National Peanut Butter Day! Do you like your PB&J sandwich with crunchy or smooth peanut butter?
January is National Soup Month! We're celebrating with a hot bowl of tomato soup and a grilled cheese (on Roman Meal bread, of course). What's your favorite soup and sandwich combo?
Can I get Roman Meal Bread in Michigan anymore? Grand Rapids Area? Haven't seen it in forever !
Im eating your delicious bread rite now! :D yummm whole grains Lol
Which stores carry Roman Meal in the Seattle / Bellevue area? It was Safeway for a while but my local stores (Redmond / Woodinville / Kirkland) don't seem to stock it any more.
What ever happened to Roman Meal waffles??? They were my FAVORITE!!
I bought your bread the yesterday, just has a good draw to it :D I've enjoyed an extravagant 6 am before bed sandwich and a heaping pb&j sandwich for the following 12pm breakfast... i believe we're gonna have lots more days together Roman Meal! Big love to ya!
Had a coupon so decided to try this bread for the first time. We all loved it! With a family of six it didn't take long to go through the whole loaf! I was surprised all my kids ate it so I will be buying frequently!
I eat about two loaves of bread a week, as I'm an admitted turkey sandwich addict. I only eat Roman Meal Honey Wheat Berry, as I absolutely love the bread. With that being said, I was disappointed today when I bought two new loaves only to find out that their is an obvious difference in size for each slice of bread. It looks like 25% of the slices have been removed. What gives? My sandwiches are now about 75% of the size that they used to be. The package states that it contains the exact same amount of bread as the old packages, but they are not the same. I'm a very fit person, and although I'm sure the loss of 1/4 of my pieces of bread will not affect me physically, I would just like to have an explanation as to what happened. Did you change bread forms? I love this bread to death, just wanting to know what the deal is. Signed, Turkey Sandwich Connoisseur
Has Roman Meal stopped making waffles? They were delicious!! Also, where can I find Roman Meal bread in the Boston area? Thanks!
hey, when is the release date in cinemas for australia? ps. can't wait for this movie!

One of the best movies ever. I have no shame in saying that tears were in my eyes by the end of the movie. Such an amazing film. Great job guys!
Awesome movie!! Has a lot of hidden messages about life
Just saw the movie and wonderful movie. Tim Mc Graw and Gwyneth Paltrow gave great performances. However Garrett Hellund's singing voice is fantastic. I hope to see more music from him in the future. The storyline was wonderful and touched my heart. 
Just got home from seeing "Country Strong" and I am SPEECHLESS. My Mom and I played the sound track on the way there and on the way home because we just couldn't get enough. Excellent job to all the actors/actresses and everyone that made this movie possible! This deserves an OSCAR! - "And that's how it's done sweetheart." 
Just saw Country Strong! Loved, loved it. So sad though.... :(
Wow,Country Strong was just phenominal such a great cast and movie.
Just seen country strong.great movie and cast and their voices too and soundtrack.
I just saw the movie tonight and I am so full of emotions! Such an excellent movie! The music is awesome... can't wait to get the soundtrack! And Gwenyth did such an amazing job acting ~ she deserves an award! I can't wait to go see it again!!! <3 <3
Saw Country Strong today and one word comes to mind AWSOMENESS! loved it so much counting the days till I can buy it on video made me cry, smile and sing loved all the songs had to get the CD thank goodness it was out already and I didnt have to wait but pls do offer for download the song by Leighton Meester feat. Garrett Hedlund - Give In To Me faith is good on the cd but you cant fake the feeling they give me when I hear them sing it!!
It sucks that its not playing in my city (Lawton Ok) but its ok it gives me a reason to take my wife to a dinner/movie date in Wichita Falls Tx on our day off
Just seen Country Strong. Paltrow blows it away.... In fact everyone did an awesome job and I love the music. Best movie since the Note Book!!!! LOVED IT will definatly own it when it's available. Will have the sound track as well!
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! Amazing story line, and just brilliant. 
Just got back from this movie here in Dallas, TX. Loved it. Best wishes with opening weekend! :)
Absolutely loved it. I've been listening to the soundtrack since oct so I found myself singing the words to all the songs. It was great! But am I the only one who didn't expect the ending?! Didn't really like that part.
Howdy, I'm an Iowa cowboy and I just went and saw Country Stong with my mama, last night. I tell you what, it's been a long time since I've seen a movie that could make me excited and sad at the same time! It was a great movie, and I highly recommend it for all of the country people out there just like me! Go see it! It was awesome!
Country Strong is FABULOUS!!! I hope it wins all of the awards! Gwyneth never ceases to amaze me! She nails it in this film! Not to mention all of the other talent! I can't wait to see it again! Ginna from Atlanta 
LOVE LOVE LOVED THIS MOVIE. SURPRISED ME AND I am never surprised at the plot i usually figure it all out. sountrack was great and loved the new guy he made that movie for me. I didn't even read credits so I didn't get his name. great job will own it.
It was an aftermath of an accident... we didnt get to see why she was in rehab or the whole thing with baby they just gave brief explanations... there should have been like a one yr ago piece where she falls of the stage or she was drinking or something for background information on the aftermath 
Wow this movie was really really REALLY amazing! It's just 1 of those movies where u wouldn't expect much of , but in the end you find that it was something beautiful. Every1 did an amazing job. Leighton Meester did amazing in her acting...as 4 Gwyneth Paltrow.. she had incredible vocals that just needed 2 b heard. Tim McGraw ( My future husband lol ) was very amazing himself and very inspirational throughout the movie and never gave up on his wife. The soundtrack was beautiful, overall my fav movie so far as of 2011. I recommend ppl watch this movie. I would watch it over and over again. There def was a lot of 'OMG' moments. In the end we shall all learn from this beautiful quote , "It doesn't matter where you've been as long as you come back strong." God Bless
Went to see the movie last night on our date night....WOW, We loved it, the music is great....love me some Garrett Hedlund!! His blue eyes are nearly as hot as my hubby's! 
Just Saw it was great would see it again
Just saw Movie~~I loved It~~~I fell In Love With Beau<3
amazing!! saw it today :) kinda sad, not expecting it to end the way it did... :/
I am totally in love with the song Kelley helped Beau with at the beginning of the movie (lyrics: you ran out of the rain into the building you held the door open...). Where can I find it? I have bought both CD's and it's not there. I love the Movie and so did my brother. 
Awesome movie very heartfelt I loved it! :)
I loved Country Strong. One part was not in line with what I felt was a Country Strong person but she proved that you can come back and be strong. The music was great and the message was awesome. The chemistry between Beau and the stars was unforgettable. Tim McGraw did an awesome job of an ambitious husband with no scruples or morals. Its sad to find love in all the wrong places but that is I guess the fabric of the limelight. Thanks for a great movie. I may have to go see it again.
just got home from seeing country strong and first off GARRETT HEDLUND WAS SO AWESOME IN THIs movie, the whole cast and crew were amazing! i cried but the ending was so shocking to me! the music was so heartfelt and i loved the chemsitry between leighton and garrett they were amazing! im so going to buy the soundtrack because the music was awesome! this was one of my fav movies!
im just a summer grl,i wear my flip-fl0p and when i let my hair d0wn, that when the party starts. And wh0 needs a b0yfrnd? I g0t my grlfrnds and when we get together, the summer never end!!! we l0ve ths s0ng! My fave s0ng fr0m the s0undtrack!
This is an amazing movie! I can't wait to buy/upload the sound track! I expected Gwyweth Paltrow to be good but, wow, Tim McGraw is just as good and Garrett Hedlund has a wonderful voice. I think "Timing is Everything," the acoustic version he does, should be released to radio! Make sure to take tissue...I lost it during the scene on this picture, but then I'm a teacher.
This movie was REALLY good! COUNTRY STONG!!! Touching, Heart Felt,
What a great movie! Just downloaded the soundtrack!
Just saw the movie!!! Loved it and all the songs! Plan on getting the DVD and CD!!
Just went to see Country Strong and loved it so much that we went out to get the soundtrack! It is a well acted movie and just grabs you and pulls you in! Loved, loved, loved it!
just came back from seeing the movie...really enjoyed it, but wasn't expecting that ending. The music was great, the cast was terrific. Really nice to see Tim getting some meaty roles! :-)
Just got in from seeing the movie. I was blown away by the performances , the music,lyric and song quality. Strong performances by all and a incredible story line. everyone will be effected by this film. See it, own it, buy the soundtrack, don't miss out. I loved the quail.
Just saw this amazing movie and I am ready to watch it again. Truely remarkable and very emotional. 
wow just saw Country Strong tonight powerful movie I laughed and cried I love this movie Gwyneth Paltrow and Tim McGraw did awesome this has got Oscar winner all over it two thumbs way up from your fan in Oklahoma, Lawrence
Just saw Country Strong and I have to say, it is an absolutely beautiful film!
this movie was great. so sad at the end. definately wasn't expecting it
Just watched Country Strong this morning! Mind-blowing! Totally didn't expect it to be THAT good, but I love love love love it(: 
Went to see it in Madisonville Ky Friday nite..Very good movie...I hate to say it, Leighton and Garret were definitely the heart and soul of this movie. Sang great together and solo... Disappointed that Tim didn't sing.
This movie is awesome!! Loved it...go see it and you will be amazed at the depth of character this movie holds. The love and passion will grab your hearts attention.
I just loved the movie, it was one of the best movies that I have seen since The Blind Side!! I hope you all keep bring more movies out like this one because I would go see everyone of them!! How can I find the Soundtrack for this movie because I liked the music the best!!
I vote this movie the BEST movie of 2011! LOL I dont care what movies come out the rest of the year! It was amazing! It made me feel like I was actually there! And Beau your sexy! You should keep your scruff! :) I am a huge country fan! Go line dancing every wednesday night! :) Country Strong was aMAZING! :) 
Wow....just what an amazing movie. I loved every part of it, and I am now a HUGE fan!
Just got home from the theatre seeing Country Strong. The movie was everything that I hoped it would be and more! I loved Gwyneth as Kelly; by the time the concert in Dallas hit the screen I was ready to hear more of her music!! Kudo's to Tim and the rest of the cast! Loved this movie!!!!
just saw the movie ... LOVED IT! and didn't want it to end! Congratulations to you all!
I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed this movie. I had no idea that Tim McGraw was not only an excellent singer but a very talented actor. Gwyenth Paltrow is not only beautiful but a true asset to this movie. Everyone who played a part in this film was absolutely wonderful and I thank you so much for creating such an inspirational piece. It's been a very long time since I enjoyed a movie this much. Thank you!!
Just saw the movie and it was great. Gwyneth Paltrow is great in this movie and her singing is really good. Love the singing by Beau (Garrett Hedlund) and Leighton Meester.
Congratulations to Shana Feste and the rest of the Country Strong creative team. What an amazing story with great performances! I'm recommending it to my friends in hopes this movie grows legs in the coming weeks with all this word of mouth!
Great movie - shed a few tears!
This was a great movie! Gwyneth Paltrow's singing was great/refreshing. And performances by Tim McGraw & Leighton Meester were to be commended. The songs were awesome & touching..and my favorites are Give in to Me by Faith Hill; and Coming Home & Country Strong by Gwyneth.
i just got back from seeing country strong and I fell in love with the movie
Just went & saw this movie. Don't know what I expected but I loved it. I did cry !!
Best movie I've seen in a long time...LOVED IT FROM BEGINNING TO END!!!!! 
Not a big country music fan but I loved this movie!! Loved the music and the story line (cried at the end) and I especially loved Garrett Hedlund!! He has an awesome voice for someone who just learned to sing and play guitar for the movie. 
Saw the movie yesterday makes me diqn country music a whole lot more... it was so touching why did kerry have to kill her self :( .. again <3 love <3 the movie cast sound tracks everything was just fantastic! 
Just saw this movie last night. SO GREAT! My ex got me into country music (not my all-time favorite, but I still like it), and oh God. Such great music and actors! And the guy who played Beau... : ) My friend cried at the end, though, when Kelly Canter died... : ( Gwyneth Paltow has got a set of lungs on her... Didn't recognize Tim McGraw until the credits rolled at the end...
Just saw the movie and it was awesome...worth the wait!!!!
Love this movie!!! Actually had chills up & down my spine watching it :) ....Gwyneth and Tim were great....Loved Gwyneth singing "Coming Home"... Also loved Garrett and Leightons songs and love story.... The soundtrack is Great too... I f you're not a Country Fan...you will be after seeing this.... :)
Absolutely loved this movie!! If you haven't seen it yet I recommend you do so asap!! &hearts;
Loved this movie, Leighton, Garrett, Tim and Gwenyth are all excellent. Adore the music too, just checked out More Music From the Motion Picture on iTunes and the official soundtrack. Check this one out next time you go to the theatre. 
Could you guys put a video of Leighton and Garret singing "Friends In Low Places"? I LOVE it!! :)
We loved the movie! And now we want the soundtrack.... A must see and the talent was awesome!
This movie is motivating and shows theirs more to life then just money and living the dream. We all have personal problems that can take negative effects on us. I believe this movie is for all passionate people that are trying to be some one out there or people that are trying to get back on their feet, it gives them hope, makes them look deeper into life. This movie was brilliant, 5 star for sure! (The Directing was outstanding and the Cinematography was also stunning, great work!)
Okay so im very disappointed: I am in love with the movie and couldnt wait to get the soundtrack, untill i just found out that the songs from the movie that are sung by Leighten and Garrett are not on there, apparently Faith Hill sang that song. She did a wonderful job too but I wanted the soundtrack, the songs from the movie!! SO torn on what to do now. My boyfriend even said to me, I would love to dance with you at our wedding to that song... dont think that can happen. Please do something about this. :(
This movie was well worth the wait! Everyone is truly talented and the story is great. I was suprised that the theater was pretty packed :D 
WOw, what a compelling movie..<3 <3 <3...
Wow just saw this movie 30 mins ago n wow it was amazing. Goes to show you what fame can do to you!!! 
Absolutely LOVED this movie. I had tears and laughter throughout! I am itiching to see it again ASAP!!!
"Country Strong" is so good. Just went to see it today. Fell in love with this movie and the songs. I love country music because it is heart felt. I wasn't a country music fan before I moved to America then I lived in Idaho then I listened to it, now it's my favorite type music I listen to. The actors are amazing. Especially the song "Give In To Me" by Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester duet song. Those two are so cute! They have beautiful voices. Then there's Gwyneth Paltrow as an actress, singing, and playing the guitar, awesome! Also, love Tim McGraw on this movie. WELL DONE JOB! Listen to songs: "Country Song", "Coming Home," and "A Little Bit Stronger."
Gwyneth girlfriend here is the big question every body wants to know: are you going to make a career change from an actress to a country singer now that we see you are a multi-talented individual or are you going to be super woman and try to do both? lol -margie allison white pine tn-
I just came from seeing Country Strong! WOW! This movie is exceptional! It pulled on all of my heart strings. The music is superb! This is a must see! I cannot wait for it to come out on DVD....I will be buying it to watch over and over! 
I just now came away from Country Strong in awe, Gwyneth a magnificent actress, from the megawatt smile, to the tears to the touching music WOW ! Garrett Hedlund, oh! my! the smile, his beautiful teeth and then the voice WOW ! All the actors portrayed convincing parts; spaectacular movie. I was saddened intensely towards the end exacerbated by my own loss of a beautiful son in a like manner, Good music ... Loved it Bridget from Ormond Beach FLA
I picked up the CD soundtrack to the movie because I had to have some songs with Garrett Hedlund singing but he only has one song on the offical soundtrack. So I found out from some other posts that if you go to iTunes and search for "Country Strong (More Music from the Motion Picture)" you will find alot of the songs from the people actually singing them in the movie. My favorite is the Duet Garrett sings "Give in to me". On the offical soundtrack Faith Hill is singing it. Check it out!
Just saw this movie and it was so good!! It was amazing! 
Amazing performance by Gwyneth Paltrow. One of the very best movies I've seen in a while. Some profanities bother me, but otherwise, a must see masterpiece for all who've ever struggled with addictions or loved someone who has.
I was moved. I laughed, I cried, & mostly...I was heartbroken. Absolutely beautiful movie.
I loved this movie! Everything about it was fantastic! I've already seen it twice and have a date to see it for a third time this weekend. I fell in love with the soundtrack and have already bought it off of iTunes. It's all i've been listening to all week!
What else do you do when the snow keeps piling up, go to the movies and guess what see a WINNER. Good movie, good music , great actors-new and old.....
Absolutley LOVED this movie!! Can not wait for it to come out on DVD. Looked up the soundtrack and found that some of the songs on it are sung by the original artists though and was hoping to find the duets and songs how they were sung on the movie..is there anyway to get those?
Better than I ever imagined it would be!! Must see......EXCELLENT!!!
wasn't expecting the movie to be so good because of all the reviews. BUT I loved it!!!!!!
What a great movie..great cast!!! Tearjerker for sure..I will be buyin this movie when it hits dvd..Love the soundtrack also! 
actors and actresses were absolutely wonderful... singing --- I could listen to it over and over

Just got home from seeing Country Song. I Loved it!
finally saw Country Strong last night. Totally impressed with the actors. They really were all incredible. Tears of joy (the dance at school) and deep sadness (the end) came very unexpected. Thank you for shedding light on the dark road of addiction and even mental health. A reminder of how fragile we all are- like songbirds.
Just saw the movie.... LOVED it!!! Great songs!
Just saw it tonight, it was really good! 5 stars!
Just saw this tonight. Loved it, loved it, loved it
pretty much the best movie i've ever seen <3 i feel like i walked out of the theater with a new life perspective :D
We really wish the movie was released here in Collingwood or at least in Barrie. I heard it was a great movie from friends and really want to see it. 
I just saw this last night. It was AMAZING!!!
in my heart ill always be country strong
Loved it! i was crying on my way out of the theater! it's soo good i don't care if i cry all over again. i can watch this movie over and over! Love is a beautiful thing...just like Gwyneth Paltrow said in the movie, "don't be afraid to fall in love". Great job! Can't wait until it comes out on DVD so i can watch it ove and over and over! 
I just saw this movie and just LOVE it!!!
this was such a powerful movie it touched my heart so much being a country fan and all
Just got back from seeing this movie! Loved it! Though I would've gone with a different ending for Kelly!
I just saw Country Strong! Awesome movie, great acting and great music. Thanks for introducing me to Garrett Hedlund!
absolutely LOVED this movie! Acting, singing, story...thumbs up!
I just saw it. BEST FREAKIN' MOVIE. <3
The verdict is in on "Country Strong": Movie?...Great; Music?...Fantastic; Leaving the theatre hopin' your "Beau" looks and smiles at you like the one in the movie?....Ahhhh......Priceless.........;0) 
Just saw the movie today. What an awesome movie. Tim & Gweneth did such an awesome job. Loved it !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great great movie......the cast was incredible and the music amazing....ending was a surprise.....I had tears.....Ms. Paltrow was amazing as she is in anything she does....Her voice was incredible.....Great genes in that family......I went to college at West Virginia University and love country music.....
I just started a fan page requesting that GWYN, GARRETT AND LEIGHTON go on actual TOUR!! HOW great and fun would this be! PLEASE get everyone to sign up so that maybe it will happen!!!!
I just saw this movie this afternoon and absolutely LOVED IT!!! Great job to everyone in the film! 
It was an amazing movie that touched my heart. Thank you. :)
Best Movie I have seen in an extremely long time. I just bought the soundtrack, however, and am dissappointed there are not more songs from Garrett Hedlund. As much as i love Faith Hill i truely wish Give in to me would be the version from the movie. All in all i am in love with the movie and the music!
Just finished seeing this movie, it was truly amazing. The cast was great!!! :) :)
I just seen the movie it was so good it made me cry..
This movie just rocked my world, blew my head off then asked me to dance the two step! WOW! I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it! This is one of the most BEAUTIFUL films I have EVER seen!
Just saw the movie yesterday, fantastic! I'm surprised by how the reviews slam "James" for being self absorbed. I thought Tim did a wonderful job of expressing without words how much he had been hurt by Kelli's actions in the past. At times it seemed like he could get past it and then just couldn't commit again. Loved all of the characters, thought they all did a great job of portraying real life, it ain't always pretty and there ain't always a happy ending. Wonder tho WHY was she drinking in the first place, like before she fell offstage...I don't recall that being addressed.
BEAUTIFUL,JUST BEAUTIFUL,WENT TO SEE THE MOVIE LAST NIGHT,CAN'T GET THE MUSIC OUT OF MY HEAD,WOW YOU ALL DESERVE AN AWARD,HOPE YOU GET IT.GOOD JOB.THANK YOU.
just saw the movie today, LOVED IT! love the cast, loved that is was filmed in Nashville. cant wait to see it out on DVD
This is by far one of the best movies, and I mean the best movie I have ever seen in my life, it really touched my heart, it is just so overwhelming to even put it into all the words I have to say about the movie and the music, it just blowed me away, I now have the song Country Strong stuck in my head all day long, Great movie, to be watched over and over.
I want to sing and my fairytale would come true already, my prince finds me lol really though.I want to live. And my kids and my future spouse to live happy most of the time for the rest of our life. Live till we are old, and be our true self, ourselves, normal but happier more successful. A family thats why this movie is my favorite.

just surpassed 1000 facebook "fans" today! I feel like I should celebrate or something :)
tonight's challenge...to make asparagus that my kids will actually eat (and maybe even like). I am open to suggestions if you have any!!
holy moly! I just realized that Take Part (Food Inc.'s blog) named us as one of their top 10 stories of the year! Totally caught me by surprise...but I will take it! http://www.takepart.com/news/2010/12/29/our-top-10-food-stories-of-2010?fb_js_fbu=757915220
must stop picking (and eating) the cashews out of our granola whenever I walk by! What is your weakness?
Love your blog! I just recently found out about it (from Eating Well magazine) and have since read a lot of it. I have a question for you: Do you use can beans or is it better to use dried beans? Thnks for inspiring me!
Not sure if you go to the Charlotte Regional Frmer's Mrkt but the middle covered shed does have local produce and meat. One of them "Rosemay Pete" will have Saturday Baby Spinach & Salad Mix, Carrots, Uggi's Garlic, Baby Sweet Potatoes, Parsley, and Dried/Ground Cayenne Peppers! When I go there is usally a line for his items. His spinach is wonderful.
Hey, Real Food, here's ideas for future Real Food challenges: Real Food on vacation. I don't mean like if you go to a foodie-destination like Portland or Napa, do Real Food while camping. Or Real Food at Disneyland or renting a house at the beach. Real Food on a road trip or at the airport [without packing a lot of snacks]. (We're planning our summer holidays over here, can you tell? I was just thinking last night how we're going to do real food while camping on the Oregon coast this summer!)
We went to Earth Fare tonight for free kids' night and LOVED it. Also made my own flour tortillas from scratch last weekend, and I don't think my family will ever let me buy them pre-made again since they liked the real ones I made so much. Your blog has been so inspiring - I am really looking forward to going shopping this weekend so we can begin our real food journey in earnest. Please keep writing!
Michael Pollan is going to be on Oprah Tuesday. And Lisa Ling will go investigate a meat packing plant.
I was wondering if you could do a blog post sometime about how you handle it when people offer your children cookies, candy, cupcakes, etc at school or other places. Thanks. :) 
New Recipe: Peanut Squash Soup http://www.100daysofrealfood.com/2011/01/17/recipe-peanut-squash-soup/
in yesterday's post I shared our standard rotation of go-to dinners (quesadillas, quiche, pizza, pasta, and breakfast for dinner)...what are yours??
is having fun with my new wheat grinder...but I would love advice if you have experience! Two questions: 1. When you grind the wheat & use it right away everything seems to be 10X more DeLiCiOuS than normal! What happens if you grind & save the flour for a week...same results? 2. Any tips on how to grind (fine vs. coarse) or berries to use (red wheat vs. soft pastry) for different dishes (like pancakes vs. noodles)?

Baegan (eggplant) masala Ingredients: 1-2 Baegan (eggplant) Your favourite masala 250gm plain flour 2 eggs Cheese (grated) Prepare your most favourite masala. Remove all bones from the meat first. Slice 1-2 baegan into thin slices. Powder each of them with white plain flour (I just press them firmly on a plate of flour and turn them over and do the same) and set them to the side. Beat 2 eggs in a separate bowl and heat pan ready with a little oil/ghee. Coat baegan in egg mixture and shallow cook them until crispy on both sides. Grate some really yummy melt-able cheese. In a baking dish, spoon some of the masala on the bottom to wet the dish. Try not to over lap them. Then sprinkle a little of the cheese over the top of the baegan then add a more of the masala and repeat this until you run out of baegan. On the top layer should be last masala and final sprinkle of cheese. Dish should have enough liquid from the masala to cook the whole dish when you place in a moderate oven.

Iron is essential for brain growth, and to fight infection. Iron deficiency is very common, especially in toddlers and women. If you or your child feels tired, is sick a lot, has a poor appetite or problems concentrating, ask your doctor to test iron levels. Foods high in vitamin C help your body absorb iron. Most green, yellow, orange, red or purple fruits and vegetables are high in vitamin C.

When you cut an onion, it releases a gas called, Propanethiol S-oxide. When mixed with certain enzymes in the onion, it creates a sulfur gas. These gases then get to your eyes and create a mild acid which irritates the eyes.

It is grapefruit.
On your eFlyer, there is a coupon for $5.00 off a $50. order. Do I need to print that out some way? I fear my color printer cartridge may be empty and the coupon is red. Or are these flyers with the coupon available at the store? Nice prices in this one!
Made your cinnamon apple pork tenderloin tonight. Delicious.
With the weather being so cold, we thought it would be nice to take a little vacation (with our imagination of course). To start out this Monday right, lets see if you can guess which island is the largest exporter of macadamia nuts and where they originated?
Don't dine out that often, so more than likely will go for what the tummy wants. When i was traveling for the union I would watch what I ate. We watch at home our meals. Maybe beef once or twice twice in the week, otherwise fish around twice, pork, and chicken. Lots of vegs, no potatoes, if we do sweet potatoes. no bread, if we have bread it is whole wheat.
Its the Mystery Item of the week! Weve been tryin harder to stump all out fans, so let the guessing begin!GoodLuck!
Bought some hamburger from Maines store today, when we got home and started to divide it into smaller bags the middle and bottom (which you couldn't see) was all gray and tacky. Why would Maines sell meat like this? It is like they took bad meat and hid it in fresh ground meat. Very disappointed!!!
Today is National Granola Bar Day! Peanut Butter is a popular ingredient for granola bar creation so lets test your PB knowledge. About how many pounds of peanut butter do Americans consume each year?

I would love to thank you Food Matters for this beautiful insides, tons of information that really educate me and others.. Love your new letters , and I am educating myself to become a raw foodist , everything I read about just feel so good about even just to think about.. Thank you again Food Matters and lot of prosperity in 2011. Eva Hartman
just watched this documentary on netflix and may i say it is brilliant! after watching "the beautiful truth" of the gerson therapy i thought i would look into this one as well. although i do love to eat my different variety of foods i do intake some raw vegies as well. i have always thought that too much vitamins was bad for you but not anymore. i do have one question though as i have taken doses of vitamins before because my father sells vitamins as in indepedent business but it gave me side effects such as naseua, vomitting, and upset stomach...is there such things as bad vitamins?
At one point we'd eat from the tree, from the ground. It was all life and therefore man didn't die. When he put death into his body, he started to die. - Elijah Muhammed. Eat to live.
It's just unbelievable how ignorant people like to be by simply ignoring the basic truth that all deceases are caused by the food we eat. And yes, we are what we eat and we have a choice. The society is poisoned by the corporation management and most believe that there is a pill for every ill. We are not taught to listen our bodies who in fact are our natural doctor. Brilliant film. Well done guys. 
Just watched Food Matters. I am so glad I did. Its amazing the things that are kept from us. Scary.
Any opinion on this, I wrote Eggland's Best re: red stamp on their eggs. "The EB stamp has also been a part of our product. We use this stamp to assure people that the eggs that they are buying are truly EB. The ink used in the stamp is a food safe dye very similar to the dyes used in frosting. A very small amount of the ink is used on each egg and typically dries very fast and does not enter the shell of the egg. I am assuming that Dr. Oz was talking about food safety concerns with meat passing harmful bacteria onto other food products. The stamp on our egg is safe to be used on and in food." 
I have Lupus and when I saw the doco on Rialto, it helped open up more avenues of health and healing for me. I believe nature provides all we need to be whole and well, lets turn to Mother Earth and let her care for us :)
Great documentary..."You are what you eat"!!!! Maybe if we ate more raw and organic fruits and vegetables and took vitamins, we would not have the health care problems that we have today.
I love this movie and wish I saw it a long time ago. I'm changing the way and what I eat. Thank you;o)
just watched your movie on Netflix, no one spoke or moved the entire time. we had several aha moments, and were surprised how much we already knew, but that knowledge had been surpressed by overload from label reading, news bites, etc. both of us have chronic diseases, and want to be healthy. my question: how do you think Crohns disease begins? I have been in remission for 15 yrs, and I don't want it back. HOW CAN I DO THIS??
just finished watching this movie on Netflix.... loved it!

Just made the Moroccan Unstuffed Pepper recipe from your new book. It is very good! My older daughter won't touch it but she has autism and sensory processing issues so i didn't expect her to the first time around. She did at least say it smells good. Maybe next time!
Cheesy Spinach Bake is so yummy!

Made your Peter Pumpkin eater waffles today because I finally got a waffle maker for Christmas!! They were delicious and so filling. My kids loved dipping them in applesauce. Thanks!
Thank you so much for the "Cookie Swap" book! My Fed-Ex man just delivered and my stomach is deciding what recipe to whip up first! Thinking Valentine's Day would be a great day to host a swap! :-)
Hi Ladies: Just listened to your new episode. Such great tips! About protein powder, I've never given it to my kids (ages 2 and 4), though I've wondered if it safe to give to them or if it has additives that aren't good for kiddos. We are vegetarian, so I'm always looking for creative ways to make sure we are all getting enough protein (we LOVE cooking with quinoa!).
We made Cheesy Fish Sticks last week. We used catfish nuggets we found at our grocery store. I cut up one nugget into bite size pieces for our 20 month old daughter. After a few bites of the fish she started to refer to them as goldfish (more goldfish, please). She got this fish mixed up with goldfish crackers which she sees at daycare but we don't allow her to eat. I'm wondering if she kept gobbling it up because she thought they were crackers!
Made sugar and spice pecans yesterday. Yery yummy. I used 1/2 a bag of pecan,s 1/2 a bag of walnuts.. both leftover from Christmas baking... perfect
Just made the luau chicken with carrots and pineapple - it was so tasty! 4 YO and husband ate a bunch. I think I'll add cashews next time. THANKS!
My daughter had her first granola bar yesterday. She shared my Grab and Go granola bar with me. Her face on her first bite --- pure delight! Truly!
Your new cookbook is proving to be my favorite Christmas gift this year - I am a big fan of the South of the Border Tortilla Soup, Cheesy Broccoli Soup, and Penne with Chicken and Broccoli! I want to try the Luau Chicken next :)
I need a tip on the best/easiest way to skin a chicken sausage. I tried to do it the other day it took forever. I put the chicken sausage in with tomato sauce instead of ground beef but it was way too sweet. Oh well. I took a chance.
I enjoy your podcasts. I was alone all day for an outdoor flea market this past summer and had time to listen to many podcasts, some were yours. That was the only chance I had to listen without interruption. :-) My favorite is your pumpkin podcast since I buy pumpkin all year round.
Thank you Thank you Thank you!!! Our meal times are so much more peaceful since I started using both of your cookbooks in December. My 7 year old has sensory integration issues so eating, especially texture, has always been a challenge. He loves many of your recipes! He tries them because he enjoys getting to rate them on the sheet from your website. Now I can cook things that are nutritious and please both my husband and my son. What a blessing! 
Just wanted to say Thank You and love the new cookbook! I made the Oodles of Orzo w/Zucchini last night and my husband & 2 daughters ate every bite. My husband (my pickiest eater!) said to make sure I put it in the dinner rotation. Thank You and keep podcasting. :)
So we tried the spaghetti zucchini pie. We liked the combination of the spaghetti with the shredded zucchini but didn't like so much the baked egg taste it had. We will definitely make the spaghetti/shredded zucchini combo again, and maybe even add in a shredded carrots too!
Oh I forgot, I also made the Double Strawberry Smoothie pie. The crust was great! It was crunchy which I actually perferred to typical graham cracker crusts. The filling was interesting. I don't say that to make it sound bad, we just didn't expect it to be so firm. It has inspired us to check into making our own jello. Blending up those strawberries smelled so good, they are hard to resist!
For Christmas I received your No Whine With Dinner cookbook. Tonight I made the Garden Turkey Meatballs and made the Super Veggie Pasta Sauce to serve with them. The children loved them both.
I'm looking for healthy lunches that I can send with my son. He wants to bring something to warm in the microwave. We did a trial run with cheese tortellini, EVOO + a bit of parmesan cheese, which went over well. Bonus points if it's a one-bowl dish! (Also good to note: he's my adventurous eater.) Thanks in advance!

I have a question if you dont mind. Yesterday, I happened to be in Phoenix and I needed gas. I went to the Frys gas station on Glendale Ave and 19th Ave. I scanned my card and started pumping. As I was pumping, I noticed it didnt give me my discount. I got the attendants attention and she proceeded to help me. We stopped pumping and tried it again. It didnt work yet again at the pump, so we went to the booth and scanned. She then told me I did not have enough points to utilize it. I asked if the points from Dec. rolled over and she told me "No, sorry, all it says you have are 41 points from Jan.". I finally got back to my home and checked on my comp. and it says that I do have 41 from Jan. but also 82 from December. Shouldnt I have been able to use my points then? Please help me out and let me know if I am misunderstanding the policy. I quit pumping at a little over $28 but I do not live in Phx and would have liked to have filled up. Thank you.
The Fry's e-coupons page isn't loading. A page comes up and says there is an internal error. Is it just me or it there a problem with the site?
Just saw the FB site for Coffee-mate and noticed that they have many flavors I have not seen at my Fry's store. Wish you could add some more flavors. Fry's is my main store, and I do appreciate the specials and the e-coupons!
just wish Fry's was a little closer to my home...
Did anyone bother to get the chicken sandwich from the coupon posted yesterday? I got two today - FORGET IT. I enquired at the deli and she reached down and handed me two already packaged. Not made to order. No idea how long they were sitting there. Got them home and all there was, was a slab of chicken. Nothing else. The picture shows pickles on the bottom, and the top bun is raised so that it appears there is "something" there too. The bun was not very fresh either. Forget it. Don't waste your money. I'll stick with McDonalds $1 chicken sandwich.

If the rumors are true, and you are bringing back competitor's coupons AND all coupons being worth a dollar on Wednesday... THANK YOU times 1,000!!! 
Thank you so much for bringing competitor coupons and all coupons are $1 back! A question on competitor coupons, I have come coupons from my commissary that say "Military Store Coupon" instead of "Manufacturer's Coupon" on the front, so would these be accepted or not? If not, would you consider adding commissary coupons to your competitor coupon list? Thanks!
First, thank you SO much for bringing back the latest coupon policy, want to clarify: "Competitor coupons will be accepted on identical items, no substitutions. * For competitor brand items use our comparable brand item" So, if it's Albertson's brand egg coupon or Safeway bread or something like, then we can get the Fry's/Kroger brand of the same size with the coupon?
Thanks Fry's for bringing back competitors! Unfortunately some people have gone to Fry's this morning and getting what I believe is wrong information. Can you clear this up for us please? Let's say you buy 2 nabisco crackers and you have one target coupon for $1 off 2 crackers and you have a manufacturer coupon for $1 off 2 crackers, you can use these two together to get a total of $2 off 2 crackers correct? Some people are being told by Fry's managers and cashiers that in this case you would need to get 4 crackers. Please advise! Thanks!
Thank you, thank you, thank you for bringing back the $1 coupons and competitor's coupons promotion!! You simplified my life and tremendously edified the food for my family of 5. :) :) :) 
We went grocery shopping @ Frys....ads & shopping list in hand....filled our cart & we racked up a bill of $131.00!!! They're having a Mega event sale & we had a competitor's coupon for $5 off...we walked out paying $48.63!!!! The cashier said with eyes bulging, "You saved ....WOW!! $73.34!!!! You saved 60% off your total...That's pretty good!!" Thx Frys!! :) 
I am sooo excited competitor coupons is back! WOOT I love you Frys!!! I cant wait for our HOT HOT date tomorrow ;)
thanks for bringing back the coupons to equalling $1.00
Fry's: Please ask cellfire.com to give a longer window of opportunity to load coupons on when they have a "free money" give away on your card. Do you pay for this? If you are I just wanted to let you know that there are so many frustrated customers of yours who cannot get the site to work. A longer log in to get your coupon might be in order. This is not the first time they've run this promo and every time the server crashes. If you pay them perhaps they will listen to you! I'm sure you don't want frustrated customers. Thanks as always for great deals!
Fry's I had such a great experience tonight while shopping at your store! I am so glad that this week with competitor coupons and all coupons are a dollar, I do not have to go to a billion stores...Just Yours! I shopped at your phoenix location 1815 W Glendale Ave and my cashier's name tag said BN. She was so patient with all my coupons and made for an amazing experience!!
Can you tell me if there is a limit to the number of Mega deals you can do in one transaction? I had 40 items and only took off $15. Plus 3 of my $1.00 coupons did not come off. So that's $8 in savings I missed out on. Can you please advise?? Otherwise I had an awesome shopping trip. Thanks for bringing back the coupons to $1 and taking the competitor's coupons!!!
I just have to let you know how amazing the stock boys are at the Casa Grande Florence blvd Frys are not only do they assit in special orders, but anytime and item is out the will stop what they are doing and unpile box after box to find the item i am wanting. As well as being greeted and asking if they can help me with anything! And this is one more reason why i love my Frys
Well, since it's National Compliment day, the cashiers Jaime and Angie at your Fry's in Sierra Vista are absolutely AWESOME :) I always enjoy my shopping when I know it's one of them who's going to check me out!
I mostly shop at Fry's at 91st Ave and Olive in Peoria. I have had some really great encounters there. I use a lot of coupons and I know as a cashier it isn't always easy with the competitor coupons. Dani Sue always shows the most patience, kindness and professionalism when I come in with my stack of coupons :) Can you please pass along to her manager what a great job she does!?
Today I went to the Frys Marketplace on Pinal Ave. in Casa Grande and had an Albertsons coupon for Albertsons 24pk water for $1.99 so I got the Frys 24pk of water and went to checkout but the Customer Service lady said that Frys is not taking competitor for store brand items but when I read the post on facebook it says that they should. Can you please tell me if they should or not?
Today my Fry's refused to accept a Target coupon for a free box of Crunchy Nut cereal with the purchase of a box of another Kellogg cereal. The cashier stated they don't accept "free item" coupons from competitors. Can you verify if this is your policy??
I just want to thank you for bringing back competitors coupons and $1 coupons. In these tough economic times, it really helps to know I can count on Fry's to help me deliver great food to my family for great prices. :)
Yesterday was the last day of our Holiday Food Drive, and weve got to sayyou all really delivered! We generated a total of $124,300, which correlates to 870,100 meals for hungry Valley families. In addition we raised more than $43,000 to purchase turkeys benefiting the Salvation Army. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you!
It's finally here: tonight's the BCS Championship game between the Oregon Ducks and the Auburn Tigers! Who are you rooting for?

Ferguson team wins the Iron Chef competition at the GE Monogram Experience Center GE invited a group of sales associates from different companies across the country to the GE Monogram Experience Center in Louisville, Ky., to learn about the GE appliances and what their capabilities are. For three days, the attendees cooked their meals on the appliances with the help of two chefs: Joe Castro and Brian Logsdon. In between the cooking, the sales associates learned all of the little details that make GE products unique. It was wonderful to learn about the features and benefits and to be able to come back and share our new knowledge with our customers, says Inside Sales associate Kristin Fritz. On the last day of training, the chefs asked the attendees to use the knowledge that they acquired at the training and put it to use in an Iron Chef competition. The chefs prepped different items for them to use along with the special ingredient of dried cherries to make three dishes. Kristins team consisted of all Ferguson associates: Brandon Hankins from Fresno, Calif., Robert Armstrong from Monterey, Calif., and Kristin from Salt Lake City, Utah. Knowing that Chef Castro spent time in Asia honing his cooking skills, the team decided on an Asian-themed meal of egg rolls, chicken fried rice, and sweet and sour chicken. They also made sure that they included the dried cherries. The chefs gave the teams 45 minutes total to complete the dishes and clean their stations. In the end, the Ferguson team won by showing not only did they learn about the GE products, they knew how to use them to make prize-winning meals. It was so much fun, and we won gold medals for getting first place, says Kristin. I feel like it was one of the best training sessions I have ever attended!

Sometimes little ones just need to be alone...after a lovely morning working in the kitchen and playing silly with 2yo DD, she just wouldn't wash her hands.

An Update on Homemade Deodorant
I have a question - that I'm hoping you or one of the readers can answer. We have chosen to not have a microwave in the house. The one thing that we cannot seem to replace with it is how to heat up our natural heating pads. They are filled with rice and then you microwave them for a couple minutes. Is there another way to heat them, that won't ruin them? Or is there something else we can use? I don't feel a microwave is worth it for that one thing -- but we need something to put on our aches and pains!

Like the cheese package and other random packaging. Does that mean I should not recycle it? Or if it has food in it, should I assume it can be recycled b/c it's food safe? And what about Ziploc type bags--I can't find a number on those things or the box anywhere! I'm so excited, I just want to recycle it all! LOL!

Woke up worried that my fancy black boots, which I was planning to wear w/a few outfits at Blissdom, were visibly falling apart and didn't think I'd have time to find new ones. Compared to all the heart-breaking prayer requests for family and friends with cancer and tragedy at Bible Study, boots mean nothing. God bless you and your priorities today!

Okay, it's not a cookbook, but I'm also fascinated by these old quack remedies! Check out this nifty find - an 1880s box of women's "health pills" still in the original wrapper. Oh, it's soooo tempting to open them up (but I won't! :-)
Just listed!
I returned from this morning's farmers market with beets, cabbage, carrots and red onions - yup, I've got a yen for borscht! Does anyone have a favorite recipe to share?

Try making it a habit to surround yourself in positivity. In spite of a challenging day, some time spent surrounded by positivity can help to uplift your spirits. Listening to CDs while driving works quite well. Always be mindful of those you associate. Being around positive/motivated people that care about your well being can make all the difference. Sometimes just having another's ear is all it takes.
Fed Ex just brought my cheese cake~thank you! <3

THE MOST AMAZINGGGG and DELECTABLE raw and gluten free cheesecake I have ever tasted! ~ Nicole LA Examiner.com Gluten free writer
Are any of these delicious cakes Paleo friendly?? please please!!
Jamie Oliver had lots of support yesterday as he launched his Food Revolution. His 1st goal, is taking on the LA Unified School Dist. His crew was filming for what I think will be this season's opening show. I spoke 1 on 1 w/Jamie (which was filmed, we'll see if it makes the show) about the politics tied to all of this. With no doubt, he's the right guy to get the job done to improve the food choices in our schools!
Will it be today?? We're about 10 friends away from reaching 3,000. As you so well know by now, when we hit our mark 3 random folks who entered our contest will get 1 of our GF/dairy free cheesecakes. If you have already entered (expressed interest) great, if not, what are you waiting for.:)...
Drifting into a negative mindset is easy to do. That's why it's important to take perodic attitude tests. Meaning, consciously checking in w/yourself. If you're in a funk, focus on those things that bring you pleasure, things that you enjoy. Play a motivational/inspirational CD while in your car. Slipping into a funk is normal, it's being human. The secret/goal is to get out of that space as quickly as possible...
Mommy Katie's Valentines Day Giveaway of our Gluten & Dairy Free Cheesecakes. Check it out...
Have a raw cashew... Cashews are rich in magnesium (beneficial for promoting bone growth), antioxidants (helps in eliminating free radicals that can cause cancer), high in copper (important for flexibility in bones, joints & blood vessels), they pack a high amount of dietary fiber (which has a good effect on weight management) & make they for an excellent raw cheesecake filling.:).
Seriously now, who needs NFL Playoff Football when there is cheesecake GIVEAWAY in process. Come on now, which makes better sense.:)
Have confidence in your ability. Situations & events may not always be the way you want them, some may disappoint you & others might not support your dreams. That is why it's important to have confidence & believe in yourself. Develop the attitude to be able to tell yourself that 'you can do it'. Eliminating self-doubt will help you achieve your goals & face more confidently whatever challenges come your way.
Attitude affects all aspects of your life, from how you handle stress to how you act & react at home. The way you view difficulties & setbacks can make the difference between your success & failure. Communication is key. Not saying the things you feel can lead to a sense of frustration, hurt & anger. Be kind, be understanding. Allow yourself to be approachable by others & have them feel comfortable in your presence.
He really was a great traveling companion! He was my first Vegan friend, and I have learned a lot from him.
It's time that we have another 'Giveaway' don't ya think? When we reach 3,000 friends, 3 lucky folks will get 1 of our GF/dairy free cheesecakes:).

We're less than 150 friends away from hitting 3,000. As you know, when we reach 3,000, 3 random folks (that have entered our Giveaway) will get 1 of our GF & dairy free cheesecakes.:).

And then there were 5 & dropping.:). I'm about to say 2,995 is close enough to 3,000 so I can head off for the gym. But no, that just wouldn't feel right.:)
A handful of raw almonds gives you about 25% of your daily needs of magnesium & it has more calcium than cow's milk. Almonds (be sure to soak) are also rich in antioxidants Vit E & selenium. Studies support that they may play a key role in preventing colon cancer due to the high fiber & they help lower negative forms of cholesterol in your blood. Around 10 almonds offer the same amt. of protein as a lb. of meat.
Fresh off the Press review by Nicole Sirote from LA Gluten-Free Food Examiner of our Gluten & Dairy Free Cheesecakes...
There are just so many 'Queens of England' to go around. Then there is the rest of us. Regardless as to one's opinion, this is your moment. This is your moment, right here, right now, present time. Make this your Grand Performance, your Grand Spectacle, your Finest Hour. It is your Divine right to Live, to Love & to Enjoy every aspect of this experince. To Devour & Savor every moment like there truly is no tomorrow..
Back to the Basics, I know it's not glamorous but; please be mindful about drinking water. It's hugely important for helping w/weight loss & mgmt., healthier skin, a healthier digestive system, reduce fatigue, healthier joints/teeth & bones, reduce joint pain, reduce fluid retention & increase muscle tone. Also, here's our December Newlsetter (click on December to view)... 
How about some Rockin' Raspberries for they're high in ellagic acid, a phenolic compound that may help prevent cancer, inhibit the growth of cancer cells & stop the growth of some cancers. Raspberries are also packed with fiber & manganese. Fiber helps slow the digestive process so you feel full longer. Manganese is a trace mineral that helps keep your metabolic rate high which in turn burns fat...
A few relationship reminders, things you would never consider doing while dating should remain so once you're in a relationship. Show respect & be a good listener. Compliment the dinner. Stay involved in each others lives & have/develop common interests. Always open the door (guys, duh). Talk things out, never go to bed angry. Be supportive, be someone that can be counted on to be there when the going gets tough...
Our feelings, beliefs & knowledge are based on our internal thoughts, both conscious & subconscious. You're in control, whether you know it or not. The biggest difference between people is their attitudes. The first step in changing one's attitude is to change your inner conversations. Dream of Success, Be Enthusiastic, be enjoyable for others to be around & always look to praise those closest to you...
Well, we have our 2nd Winner. Does anyone feel a bit tingly.:)
Address potential negative issues as they surface. Dont allow them to potentially derail your positivity, happiness & enthusiasm. Don't anticipate undesirable events, situations or outcomes. Allow nothing to spoil the joy that lies in the present. Deal w/one issue at a time as they occur, do it completely & thoroughly. This will help free you from worrying & will give you a positive approach for the task at hand.
GatherGreen.com is running an unbelievable (basically a half-price) special on our Gluten & Dairy Free cheesecakes. Hurry, it only lasts for 2 more days. Quantities are limited...
Our 3rd Winner is - Cindy Quisenberry. Congratulations Cindy!
Keep it movin', it matters little how many times you may encounter a setback. What matters though is that you get back up, learn from your experience & press forward. Regardless as to how the odds may appear, regardless what others may say... it comes down to your perseverance, your belief system, your 'how badly do I want it' mindset that will set you appart from the rest of the herd...
We're about 100 friends away from hitting 3,000. At 3,000, 3 random folks, that have entered our 'Contest' will get 1 of our GF & dairy free cheesecakes.:). If you refer someone, be sure they or you let us know. The more referrals, the better your chances of winning...
20 minutes to go before our 1st Winner is announced. Tick, Tock, Tick, Tock...
Thinking positively doesn't mean denying that there is anything wrong. Rather, it allows you the ability to think constructively about the events/happenings that led up to your current situation so you can avoid them, or better deal w/them in the future. It affords you the opportunity to look towards & anticipate a more positive tomorrow. Have a Great Sunday!!
Let the Countdown begin! We're less than 50 friends away from 3,000. When reached, 3 random folks, who entered our contest will get 1 of our GF/dairy free cheesecakes. Remember, the more folks you refer, the better your odds of winning. Also, we had 11 new stores place orders w/us yesterday. This is largely thx to all of you requesting us at your local Nat Foods Mkt. THANK YOU! You might find us now in your backyard.
Avoid assuming too quickly. Take a few moments to consider the situation before you react, make certain that you have a clear understanding of everything. Whether a disagreement or misunderstanding, avoid a snap judgment & placing blame. By having another feel that they're on 'the witness stand', can potentially cause tension & negative emotions to take hold. Think openly & keep negative assumptions away..
Striving to improve one's self-esteem is on the mind of many. It doesn't matter if you actively pursue this goal or you are working on it subconsciously. Learn to always feel good about where you are now, in the present & to exude self-confidence about anywhere you might find yourself tomorrow. Be proactive, take the initiative & be decisive.
Ahhh we are now 3 peeps away. The Finish Line is at our finger tips. 3 Free Cheesecakes is in the near term future of?????
We're now 5 minutes away...
A person with the right mental attitude sees & focuses on what they get to do, not what they have to do. They see & experience their life with enjoyment, not drudgery. They know that if they want to achieve a particular outcome they must commit to it & understand the process. They may not find pleasure in every minute of their journey but their attitude & core belief system helps them achieve their desired results.
8 friends away & dropping from reaching 3,000!! 3 FREE GF/Dairy Free cheesecakes are getting ready for their new homes.:).
No one needs to feel that they're left out, overlooked or left behind. Be patient. If it's a healthier, more loving relationship you desire, look forward to the day. A better, more desirable job, see in your mind the day you're driving to your new office. Never give up, never throw in the towel. Life is a series of tests of your belief system.

It begins at 12:00 pm, the address is 1038 Westwood Blvd. He plans to bring better food choices into the LA Unified School Dist.

Please keep Congresswoman Gabriel Giffords & the other victims (and their families too) that were shot over this past weekend in your thoughts & prayers. Congresswoman Giffords is a friend/supporter of ours & a very well respected member of Congress.
Can't you just taste Rockin' Raspberry or Who's Your Daddy waking up your taste buds to a mouth watering explosion???
Attitude + Determination + Persistence = Success!!! Allow nobody to waste your time in trying to convince you differently. Consider the source & keep it movin'. Wishing for all a most excellent Friday!
A few Saturday thoughts; our beliefs, knowledge & feelings are based on our internal thoughts, both subconscious & conscious. Whether you think so or not, you are in control. The big difference between people is their attitudes. The first step in changing one's attitude is to change the inner dialogue. Think of Success, Dream of Success, be enthusiastic and be the type of person others enjoy being around...
The Finish Line is now in plain view... We're 25 friends away from 3,000. As you know, when we hit our mark 3 random folks who entered our contest will get 1 of our GF/dairy free cheesecakes. Between the likes of all of us, it would only seem reasonable we would know 25 more people.:). If you have already expressed your interest great, if not, best hurry.:)... Good Luck!!
1 minute away...
Being fearful essentially means one is lacking a gameplan, a strategy. They feel that their situation is out of their control. When you feel you're starting to slip in to the Fear Zone, understand you're in control. Take a step back from the issue at hand & ask yourself, "what's my best play right now, what's the best gameplan". Once you have steadied yourself & established your plan, fear will fall by the wayside.

Just love your great words of wisdom. The cakes look pretty good as well.
I haven't had your cheesecake in months, not since it so tragically disappeared from Portland. I am going through serious withdrawal. So yeah I hope I win one.
To whom it may concern: I am a stay at home mom, fashionista and a mom-treprenuer and I just started a product review blog entitled Shopaholic Mommy's Must Haves. I provide written reviews on products for all walks of life. I also like to include my family in the reviewing process. I have reviewed products for great companies like Tocca, Love n Lace, Herbal Essences, ColorOn Professionals, and others and I will be reviewing products for companies like Hanes, LuLus, Love&Lace, and Pillow Pets to name a few. I also like to hold giveaways, when possible, for my readers. I have found that giveaways are a great way to bring in customers. Who doesn't love the chance to win something? I am currently seeking sponsors for upcoming reviews and I would be thrilled to have a chance to review something for you. I know my readers would be just as excited! If you're interested, feel free to email me back with any questions you may have. Have a wonderful day! God Bless! --Ashley Ruzin
I have been growing sprouts and so far I like radish sprouts the best and lentils the least. I would be interested in others' favorites and least favorites so that I can keep trying new varieties.
Excited to take a work trip to California next week...primarily because I know I'll be able to get some cheesecake! Still hoping you get distribution in Ohio! I know people would scarf up your products at my local Whole Foods!

I got the word on the new dumplings and the giveaway from Celiac Chicks and I am so excited. My 3 year old always asks me is this gluten-free with whatever she is eating so she can share her food with me and now she will be able too =) We both love dumplings but I haven't had them in about 2 years. 
I've never had dumplings before and I can't wait to try them..thanks Celiac Chicks !!
I just heard about your dumplings from Celiac Chicks. I am so excited! I have not had a dumpling in 16 years. Thanks for making them and I hope to find them in California soon.

Massachusetts needs dumplings
I started fooling around with wheat free and Gluten free recipes when my daughter was told she had a wheat allergy last year. It is amazing to me how many creative foodies there are around who have risen to the call and developed healthy, tasty alternatives to bread doughs and pastries, cookies, pastas, etc. This morning when I got the email from Celiac Chicks about the dumplings they are making and the giveaway contest, I just smiled, sat back and thought, this isn't going to be so hard after all. Keep up the good work. It is SO very much appreciated!
So excited to hear about GF dumplings....just heard about the giveaway from Celiac Chicks....thanks!!!! Hope to see you in AZ soon!

 I made a pilgrimage to Friedman's Deli from my home in California and was delighted to eat a corned beef sandwich on GF bread. Would be so great to find your dumplings in a market here in the SF Bay Area. Both my 13 year old daughter and I eat gluten free. She would love these dumplings for a school lunch. Saw your dumplings on Celiac Chicks.
I've been waiting many years for gluten-free dumplings! I was just in the Natural Green Market but will check back now that I know about you and the giveaway thru Celiac Chicks.

To answer a couple of recent questions: Folks are TOTALLY welcome to share recipes with a nutrient analysis. However, it is not a requirement to be a TRAY OF THE DAY! The goal of this page is merely to showcase VISUALLY what is right with school meals today and I want to make it easy for folks to do that. Districts are always identified ... so you can check their website for additional information.
Our February Menu for the Healthier U.S. School Challenge! Maschio's Food Services is working with Clinton Township Schools in Clinton, NJ on this fantastic program. Our students have been suprisingly excited about the black beans!
This is one of the awesome custom-made wraps available at the middle and high schools in Westport, CT! This wrap features fresh sliced turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, green peppers and a slice of American Cheese. The student chose to grab some fresh vegetable "gardenaria" which is carrots, broccoli, onion, red wine vinegar and olive oil! YUM! The "Grab Apples" are a GREAT way to get students to eat more fruit and we sell out of them every day! Pair this fantastic lunch with a chocolate milk and I think it is a school meal that really ROCKS!
While I am encouraging TRAY OF THE DAY photos, I know how creative you all are ... and I am willing to be flexible! SO ... videos, drawings by children, nice noted from customers, they are ALL welcome here! You have to see this video from Valley City Schools in NORTH DAKOTA. Too bad JO did not feature them, because it sure looks their meals ROCK!
All feedback is important to me ... which is why I have left negative and positive comments for all to consider. I know that not all school meals look like the ones that ROCK here. For me, the KEY question is: if meals in our schools do not meet the standard of excellence that we should expect for all children, HOW do we take action to improve them? I'll have a list on Wednesday.
I liked Margo's Thursday comment about parental action. I believe that parents should always know whats available in school meals and help kids learn to make nutrient-rich choices that fit into their day. Sometimes that might be flavored milk or 100% juice and sometimes it might be white milk or broccoli. For more on parental responsibilities, read my blog about being MORE than role model. 
Starting week with Metro-Nashville (TN) School Food Services: WHY? 1: Nutrition Coordinator Deborah Walker, MA, RD, focuses on improving meals for kids ("Let Healthy Eating Lift You Higher"). 2: The School Nutrition Association Annual Nutrition Conference will be in Nashville this July. 3: GREAT Grab-and-go options are getting kids to eat more fruits and veggies in Nashville. Stay tuned for news from Music City ...
The "breakfast pizza". Low fat muffin pizza, topped with low fat cream cheese and tons of fresh fruit. 4j Nutrition, Eugene Or.
WEEK 4 7 beautiful trays from TN and VA, plus 50 more likes. For February, we will focus on the HEARTS of kids: What HEART healthy foods have you incorporated (whole grains, produce, beans etc.)? How do you win their HEARTS and minds with marketing? How will you celebrate Valentine's Day with HEART shaped foods? How do your meals warm their HEARTS on cold winter days? Send photos to SchoolMealsThatRock@gmail.com
WEEK 2 ... 7 gorgeous trays from OR making total of 12 trays from 4 states, PLUS 100 more likes. THANKS for your support!!
here is our one of our HS meals today--Southwest Burger on whole wheat bun with homemade pico de gallo and lime chipotle mayo, lettuce and tomatoes; spinach salad with sunflower seeds and balsamic dressing, fresh carrots and pineapple!
Here is Homemade (yes, I said HOMEMADE!) Red Pepper Hummus, Baked Tostito Scoops, edamame, fresh cuke slices, and a farm fresh Farm to School Apple from Northwest High School in Jackson, Michigan--our Elementary kids like it too!

We made traditional Rice Noodle Chicken Bowls for lunch at Northwest Kidder Middle School! Students could choose from fresh sliced green peppers, fresh pineapple and "Farm to School" apples!
I will take every opportunity to promote positive messages about school meals (and use the TRAYS OF THE DAY as examples!). This is about the new USDA Nutrition Standards for school meals, posted yesterday on the IFIC blog ... with a tray from Eugene, Oregon. 
From Will James Middle School in my Billings, Montana) neighborhood (my children attended this school) ... a Buffalo Chicken Wrap made with Frank's Redhot Sauce and lo-cal ranch dressing.
When school meals DO NOT rock - Plan a FORUM (Part 3)
Here's another lunch option from Will James Middle School in Billings (served just before Christmas). It is a Chicken Salad and low-fat milk, plus a selection of items available from the fruit/vegetable bar.
JoAnn Clements has done something incredible that I've never seen anywhere else. She has tray PHOTOS on Novi's nutrition site ... meal photos for K-4, plus photos of staff and daily fruit/veggie bar. Some trays include chocolate milk and 100% juice, but a child could easily ... with parental input, choose unflavored milk and whole fruit.
From Shannon S. Stember, RD, Assistant Director, Nutrition Services Portland Public Schools a truly impressive fresh-and-local TRAY OF THE DAY, with hand assembled lasagna featuring local marinara, leaf lettuce salad with marionberry vinaigrette, northwest apple and pear slices, and 1% lowfat milk. What lucky students ... and staff!
Another TRAY OF THE DAY from Portland, Oregon, Schools (www.pps.k12.or.us/departments/nutrition/), a chicken hot dog on a whole wheat bun made with Shepherd's Grain sustainable flour (www.shepherdsgrain.com/), leaf lettuce salad with marionberry vinaigrette, northwest apple and pear slices, and 1% lowfat milk. Gives a completely new meaning to seeing the words HOT DOG on a school menu!
New to this site, which I think is Great. My question is do you share Child Nutrition Receipes and do you have the Nutrition Values for them? Thanks.
With all the buzz about new USDA School Meal Standards this week, it's wonderful to know that so many districts are WAY ahead of the game with awesome TRAYS OF THE DAY. Kitchen Manager Cindy Shepherd at Parkside Elementary in Grants Pass, Oregon, is justifiably proud of their lovely Chef Salads, served with bread sticks, a choice of fruits and vegetables, and APPLESAUCE brownies. As she says "I am very thankful to work in a school district that is so supportive of Food Service and allows us to provide such wonderful, healthy, fresh meals."
I like that your avatar platter has apples in slices. I'm from WA state, close to Wenatchee, "Apple Capitol of the World". We know that children will choose apples sliced versus a whole apple. The lunch looks fabulous!
I was going to finish ALL OREGON week with Friday's TRAY OF THE DAY; then Rosa mentioned Eugene and I received this photo from Willamette High, Bethel School District (http://163.41.16.11/dept/nutrition) in Eugene. Jennifer Henchion, RD, and her staff served this Chicken and Cheese Quesadilla on Friday ... hot and fresh off the panini grill, using locally produced whole wheat tortilla's from Carmen's Tortilla Factory, fruit medley, and mixed salad with homemade low fat ranch dressing. Oregon schools have got it going ON!
WEEK 3 6 appealing trays from GA, MI, MS, and ND, plus 70 more likes. Take YOUR photo today and post it DIRECTLY or send it to me for posting: SchoolMealsThatRock@gmail.com
Only one more Oregon TRAY OF THE DAY for now, we need to give the other 49 states a chance to get in here!! Ashland school food service (www.ashland.k12.or.us/SectionIndex.asp?SectionID=82) wanted "to share some of the fabulousness available at our high school." I could not resist this Hot Turkey Wrap with 1/2 oz. cheddar for color (both are USDA commodities) and a light cilantro/jalapeno sauce (a recipe born of a typo on a menu that was already printed!). The salad is fresh spinach with red beans and a turnip stick. As the media continues to talk about the "dramatic changes needed in school lunch," I wish that they would go to Oregon for lunch, maybe with Gema Soto and her crew at the Ashland High School!
As I was thinking about Martin Luther King Day last week, I wished that I had asked for a TRAY OF THE DAY from one of the many schools named in his honor. Lydia Martin must have heard my prayers, since she submitted this wonderful lunch tray from the home state of MLK in Augusta, Georgia. Last Friday, Wilkinson Gardens Elementary (http://wilkinson.rcboe.org/) served a Toasted Cheese Sandwich (with reduced-fat cheese and 100% whole wheat bread), creamy light Yogurt, Niblet Corn, Tossed Salad with fat-free dressing, Oranges Halves, and 1% Milk. Simple, brightly colored, and very appealing!!
My fav way to see a TRAY OF THE DAY is on a table in front of me! Last Wednesday, it was my pleasure to join Mary Hill, Executive Director, Child Nutrition in Jackson (MS) Public Schools at Kirksey Middle School for this appealing lunch prepared by Mrs. Beatrice Johnson and her staff. The made-from-scratch Cheesy Chicken (Mississippi Cycle Menu recipe) over Brown Rice was truly delicious as were the green beans and tossed salad. The Kirksey cafeteria was beautifully decorated and the students clearly enjoyed the meal and the opportunity to socialize. KUDOS to Kirksey principal Dr. Buck and the JPS Child Nutrition Program!!
From Mississippi to Michigan, for a classic TRAY OF THE DAY from Novi Community Schools (www.novi.k12.mi.us/District/foodServices/). JoAnn Clements, SNS, Director of Nutrition and Food Service, chose this particular tray for a reason. This is the lunch that food service departments are often criticized for. However, these chicken nuggets are whole muscle (NOT processed) and baked (NOT deep fried). The fresh commodity apples are SLICED, the juice is 100% PURE juice, and the broccoli is also FRESH. The crackers are whole grain and the chocolate milk is low-fat. Not every school building in America currently has the equipment or the staffing to do lots of scratch cooking but it is possible to serve appealing, nutrient-rich meals like these anywhere! More about Novi's SCHOOL MEALS THAT ROCK tomorrow!
I have to give a special SHOUT OUT to Patti Russell and the beautiful Japanese lunch photos that she posted yesterday. In addition to sushi (!!), they made traditional Rice Noodle Chicken Bowls for lunch at Northwest Kidder Middle School! Students could choose from fresh sliced green peppers, fresh pineapple, and "Farm to School" apples! These food service folks in Jackson, Michigan, are proving that school meals are about more than just nutrient numbers and calories levels. School meals are also about exposing children to new foods and different cultures ... this lunch ROCKS!
Your website and what you are promoting is wonderful. Reminders though, about those beautiful apples in your avatar today. They need to be sliced or halved, I'm just saying. Apple slicing is quite easy with a device that cores and slices at the same time. Children will be more willing to take a few slices and eat them. A whole apple usually ends up with a bite taken and then tossed in the trash.
In todays release of 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, improvements in school meals were mentioned several times. Lisa Wiedner, RD, and her colleagues in the Food Service Department of Cypress-Fairbanks ISD (www.cfisd.net/dept2/food/default.htm), could be a poster program about healthful changes in school meals. This tray was served in a Cy-Fair ISD high school Power-Up Cafe (outside Houston, Texas) last week: Spicy Baked Chicken Sandwich on a Wheat Roll, California Blend Vegetables, Pineapple Tidbits, Fresh Spinach Salad, Sweet Potato Baked Confetti Fries, and Fat-free Milk. Real food, real good!

b'The XP-67, McDonnell\'s only propeller-powered fighter, made its first flight on January 6, 1944. Engineers tried to improve the airplane\'s aerodynamics by merging the center fuselage with rear portions of the engine nacelles. This resulted in the XP-67\'s unique bat-like shape and the aircraft\'s nickname "The Bat." The turbo-supercharged 12-cylinder, inverted-V, liquid-cooled engines would be housed in long nacelles and would drive four-blade propellers in opposite directions. They were to maximize the use of exhaust to increase engine thrust.'

b'Yesterday marked the 50th anniversary of the Douglas F4D Skyray. The single-place Skyray was named after the undersea manta ray it resembled. It was on the leading edge of aircraft design, could climb to 40,000 feet in two minutes and reach Mach 1 during a dive.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of data captured in Germany after World War II indicated that the delta-shaped wing would take the most advantage of jet propulsion for fast-climbing interceptor fighters. In 1948, Douglas signed a contract to build the F4D-1. Nicknamed "the 10-minute killer," the Skyray broke five world\'s time-to-height records. In 1953, the Skyray was co-winner with North America\'s Super Sabre of the prestigious Collier Trophy.'

My first year of canning and this is what I have left, my family liked everything so much it was hard to me to keep my shelves stocked.

We use Ball jars for everything at this house - canning jellies & veggies & meat & fruit, dry good storage, homemade soy candles, Dad's marble collection, Great Grandma's button collection, 4-H canning projects & workshops - but this might be my favorite - "preserved" memories of a 2nd honeymoon to Florida!
My current canning obsession is using oranges from our tree to make marmalade. Also using our Ball Jars for making lots of fermented pickles. Jars are everywhere in our house!
I made this pesto with my very dear friend (like a daughter to me) while visiting her at her home in Austin, Texas. It was the first time for me (and her too, I think) making pesto. It turned out great!!!
Cranberry Port Conserve. Delicious.
Here are some peppers that we canned! They are so pretty and are wonderful on homemade pizzas, and pasta dishes! I took this picture right before I poured the pickled solution in them! Yum!
Here are just a few of the things my family canned this year (tomatoes, dill pickles and dilly beans). I LOVE how pretty they look all put up on the shelves :)
Yummy peach chutney I made this year.
Dill pickled Cauliflower and Green Beans. I saw dilled green beans in a store and thought my husband would love them. Unfortunately they were full of sugar and my husband hated them. So I said to myself, how hard can it be? I'm sure if I find some decent directions I can do this myself right? Well I am the talk of the family now! :) My pickles are highly sought after commodities. I only wish I had seen the canning discovery kit , would have made my first attempt go a lot smoother :)
Its National Chocolate Cake Day! Make the holiday even sweeter with this Chocolate Cake in a Jar recipe. Simply layer ingredients into your favorite Ball jar and let them eat cake! http://bit.ly/grvafs
Cider jelly on the left and French Vanilla pickles on the right! Both delish. (:
Of all the pictures I have of the many recipes I've canned I think this one is best showing the various sizes of "Ball" and how yummy everything looks. Carrot Cake Jam, savory Bruchetta, and my succulent Quince preserves. Thanks Ball!
A trio that I made using a large stockpot and a veggie steamer: Moyer's chutney (green tomato and pear for Christmas gifts), peach jam with ginger and vanilla, and vidalia pissaladiere topping from the summer.
Not the greatest photo, but the best of our canning last year. We just canned plain strawberries with a little bit of sugar. Delicious, especially when heated up with a little bit of cornstarch to make a sauce or syrup for waffles and ice cream!
These were some of my Christmas gifts for family and friends. Chunky Applesauce, Blueberry Jam and Pomegranate Jelly.
Yummy mango rhubarb jelly, raspberry jam and orange spice jelly...such lovely colors and all in Ball Canning Jars!
This was my first year making and canning my own pasta sauce...and it won't be the last!
Blackberry Jam
Strawberry Jam and Strawberry Rhubarb Jam alongside my beloved peonys and roses!
Cranberry orange butter! I recently learned how to can and can't figure out why I was so intimidated by canning for years. I love the color and the tangy flavor of this fruit butter. The "Ball Complete Guide to Home Preserving" has become my canning bible.
New to canning. Last weekend I made apple butter and this past weekend I made blueberry and strawberry preserves. All canned in Ball jars : )
sweet-hot pepper rings @ http://www.put-a-lid-on-it.blogspot.com/
Fall Harvest; tomatoes, jalapenos and salsa!
Just wondering if theres any fellow Canadians who grow Jerusalem Artichokes that would be willing to share a few?
The Ball jars are a charming way to serve fresh veggies to kids! Got the idea from a local restaurant, and now use it at home. Somehow, more of them go down the hatch when they are served this way!
I have a question.... I made some homemade bean soup with leftover ham from Christmas dinner. I have no room in my freezer for the leftovers. Can I can the extra soup? If so, any suggestions or recipes to do so would be appreciated. I hate to throw food out and I know I will not be able to eat it all. Thank you in advance for your help. 
Does anyone have experience with pressure canning pinto beans? If so- please share with me. I want to can up some to have on hand when I need them. Thanks!
Hello, I have become interested in learning how to can, I do not have any equipment yet, I would like to start off by canning vegetables, maybe string beans or peas to start, Can a stock pot be used or is a pressure canner always used? any info is appeciated..
Can I turn any of the jam recipes into no-cook freezer recipes? I don't feel confident enough yet to start water baths or pressure cooking.
My grandma always canned and dehydrated fruits and veggies and I always wanted to learn how. I received a canning kit for xmas and am so excited to get started! 
RECIPE: looking for a Plum Sauce recipe for freezer method? Got about 3 large freezer bags of sliced plums...
Salsa, pickled jalapenos and cowboy candy ready to share with family at Christmas. The cowboy candy was a huge hit!
is sad...I have no pictures to share because I gave away all of my canning equipment a few years ago when I had to move and had nowhere for a garden..I am now back in the country and wanting to start canning again so I REEEEEEALLLY NEEEEED to win this contest so I can post pretty pictures like these wonderful canners who use Ball already...pooooor me :'(
has anyone had any luck with cranberry mustard??? the recipe I have used is just not working and I would love to make some...I have 20 lb of frozen cranberries to use.......
Homegrown beets straight from my garden to the jar. Pickled beets from the Ball Blue Book recipe...and they are really really good.
I just <3 looking at everyone's pictures- we are a great group of 'putter-uppers'
good luck everyone...i just viewed all the pixs...awesome job...dreaming of what to process this summer!!! thanks for all the wonderful ideas...yummy pixs
Pressure canned chicken (first try!), well-loved pomegranate jelly and pears. It's so satisfying to see all the jars lined up on my kitchen table.
I'm new at canning and going to can soup today. :)
Does anyone have a recipe for canning/pressure canning tomato soup?
Does anyone have a BBQ sauce for canning...ie plums, pineapple, peaches, pears or apples
 's her canning jars...still messing with them...lol...today reorganized and put spices and dry goods into jars (throw out the plastic...) ...got the idea after viewing all the wonderful pixs 
 Lisa Randall Guillette's thread regarding her pantry reminded me of a class I teach through community ed in the early Spring called Preparing to Preserve. If you are an experienced food preserver, you might want to consider teaching something similar. I bring all my food preservation equipment and resources to class - freezing, dehydrating, canning, vaccuum sealers, and resources like books and websites - and we have a conversation about what works and what might not work so well. Folks are very interested and you have a lot to share with those less experienced.
my first attempt at jelly....and it rocks! I used my grandmothers really old ball, mason and atlas mason jars. I am loving this new hobby I have begun.
Using my pressure canner for the first time. Made a big batch of venison chili. Still can't believe this works. So I can really just throw this on a shelf when I'm done?
Is anyone else having trouble seeing the recipes in the recipe archive? I keep seeing a little note that says the archive will be down momentarily for updates but it's been saying that for almost 2 weeks.
When looking at my latest "country" magazine they had a few recipes for a bread and cake that you canned?? I am a newbie to the canning process and wondered if this is safe and if anyone has done this before. I wouldn't think the canning jars could handle the temperature of a stove?? Thanks!!
I have two questions: I've got some great oranges to make marmalade. I also have some wonderful apricots left over from the summer's bounty. I'm thinking of adding some apricot juice to my marmalade. To everyone: Do you think those two tastes would go together? To seasoned canners: Do you think the apricot juice combined with the oranges will cause each other problems setting up?
I've done a lot of the Freezer recipes from the Ball websites. I'm looking for a some "interesting" jams. Something more than single berry jams. Lots of spices preferred. Thanks.
I just reads about someone canning bananas? I've never heard of this before- is it safe?
If anyone has been wanting to get a pressure canner, I was in my local WAL-MART today and they had quite a few marked down to $58.00 on clearance...That is a fabulous price if you have been pricing them!!!
I am very new at canning and I know nothing about making jams but I want to learn! I have a question for all you seasoned canners out there: My husband is diabetic and I want to make Homemade Strawberry Jam without Splenda or any other type of sugar substitute. Can I make my own strawberry jam with homemade pectin? I have seen a few recipes on the web that calls for granny smith apples to use for the pectin, however, would this make the jam taste like apples? Any advice would be great! Thank you!
A friend and I made two and a half cases of apple-ginger jam today for a fundraiser. My back is killing me!
read on another page that you won't be making the smaller jars (like half pints) anymore? Please say it isn't so. I love to use these for my jams and jellies and several other items that only I will / can eat because of diet restrictions. I also like using them for foods that my family does not eat frequently so I do not end up throwing food out. 
Does anyone have a Banana Butter recipe they would like to share please.. :)
Question I would like to can the following teriyaki mairnade. Does anyone know what pounds and time to pressure can at? I was thinking 10 lb for 15 minute for pints and 10 lb 25 minute for quart. I plan on only doing pints. Or could I water bath for the same amount of time? Teriyaki marinade 1 c packed brown sugar 2/3 c ketchup 2/3 c vinegar 1/2 c soy sauce (I'm using reduced sodium) 5 - 6 cloves garlic finely chopped 2 tsp ground ginger Mix ingredients in medium bowl Marinate chicken or chops * recipe courtesy of "Best Name Brand Recipe Book"
Not just for jam and pickles! Just opened a jar of vanilla sugar and the scent is a delight. 1/2 a scraped vanilla bean (used the seeds for custard) and 1 1/2 cups sugar. Great for baking.
Im canning salsa for the first time...any suggestions ??
I'm looking for the recipe for canning pickled fish from an old Ball canning cookbook. Not sure if it's from the Blue book or something else. Does anyone have that recipe, by chance??
I've got a great recipe for cucumber salsa and a huge harvest of cucumbers (I live in Australia) - can it be canned successfully? I cannot find a cucumber salsa recipe amongst your recipes. Its a 'non-cook' version which contains 2 cucumbers, 2 tomatoes, 1 bell pepper, 3 chillis, 1 onion, 1 clove garlic, 2 tablespoons lime juice, parsley, cilantro, dill and salt. You just combine everything with salt to taste and refrigerate for minumum of 1 hour. 
I've found the freezer pectin and I've found no-sugar added pectin, but does Ball make a no-sugar or low sugar freezer pectin?
I've got some leftover chicken soup that i want to can using my pressure cooker/canner but not sure how. Any suggestions? I know about filling the jars but not sure about the pressure canner part. I have a T_Fal Sensor 2.
Tomato sauce from our local Shenandoah Valley tomatoes. Best I've ever made...or had!
Another reason to love canning! Mixing a bit of one of my many homemade jams w Greek yogurt for breakfast with a taste of summer. Today is apricot, yesterday strawberry...
I just made the Ball Fiesta Salsa Mix. After processing I'm noticing there are some air pockets. Still waiting for them to cool and have the lids sink in. What should I do?
had a busy day yesterday....at suppertime I just opened two pint jars of moosemeat, heated it up, added bbq sauce and we had bbq sandwiches for dinner! It was so tender and savory and it only took minutes to prepare! I love the convenience that canning brings to the table!!!!
I just received the canning pot in the mail- it is gorgeous! Even my teenage daughter commented- "Wow- that's a really nice pot!" thanks again, I can't remember the last time I won anything, I think I was 9. It will definately get put to good use!
Home canned peaches 2010
Wild plum jelly, apple butter and pumpkin butter, mostly to give away for Christmas :) Forgot the mulberry/plum jelly on the end, oops!
Pickled jalapenos, a little hot but sooooo good.
Dehydrated parsley, jalapenos, and red bell peppers are just a few of the many dehydrated and home canned items that we use Ball canning jars for. We also store our pastas, legumes, and baking staples (i.e. sugar, baking powder, etc.) in them too.
We love Ball jars here in Loudoun County Virginia! Va Cooperative Extension, Faith based Community leaders at Giant Food providing a community canning lessons.
This was my first attempt at Jams. This is blackberry, but I have made tripleberry, strawberry and Peach. Love them all! I am just hooked on canning now.
Using old jars and new jars. Rumtopf, lemoncello liqueur, cranberry liqueur, Orange liqueur, cranberry/orange liqueur...and we dont even DRINK! :) but they sure look pretty :) Oh plus almond extract and cinnamon extract...
Besides tomatoes, jams, and various fruits from my garden, my canning jars also include an unfinished sock monkey!
Just a small sampling of my Ball Canning (most using recipes from the Ball Blue Book): Garlic Dill Pickles, Salsa, Pickled Green Cherry Tomatoes, Tomato Sauce, Green Tomato Relish, Huckleberry-Lime Jam and Pickled Okra.
Tomatoes, salsa, blueberries and cherry/almond jam :)
I'm choosing to post a pic of the blackberry jam I canned this past year because it was my first attempt EVER to can. I'm proud to say my efforts were successful and delicious! I also went on to can tomatoes, tomato juice, pickles and hot pepper sauce. The canned jars look so beautiful.
We use Ball canning jars for our hand poured scented candles and apple butter that we sell through our business. We also use them for all of our canning needs. I have tried other jars and lids and we lost of half of what we canned, so now I stay strictly with Ball.
A favorite at our house is Apple pie filling. I can have a nice hot apple pie on the table now nothing flat. The grand daughter prefers my home made apple sauce though.
Pickled beets! I'm just waiting to harvest the next crop from my garden I sure could use that canner and book!
Here is my Husband and I's first attempt a Spaghetti Sauce!
Our pears for the year.
This is my second year canning. I wonder how we ever managed before without home canned food. It just tastes so much better!
I just couldn't put all my goodies in our basement cellar so I gave up a corner to put a variety of the 30+ different things I canned this year including pickles, beets, beans, celery, squash, soup, jams, hot peppers and just this week 47 lbs of onions......I even use the blue older jars as a centerpiece on my table......
I canned 30 pounds of tomatoes this summer. I made a smokey tomato bisque over GF sweet potato Gnocchi. I also canned apple chutney, salsa, peach jam, dilly pickles, applesauce, roasted pepper ketchup and Chinese Plum Sauce. I love Ball!
My brother Ron and I put up 436 quarts of dill pickles this year. Ron has a system for measuring the amount of pucker power. A jar with a number one is only half full of dill. For a number 10, I have to use a 2" wooden dowel to mash the dill down far enough to get any pickles in the jar. I had one today and it took 30 minutes to get my eyes back open. We are very happy with the Ball products. Not one broken jar and not one that did not seal.
This is my first season of canning and I love it! One of my creations this fall: Onion Apple Ale relish. Delicious with cheese!
Always a Thanksgiving dinner tradition in my family, I now make and can my own spiced apple rings with fresh locally grown apples and no funky fake colors. And they're a huge hit! Thanks Ball for the wonderful recipe.
I haven't purchased commercial Tomato Sauce in 3 years!
Anything apple...apple sauce, apple juice, apple pie filling!
Fresh Colorado Peaches in the morning sunshine. This was my first season of canning about everything I could get my hands on. What a great thing to learn!
Candy Apple Jelly!
glazed carrots. Yum!
One of my Favorites...Green Tomato Raspberry Jam. It's a great way to use up all your green tomatoes at the end of harvest season.
One of my first projects....applesauce
Award winning indian spiced pickled cauliflower, caramelized pear jam and some pear butter. All in a weekends work sometime this fall.
I use Ball jars for everything! I give gifts of food, mixes, beauty supplies. This past summer I scored a BUNCH of the old zinc lids. I cleaned and sterilized them to use on the top of a 4 oz Quilted Jelly Jar for my gifts of Vanilla Brown Sugar Scrubs to the ladies on my Christmas list. Attached the tag with some jute twine...oh so cute!
In addition to canning like crazy, I also use the jars for SPROUTING during the cold Alaska winter so that I can have fresh "veggies". I call it my indoor garden :)
This is some of my grape juice I canned this fall. My neighbor gave us the grapes. I ended up with 44 quarts of grape juice!
Canning veggies from the garden...and some from an abundance of another gardener...Love the green beans and carrots that we get to enjoy thru the winter!
My first canning! Applesauce and apple jelly!
Sweet Pumpkin Pickles...yummy!
We had a lot of peaches this summer. I canned slices in apple juice and used the Spreadable Fieldberries Spicy Peaches recipe to make a spread similar to jam without sugar. Yum :)
Sugar spiced nuts for holiday gifts...
1/2 gallons of peppers and pickles!
My cousin and I have just recently gotten into canning, and we love it! Our bounty for this day was Apple Butter, Pumpkin Butter, Cranberry Ginger Jam, and Apricot Jalapeno Jelly! I love the Apple Butter so much, I refuse to buy it in the stores now!
Concord Grape Jelly, Kiwi Jam, Zesty Salsa, Candy Apple Jelly, & Hot Chocolate Mix We gave these all as gifts and they were all decorated, but most of the decorated jars were already given away before I took a picture of them.

What's left in the pantry from the summer is pickled jalapenos, tomatoes with green chilies, strawberry jam, apple pie jam, spiced peaches, spiced peach jam, and a few jars of dill pickles.
Peppers are so versitile, Jelly, pickled sweets (spiced up with jalokias), and my favorite enchalada sauce.
This is my first season canning! I made delicious tomato sauce. Now, I'm hooked!
I tried canning for the first time this year. My supplies are limited, but I borrowed to begin with from friends and have slowly been getting a few of my own and got a few more for Christmas. I read canning book recipes in the evening. It is wonderful. I love to hear the pop of sealing cans. This picture is from my blog where I posted more about my excitement during the year. Christmas eve our family trades "favorite things" what is your most favorite thing from the year. I handed out jars of goodies and there was lots of trading and fun to get the ones everyone wanted. I had many kinds. Thank you to the ball products. I love to see the jars and share them with friends. A new hobby I plan to continue.
My first try at salsa. All my coworkers and family loved it. Can't wait to make more.
Apple jelly. It took first place at our fair. One great jelly.
If I have to pick just one, it's this shot of Golden Nectar Juice from the latest Ball Blue Book. Summer in a jar.
Apple Pomegranate Jelly--so pretty! I hope I win!
Jalapeno Orange Cardamom jelly -- great on cream cheese as a dip!
Apple jelly from our apples.
My peach jam, that everyone loves and keeps wanting more of! This is the second year I have canned and I love it! Last year I canned veggie soup and jam, this year just jam because I was so busy. I also put cookie ingredients in quart jars and give as Christmas presents. So cute and affordable and people love them!
Old fashioned mustard pickles.....these are tangy yet sweet with plenty of vegetables and antioxidants.....
We enjoyed this story on a canning swap event and just had to share! 
Brrrr, it's cold out there! We're curious what are your favorite cold weather soups? Let us know by voting in our latest poll: http://on.fb.me/dGw4Eq
2010 Canning season yielded Purple Hull Peas, Pickled Squash, Green Beans, and my grandmas Bread & Butter Pickles. Some of these jars are from my grandma's stash of jars I love ball jars.
Grape jelly & katchup....this picture doesn't even have all the spaghetti sauce we made we made that day.
yummy red raspberry jam from my moms garden... she froze the berries in the summer... I made jam in January ....our favrite !!!
wanted to use some of the summer blackberries and some of the winter cranberries..what a great blend in this jam..and Ive never decorated jars before and did this on a whim for Valentines day gifts..any ideas on decorating???
Sugar free Strawberry Jam, Strawberry Jam, Peach Jam, and Candy Apple Jelly
Pints and quarts of beef roast, pints of chicken breast and pork loin, and a couple pints of "gumbo mix"!
Cinnamon Pickles. An old family recipe from my husbands side of the family. It is a recipe that involves 4 days of work before they can even go in the jar. VERY YUMMY! Never heard of them until I met him. Our 11 month old LOVES THEM.
My 2nd attempt at making the Cranberry Pineapple Freezer Jam. This time with the Ball Elite 8oz jars. They won't be going in the freezer because the pkg doesn't say they're ok in the freezer. Are there any 8oz glass jars that are good for freezer jam?
This is a pic of my Cherry Syrup, Ginger Peach Pineapple Fruit Butter, and Chinese 5 Spice Pickled Cherries from the summer!
taste of summer...pear chutney
The aftermath of 25 pounds of pickling cucumbers (garlic dill spears, sweet relish, dill slices, etc.)
Pickled jalapenos. From our garden and waiting to go on our tacos. :)
Salsa from my garden
Applesauce & apple butter--my first canning project!
The last two jars of my spicy cauliflower mustard pickles. I made a dozen at the end of the Arlington MA farmers market season! Thai chili pepper look so pretty and petite but pack a spicy punch.
Low-sugar kiwi jam. :)
No Ball jar goes to waste in my house! I'm still canning now in January. Here's a pic of my 2010 canned goodies. Apple sauce, pickles, squash, potatoes, green beans, pork and beans, tomato sauce and more. Any chipped jars get used for dehydrated items.....carrots, celery, onions and peppers so far.
Here is a jar from the DIXIE Classic Fair, Winston-Salem NC, where I won 1st place, Judges Choice, and the Ball Award!
Blackberry Grand Marnier Jam - Yummy!!
Herb jelly, white zinfandel jelly, Sicilian marinara sauce, end of garden pickles, and apples (all in one night!)

Yummy and quick! Edamame is our choice for this week's Eating the Alphabet. Does your family like edamame? What's your favorite way to enjoy it?
Here's a round-up of some of the weblinks I've posted here over the last couple of weeks and a couple of new ones to check out like the Healthy Month game with a team sponsored by Eating Rules. Oh! And don't forget to vote in the poll on the blog for input about what you want to read more about this year!
We just got back from vacation and I realized that a meal planning for vacation post is definitely needed. Maybe a series for traveling with just your own family, vacationing with other friends and families and traveling by plane or car...lots to think about. What do you do when you go on vacation to keep eating balanced meals in check? Or is it your time to splurge on things you don't normally eat?
New survey up on the blog and a rundown of the meal planning services review I'll be doing...take a mnute and give me your feedback on both. 2011 is gonna be GREAT! Thanks!
Came across this great article about superfoods for our bodies. My family will eat 8 out of the 10..still working on broccoli and black beans (I like them though!) Be sure to scroll all the way to the bottom for links to LOTS of recipes featuring these foods. Yum!
New menu plan is up! And my mini-review on the Whole Wheat Powdered Donuts and a couple of other recipes. What does your meal plan look like this week?
Interesting story about how Americans shop for food. Of course it's much more complex than this but just reminds us that we must continually educate ourselves about what is good food for our bodies.
Just spent a good chunk of time exploring this blog after hearing the author on satellite radio this afternoon. Good reads for sure and a further reason to meal plan! :-) 
Today's Challenge - Spread the word about Liam and his valiant fight against cancer to everyone you know. By the end of the day we want to see the Cookies for Kids' Cancer community grow from to 50,000. This brave little boy, who was the inspiration for his mom to start the charity, lost his battle with the disease earlier this week. 
Another article on food trends...some of them a little exotic for us home cooks IMO (well, it is the National Restaurant Assoc. that came out with this list) but some of them right up my alley like fruit & vegetables as children's side items, simplicity/back to basics and children's nutrition.
Interestingly eating more vegetables are already on our resolution list! Does that make me trendy? Add the pie and I'll really be on board! :-)
A wrap-up of some of this week's web links that I've posted here and a few new ones about Girl Scout Cookies and bananas..two of my favorites!
Overheard in the elevator yesterday...."You know, I always hope to get so much done when I get home from work but it never seems to happen." "Yeah, by the time I figure out what's for dinner and get it made I'm too tired to do much of anything else. I have figured out you need to plan your meals ahead of time. I just need to do that more." I just smiled. People are getting it, now let's just do it! :-)
Talking about my busy life in a conversation with my grandmother, "I don't have time to go grocery shopping. That's why I go every day." Meaning... I don't have time to plan meals so I'm always popping into the store (or sending hubby) so we can find something quick to fix - just to get by.

MEAT SAWWWWWWWWWWWCE
Yo, Epic Meal Time! You guys need to checkout Martin Berkan, the Cheesecake Master, and come up with something together. You both have a lot of mutual fans, so I know the response would be stellar. Anyways, just an idea. Keep doing what you're doing. Cheers.

You guys will win the shorty and deservedly so. I hate to sound negative, but you may want to 1. stop buying shit at drive thrus/in convenience stores (use the culinary skills we all know you have), 2. keep pushing for something even more epic (you don't see the Jackass guys getting tamer every episode/movie do you) and 3. bacon strips bacon strips bacon strips. If it isn't broken, don't fix it. Egg roll? Please....and the dessert...I mean it was store bought...chicks were hot, though, 4. Jack Daniel's. Scared you guys are going to fall apart and disappear before you all have heart attacks.

I have an idea for you guys...you don't seem to get enough veggies in your diets, so I think you should make an EPIC salad. Make a bowl out of ground beef, and fill it with a mix of dead animals and deep fried vegetables, including deep fried lettuce, covered in either beer batter, tempura batter, or chip crumbs. Or, for an epic maneuvre, batter it in all three. Finish it off with pork rinds, cheddar cheese, french toast croutons, and Jack Daniels salad dressing. And on top of that, bacon strips, bacon strips, bacon strips, and candied bacon strips,. What do you think?

i fucking love you guys- your fucking epiccccc- come to california and get epic with in and out burger- keep doing big things......with bacon
i love watching how awesome you are every tuesday! and guess what, you're just as awesome on mondays!!!
"baconstrips" tshirts please!
There is a burrito place by me that offers jalapeno bacon. You guys should come to New Jersey, and use some of it in your videos. 
It's cool that you guys just like protein and baconators so much. I just find that you waste flavors like hell. I feel like one meat, say pork, glassed in Dr. Pepper and butter tastes better than 7 already cooked layers of bacon and chicken stuffed into the pig. The salt just kills most of the flavors and you're just tasting non-specific animal grease with sugar and bacon salt. Still, big fan... Keep it up.
you guys need more bacon and more jack daniels, next time get two magnums and 20 lbs of bacon
I really want that "Bacon Strips & Bacon Strips..." shirt. Oh my goodness, you guys are the best, been following you since TurBaconEpic, props from Edmonton! 
hey guys, its my housemate's birthday in a couple of weeks - do you reckon you could help me out with some kind of meat cake recipe? much appreciation from the UK!
It's my birthday today... I'm gonna deep-fry this big birthday bitch with beer batter. 
 During his battle with gluttony King Cathal mac Finguine had a vision of a land made entirely of food (from Wikipedia): The fort we reached was beautiful, With works of custards thick, Beyond the loch. New butter was the bridge in front, The rubble dyke was wheaten white, Bacon the palisade. Stately, pleasantly it sat, A compact house and strong. Then I went in: The door of it was dry meat, The threshold was bare bread, cheese-curds the sides. Smooth pillars of old cheese, And sappy bacon props Alternate ranged; Fine beams of mellow cream, White rafters real curds, Kept up the house.
Hey do you guys sell t-shirts? I NEED that Bacon strips one
Hi from Wales, where can I get an Epic Meal Time t-shirt ??
Guys, you have officially surpassed Bret Hart as my favorite Canadiens. i wanna be in one of your videos so f(sqwaaawww) badly... im a master of creating epic burgers... but i think that i need some EMT emergency help to put it over the edge. Its safe to say you guys are due for an EPIC BURGER TIME. time to get SMART.
you guys need to make some t-shirts, based off the last video with the "bacon strips and bacon strips and bacon strips......" shirt, r they in the works???
Obligatory "You Should Make..." comment. But seriously, epic seafood meal, catch a great white shark, and cover it in bacon.

Hey This is some funny shit.. got a question on the breakfast of booze episode what went into you bear batter and jack syrup? 
Yo, shoot me a message or comment back with a link to buy an epic meal time shirt. Saw it in the new vid and want to rock one at work.
You know what....If you haven't watch the documentary movie called Fat Head, what you guys are making would actually be more healthier than what we usually eat..like bread, cereals, and other sugary shiznets. Don't worry about the cholesterol and keep going! 
Just got an advert on the Meatball Deathstar video.... not even angry, just sad :( DONT SELL OUT!!
THIS IS EPIC MEAL TIME WE DEEP FRIED IT COVERED IT IN MELTED CHEESE AND TONS OF SMOKED MEAT.......MORE BACON!!!!
It's Tuesday, but there's no new Epic Meal with extra bacon on a side of bacon with bacon bits and Jack Daniels sauce. My life is empty now . . . 
you guys put foodporndaily.com to shame. ohh, and you should make a pit stop in Blairstown Nj if your still in the city!!!!
I pledge allegiance to Epic Mealtime and their next level cooking moves, and to the Meat sweats which it causes, one nation under Haters, indivisible, with Meat Glue and Bacon for all.
I was wondering if the EPICMEALTIME tshirts seen in the videos are available so some of us can represent the BADASSES OF BACON?

Epic Deep fried Hollandaise! = 1l Clarified butter, 18 egg yolks, 20 sheets gelatin (bloomed in warm water) placed it in the refrigerator, un-molded it, breaded it and deep fried it to gooey bliss. You can replace clarified butter with rendered fioe gras fat. Epic Confit potato! = 1 L bacon fat or duck fat or clarified butter, Add lardons of double smoked bacon to the fat heat the fat. Peel potato's cut evenly cook until tender, cool them, wrap them in bacon and deep fry. 
Hey! Do you guys deliver????

Holy mother of god! You guys are brilliant!!!!!!! 
So, I'm craving a Double layer Deep fried Meat-Lovers pizza (with Baconators, French Fries, Velveeta cheese, and peppers (habaneros) stuffed inside the two layers), covered and padded in ground Angus beef and bacon strips. Then covered in bacon bit-dark chocolate and deep fried again in Jack Daniels Bacon grease. Again, I don't know why I am craving this, but I am. Perhaps a possible idea? lol. 
WHAT DO YALL KNOW ABOUT BLACK METAL AND THE INGESTATION OF MASS QUANTITIES OF MEAT?! OR THE IMPALEMENT OF PIG HEADS ON STAGE TO DEMONSTRATE OUR MASTERY OVER THE PORK RACE?!

For your next video, you guys should either make a really awesome cheeseburger (with bacon of course), another dessert episode and make an insane sundae, or something pertaining to buffalo wings or something along those lines. Hell yes.
I watched your videos on your channel. All of them. Now, unless it looks like it's deep fried and covered with BACON, I can't eat anything and walk away with satisfaction. Well done, gentlemen. Well done.

I went to my local supermarket last night. Had craving for bacon. ALL bacon was sold out. :( Even the sad excuse for low-cost watered-down smokeflavour-infused crap that they dare call bacon. Not a single pack left. I bet bacon-sales worldwide has skyrocketed since you guys started this.
"Only in their wildest fantasies of meat had so many animals been slaughtered to be enjoyed in so many ways!!!" "And Cheese....."

This is an excellent explanation of how the body reacts to refined sugars. If you haven't already, dump the white stuff.
Thanks Karen Roth for shining a spotlight on the incredible edible egg! Also, thanks for sharing one of my favorite recipes from my book One Bite at a Time. Cook Note: Organic eggs please or the best -- eggs from your friend's chickens!

This is the perfect time of year to be eating ginger. In addition to being anti-inflammatory, it's also anti-bacterial. So whether you're feeling a case of the sniffles or sore from a work out, drink some ginger tea.

Wonderful! I crave cake! At my age, it's a challenge to lose weight and have such a craving! This is excellent news, but I do have a question. The video shows adding 3 whole eggs and vegetable oil to the sugar free cake mix. Can you substitute applesauce or mashed banana for some of the oil and can you use egg beaters or just the egg whites?
my husband had to give up sweets when he found out he was diabetic. he is so thrilled with these products. the fudge brownies are his favorite! thank you for these products!!!!
yesterday I found the sugar free brownie mix at our local Kroger store and made it for supper and I must say it was VERY GOOD, every bit as good as the s/f chocolate cake/s/f frosting. I mixed in some crushed s/f chocolate covered peanuts. It is hard to tell its sugar free, goes good with carbsmart ice cream, now I need to try the s/f yellow cake mix. I am going to make it for the next meeting I go to that is potluck, no one will know the difference if I don't tell them

Good, Better, Best, and never let it rest - until your Good is Better and your Better Best. When I was younger and in Jr. High (now called middle school), my favorite teacher used to say this all the time. It has stuck in my mind since (and that's a long time ago)! Just ask my grown children.
Comfort Food - Stuffed Bell Peppers! This is one of my husband's favorite dishes. I think it reminds him of food his mother used to make. Made this dish last night for dinner.
Arpege Eggs - I want to share with you this fantastic egg recipe. I made it for a dinner party and everyone was delighted! It takes a little more effort to make, but well worth it.
Inside-Out German Chocolate Cake - a cake to forget your diet with - so decadent!
Prosciutto-Stuffed Meatloaf Tonight I tested a recipe for an upcoming dinner party. This meatloaf is absolutely heavenly! My husband loved it. It is a little more time consuming that regular old-fashion meatloaf, but well worth the time. You be the judge!
If you love lemons - you'll love this Roasted Lemon Salsa with its sweet-sour taste. How about sharing your unusual salsa recipes?
Comfort food night - Made a pot of my favorite stew, Boeuf Bourguignon. So good!
Baked Potatoes and Eggs. Made this for dinner last night. I hadn't made this for years, but was inspired by Cathy and her blog, Wives with Knifes, to remake it with some bacon added. Here is Cathy's blog: http://thewiveswithknives.blogspot.com/
Our family's traditional Monday Night Football Nachos. Perfect for watching the big game tonight. GO DUCKS! Yes, I'm a University of Oregon fan! My son played middle line backer for the team in the 80s. I know that dates me - but it is what it is!
You can be thin and wrinkly, or you can have another bowl of banana pudding and fluff that stuff out!

Homemade Beef Jerky - This fantastic beef jerky recipe and photos was shared with me by my sister-in-law, Shirley Roth. She especially made this batch for my husband, Don, as he loves her beef jerky and begs for it!
I have a question about the cinnamon roll recipe. It says if you put them in the fridge the night before you bake them it's not necessary to let them rise. Then the next step says to preheat the oven and let the rolls rise til doubled in size. Which one or both do I do?
Did you know - Super Bowl Sunday is the biggest day of the year for snack food consumption. Americans hold more parties in their homes on Super Bowl Game day than on any other day of the year (even surpassing New Year's Eve). More food is consumed than on any single day of the year except Thanksgiving. What are you serving for your Super Bowl party?

We have been using Nutri Source Lamb & Rice since we adopted our Golden Retriever Ginni from RAGOM (Retrieve A Golden of Minnesota) 3 years ago. One year ago we started foster dogs with RAGOM and only use Nutri Source! Nutri Source gets an A+ rating with RAGOM! This little guy in the picture is one of our current foster dogs :) We currently have 8 dogs (4 are ours) so we go through quite a bit of Nutri Source! Every other week I am buying big bags of it! Thanks for making such a wonderful product!
Just wanted to say Thank you so much for the Free bag of NutriSource Grain Free Chicken formula. For winning the contest , It was delivered today to my door !!
Hi there, I've been feeding my 2 persian cats with your Pure Vita dry cat food.It is a perfect cat food with marvellous ingredients and my both cats love it very much. I noticed that your new produced cat foods I mean which have the expiration date Dec 2011, are different. They have a darker color and smaller shaped also thay have some crumbs on them. I have bought 4 packages with Dec 2011 expiration date and I checked all of them are the same..But my cats are eating without a problem. I just wonder what is changed in your Pure Vita cat food? Why is the color darker and the kibbles are smaller? Thanks for producing this great cat food :)

My puppy is 5 months old now. A boston terrier and he loves to eat his poop. I have him on extra vitamins from gnc as well as your nutrisource puppy chow. anything I can do to deter or make him stop. I just recent got the gnc poop no more pills and give him one a day. is this a nutrional thingy or just the way some puppies are?
Question for you guys there at NutriSource. Is there any frequent buyers program for those of us that buy online? I live about 175mi from the nearest location that sells NutriSource so i buy online. Just wondering thanks guys! :)
I would like to know the reason for the chicken Grain Free appears shiny.
I am wondering if someone can direct me to the person I can talk to about the possibilty of getting dog food donations once in awhile. I am wondering if once in awhile a bag may break open or something like that and you would then not be able to sell it. Right now I am foster dogs for RAGOM frequently, and sometimes others. And there are always more dogs coming in all the time. Right now I buy a 33lb bag of NutriSource Lamb & Rice every week to 1.5 weeks. So that can be a lot at times! :) I like to feed the Lamb & Rice as we just don't know if a foster dog may have an allergy to something. I really LOVE fostering and I love NutriSource!! And I am happy to support my community here in Perham. Just wondering if it would be possible to come and meet with a group or someone in general that I could talk to. Even getting 1-2 bags a month or 1.5 months would help. I thank you for your time and hope to hear from someone soon. Thanks!
I got to meet two wonderful NutriSource reps @ Pheasant Fest this last weekend! THey were so excited to hear of a Nebraskan who has used their product for almost 7 years, after meeting my 6.5 year old Wiemaraner, they were convinced, YES she is a true NutriSource girl! Thanks NutriSource for great food!

slt,n7eb recette croissant au beurre et merci d'avant...
Pour la pte (qui sert aussi de pte a croissant) : 250g farine type 45 1 sachet de levure briochin 90 gr de beurre extra fin 30g de sucre 137,5 g ou 137,5 ml d'eau tide 6g de sel 1 jaune d'oeuf + un peu de lait, pour la dorure environ 150g de chocolat (j'ai utilis de la Pralinoise) Dans un saladier : mlanger la farine + le sel, puis ajouter le sucre, la levure, faire un puit et ajouter l'eau tide. Ptrir jusqu' l'obtention d'une pte souple et lisse. Faire une boule et laisser reposer dans le saladier en couvrant avec un linge tide humide au frigo pendant 30 minutes. Au bout de 30 minutes, retravailler la pate pour en chasser l'air, et de nouveau laisser reposer au frigo pendant 1 heure, toujours avec le linge humide. En attendant, aplatir le beurre en forme de carr (mettre dans un sac en plastique de congelation avant de l'applatir au rouleau) et remettre le tout au frigo. Au bout de l'heure de repos, taler la pate en un carr et disposer le beurre au milieu (mais le beurre en forme de carr ne doit pas etre parallele au bord de la pate). En fait, la pate face vous, doit reprsenter un losange et le beurre un carr. Rabattre les quatre coins de la pate sur le beurre et etaler. Etaler la pate en un grand rectangle et plier la en trois (dans le sens de la longueur, ca va de soit) et faire un quart de tour. Laisser reposer 30 minutes au frigo. Ensuite, retaler la pate en ayant la pliure sur la droite, pour former de nouveau un grand rectangle. Plier la en trois et faire un quart de tour. Laisser encore reposer 30 minutes au frigo. Etaler la pate en un grand rectangle et dcouper des longs rectangles de 6x16cm. Dans chaque rectangle, disposer deux morceaux de Pralinoise et enrouler la pate tout autour. Dorer les petits pains de jaune d'oeuf mlang un peu de lait. Laisser gonfler un moment et mettre au four thermostat 7 pendant 10-15 minutes Bon petits pains !!!
Ingrdients : - 8 grosses tranches de pain crot italien - 8 tranches de poitrine de dinde cuite - 375 ml de poivrons rouges grills, goutts et tranchs en lanires - 50 ml (1/4 tasse) d'olives noires haches - 4 6 tranches de fromage provolone ou mozzarella - 50 ml (1/4 tasse) de sauce salade Italienne ou Ranch crmeuse Prparation : 1. Sur chacune des 4 tranches de pain, dposer 2 tranches de poitrine, 2 3 lanires de poivrons, 30 ml (2 c. soupe) d'olives et 60 g (2 oz) de fromage. 2. tendre la sauce salade sur les 4 autres tranches de pain puis dposer celles-ci (sauce l'intrieur) sur chacune des tranches recouvertes d'ingrdients. 3. Badigeonner l'extrieur du pain d'huile d'olive. 4. Chauffer un grand polon sur feu moyen. Y dposer les sandwiches et laisser griller jusqu' ce que le pain soit dor, environ 4 minutes. Tourner et faire griller l'autre ct.
500g de semoule fine 200g de farine 1/2 cs de sel 1 cs de levure de boulanger Eau Huile de friture Dans un grand saladier mettre la semoule et la farine tamise. Faire un puits et ajouter le sel. Ajouter la levure de boulanger dlaye dans 3 cs d'eau tide. Arroser d'eau tide au fur et mesure du ptrissage qui ne doit pas durer moins de 15 minutes (Manu super biceps !!!). La pte doit devenir trs molle et lastique. Humecter vos mains d'eau, prendre la boule de pte et la taper sur la table (oui c'est un vrai combat !!!). La pte doit tre mallable et lgre. Laisser reposer la pte dans un saladier imbib d'eau, couvrir d'un linge et laissez lever dans un endroit tide durant 2 h minimum. La pte doit doubler de volume.. Reprendre la pte et former des boules de la grosseur d'une mandarine et tout en tournant, faire un trou au centre. Plonger les cercles de pte dans un bain d'huile trs chaude. Retourner pour cuire l'autre face. Il faut compter 3 minutes environ par beignets. Laissez les goutter dans une passoire et saupoudrez les de sucre en poudre. Servir bien chaud........

svpl recette de gateaux sinple
Le GTEAU MOUSSE AU CHOCOLAT, C'est une recette que j'ai prise sur recettes.qc.ca mais que j'ai un peu modifi car la crote ne se tiens pas bien dans la recette original. J'ai aussi ajout une ganache au chocolat noir qui donne une belle allure en plus de lui donner un bon "punch" en saveur. TAPE 1 - La Crote Gteau de Savoie 2 gros ufs 2 c. table (45 ml) de sucre 2 c. table (45 ml) de farine gteau et ptisserie tamise 1 c. th (15 ml) de poudre de cacao Prchauff le four 350F 1. Couper un rond de papier-parchemin de la grosseur du fond dun moule charnire de 10 pouces. Graisser et rserver. 2. Dans un bol, l'aide d'un batteur lectrique, battre les oeufs avec le sucre pendant environ 5 minutes ou jusqu' ce que le mlange soit ple et assez pais pour tomber en rubans lorsqu'on soulve les fouets. Tamiser la farine et la poudre de cacao sur le mlange d'oeufs et mlanger en soulevant dlicatement la masse jusqu' ce que la prparation soit homogne. tendre la pte dans le moule. 3. Cuire au centre du four pendant environ 10 minutes ou jusqu' ce que le dessus du gteau reprenne sa forme sous une lgre pression du doigt. Dposer le moule sur une grille et laisser refroidir. TAPE 2 - La mousse 8 carrs (8 oz; 250 g) de chocolat mi-amer hach 1 bote (300 ml) de lait concentr sucr Eagle Brand 2 c. table (30 g) de caf instantan (ou amarula, baeilys, kalua etc) 1/4 tasse (60 ml) d'eau tide (si on mets une liqueurs, moiti eau et moiti liqueur) 1 c. table (15 ml) de glatine 1 tasse (250 ml) de crme sure 2 tasses (500 ml) de crme 35 % 1. Graisser lgrement les pourtours du moule charnire rserv, avec de l'huile vgtale. 2. Dans un cul de poule. Faire fondre le chocolat au bain-marie sans porter l'eau bullition. Lorsque le chocolat a fondu, ajouter le lait concentr sucr et bien mlanger. Retirer du feu et laisser reposer. 3. Pendant ce temps. Dans un petit bol, mlanger le caf avec l'eau tide. Incorporer la glatine et bien mlanger. Rserver. 4. Dans un bol, fouetter la crme 35% juste assez pour qu'un petit pic se forme. Rserver. 5. Ajouter la crme sure au mlange de chocolat et le lait concentr sucr. Rserver. (A ce moment-ci de la recette, vous devriez avoir votre fond de gteau, le mlange caf-glatine, le mlange crme sure-chocolat et la crme 35%) 6. Faire fondre le mlange de caf et glatine au bain-marie ou au four micro-ondes (recouvrir d'un papier cir) 7. Bien mlanger le mlange de glatine puis l'ajouter au mlange de chocolat. Ajouter la crme 35%. Mettre la prparation sur le gteau de savoie. Rfrigrer 2 heures et tendre la ganache (tape 3) continuer la rfrigration un autre 4 heures. Si vous ne mettez pas de ganache, faire tout simplement rfrigrer le gteau de 4 6 heures avant de servir. TAPE 3 - La Ganache 4 oz de chocolat mi-amer, hach grossirement 1/3 tasse de crme 35 % 1 c. th de beurre doux 1 c. th de sucre Mettre le chocolat dans un grand bol. Dans une casserole, chauffer feu moyen-vif la crme, le beurre et le sucre, en remuant pour dissoudre le sucre, puis porter bullition. Verser le mlange la crme bouillant sur le chocolat. Laisser reposer pendant 2 minutes. Remuer jusqu' ce que le mlange soit lisse. Laisser refroidir la temprature ambiante. tendre sur le gteau. Remettre au frigidaire (comme mentionn plus haut) pendant 4 heures.

Liste des ingrdients * 150 grammes de farine * 1/4 de verre d'eau tide (15 cl) * 1 cuillre caf d'huile d'olive * 1 cuillre caf de sel * 1 sachet de levure Commencez par verser votre eau tide dans un bol puis soupoudrer la levure sur l'eau et laissez reposer 2 minutes. Mettre la farine dans un saladier et former une fontaine. Versez le levain (eau + levure) dans cette fontaine et ajouter l'huile d'olive. Mlanger la main jusqu'a obtenir une pte homogne. Mettez la pte en boule, recouvrez l d'un linge propre et sec. Laissez reposer temprature ambiante pendant 1 heure (la pte doit normalement doubler de volume). Posez votre boule de pte sur le plan de travail que vous aurez pralablement napp de farine. Travaillez la pte la main pour lui donner peu peu la forme et l'paisseur souhaite. Utilisez un rouleau a patisserie, n'hesitez pas retourner plusieurs fois la pte. Pince lgrement les bords de la croute. Garnissez votre pizza (Voir nos suggestions de garniture pizza) Pour la cuisson, prchauffer votre four 220C ( th.6-7) et faites cuire pendant 13 15 minutes
Recette pour 30 boules environ 300 de noix de coco rpe 100 gr de sucre glace 1/2 sachet de levure chimique suivant la recette ( pas indispensable) 1 cuillre caf de d'extrait de vanille naturel 2 gros oeufs 1 feuille de papier sulfuris pour la plaque du four de la noix de coco pour les rouler dedans perles argent des caissettes petits fours au Monop Melanger le sucre et la noix de coco, bien mlanger pour viter les grumeaux du sucre glace ou tamiser, puis ajouter les oeufs un par un, former les petites boules de coco avec la main, les rouler ensuite dans la noix de coco et les mettre dans les petites caissettes cuire au four entre 10 et 15mn (arrter quand la surface devient rose). Ils vont durcir en refroidissant. Par contre, il devait bien en avoir une trentaine, mais vu qu'ils disparaissent, je ne sais plus. La taille des oeufs joue sur la consistance, c'est pour cela que l'on les ajoute par un, la pte doit tre molle, personnellement elle ne collait pas aux mains, si cela vous arrive rajouter un peu de noix de coco. Vous pouvez aussi les faire aux amandes, aux noisettes, aux pistaches, dcor fruits confits vos ides donc !!

Saler. - Ajouter dans chaque pole une grosse cuiller de crme frache, et remuer la sauce autour des champignons d'un cot, et autour des escalopes de l'autre. - Lorsque la crme est fondue, mettre le tout dans une seule pole pour homogniser la sauce.

Zrir tunisien Ingrdient 2kg de sesames 1kg de noisette 500g pistaches 100gr de beurre 300gr de miel du commerce (on peut preparer un sirop pais avec du sucre en morceau) 3 4 c a s du vrai miel 1 louche d'huile d'olive Prparation - Il faut griller les fruits secs et les mixer jusqu'a l'obtention d'une texture pateuse. - Faire chauffer le beurre et le miel du commerce a feu doux, ajouter la pate des fruits secs et melanger energiquement avec une spatule en bois.Une fois que la pate est homogene,eteindre le feu, Ajouter les c a s de miel et l'huile d'olive en dernier Verifier le sucre..pour ma part, c'est vraiment pas sucr ce que j'ai mis comme quantit a vous d'ajouter le miel selon les gouts. Garnir avec pignon, pistache,...etc!! <3 MAYA <3
ESCALOPES PANEES 4 escalopes de veau bien fines - 1 oeuf - un peu de lait - chapelure - sel, poivre, muscade en poudre - beurre Prparation : Dans une assiette creuse, battez l'oeuf entier avec une larme de lait, du sel, du poivre et une pince de muscade. Dans une seconde assiette plate, talez la chapelure de sorte recouvrir compltement le fond de l'assiette. Passez successivement les escalopes dans l'oeuf battu, puis dans la chapelure, en prenant soin de les recouvrir entirement (l'oeuf fait adhrer la chapelure). Rajoutez de la chapelure dans l'assiette en cours de route si besoin. Faites dorer les escalopes panes dans une pole avec du beurre. Saisissez-les des deux cts pour que la chapelure soit bien dore, puis laissez-les cuire plus doucement quelques minutes selon l'paisseur. <3 MAYA <3

Guimauve (chamallows maison) Pour environ 8 personnes. - 2 blancs doeuf (environ 60 g, pas plus) - 250 g de sucre en poudre - 100 g deau - 10 g de glatine en feuille - 1,5 cuillre soupe darme au choix (moi, jai mis 1 c soupe 3/4 de sirop de fruit de qualit, ctait subtil, lger mais prsent) - quelques gouttes de colorant (facultatif) - 25 g de mazena - 25 g de sucre glace Graisser le moule ou la bote, le chemiser et saupoudrer dun peu du mlange mazena/sucre glace. Faire tremper la glatine dans de leau froide. Dans une casserole, mettre leau avec le sucre et le porter bullition. Cest l que celles qui ont un thermomtre doivent attendre datteindre 121. Pour ma part, jai compt 10 minutes partir du moment o le sirop commence bouillir. Javais un verre deau ct et jai teint le feu lorsque un peu de sirop forme une boule ferme mais encore souple quand on le met dans leau. Pendant que le sirop cuit, faire fondre trs doucement (jamais bouillir) la glatine ramollie, dans larme ou le sirop de fruit et rajouter dans le sucre cuit, hors du feu tout en mlangeant vivement. Monter les blancs en neige ferme (ils doivent tre dj monts quand le sirop est cuit) et y rajouter 30 g de sucre en poudre quelques secondes avant quils soient fermes. Tout en continuant de battre les blancs, verser dessus en petit filet, le sirop bouillant et continuer battre entre 5 et 10 minutes pour que le mlange tidisse bien. Verser dans le moule chemis et laisser au moins 2 heures dans le frigo. La masse doit tre ferme. Saupoudrer de mazena/sucre glace et mettre la guimauve sur un plan de travail. Enlever le papier et dcouper en petits cubes ou autre, et les rouler dans le mlange sucre glace, faire tomber lexcdent. Laisser quelques heures lair libre. Se conserve trs bien dans une bote <3 MAYA <3 hermtique.

Big fans of what you have done in the culinary field, even bigger fans of what you accomplished this year in horse racing. I think it would be a great idea for a show to cross Following owners and fans of the sport and tailgaiting. The sport could use a publicity boost and a fan base shift. Please look at our stable and keep on throwing down. 
A new blog post, mostly about The Blue Flower but with a little about the pedal steel guitar, the accordion, and Teal Wicks.

I spent my afternoon at Toscanini's Ice Cream with Gus and Mimi Rancatore. Gus is a master ice cream maker, and a damned great story teller. If you come to Boston this place has got to be on your to-do list. Two words: burnt caramel. 
12:17 AM seems like the right time to remind you that you should buy Jane Wiedlin's "Big Gay Ice Cream Song" on Itunes (if you haven't already).
Happy Birthday, Bryan! Hope you have a Special Day! Cake and... Ice Cream?
Happy New Year. This message was delayed because I wanted to make a long list of people to thank, but it's impossible. Thank you ALL for the amazing year. More crazy to come, we promise. We owe it to you. XO
How nice to end my day with a chuckle, courtesy of Toscanini's. I like being a walrus for a change, as I am usually just a common pig.
If you're in NYC for Social Media Week in February, maybe you'd like to attend this session. We're on a panel with Jeffrey Steingarten, Alex Guarnaschelli, and Ben Levanthal, moderated by Maile Carpenter, the Editor-In-Chief of Food Network Magazine.
I pity the fool who don't know enough to download DJ Cutlet's *free* ep, featuring his salute to The Big Gay Ice Cream Truck. Do it! Cutlet is power!
I visited the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck in June - It was amaze-balls!
The author of "Confessions of a Prairie Bitch" stopped by the truck over the summer and I've waited this long to share a little video with you. I always hold out on the good stuff. Visit Alison Arngrim Fan Page for more about her wonderful book.
We just finished recording a segment for our Italian television debut. Freaky! Here's Domenico Nesci, host of "Living in America," which will begin airing in February.
My new Iphone case arrived (thank you Santa) and it's just as gorgeous as I dreamed it might be.
Tonight's dessert: an individual ramekin with graham cracker crust, lined with apricot jam (from The Green Spot, Oakland ME), then some old-fashioned vanilla bean ice cream. Hold the whipped cream for me, then go heavy on it for Bryan.
Just saw you quoted in the NYT article about Chick-Fil-Hate. Well said! 
I guess it's safe to say this guy REALLY loves his Taco Bell.

has decided that Khazana's amazing buffet is feeding her and the family tonight. Only a good curry paired with some wine would get me out of the house in this weather!
going to try 9 grain blueberry muffins today...there might be a colossal kitchen fail coming up....
needs to make something incredibly sweet, perhaps chocolately and easy to transport to work on Sunday? Inspire me people...inspire me.
wishes the magic grocery fairy would come and stock her fridge instead of having to trudge through the slush today...
almost put margarine in her coffee instead of honey. And people eat the food I make them?
frying up mom's homemade perogies with some bacon and onions. What wine for perogies, red or white? A good Ukrainian girl would just have straight vodka.
wants to have Reese's peanut butter cups and a glass of wine for supper. To be honest, I can't find a single thing wrong with that sentence.
thinks that the En Sante Winery "Saucy Saskatoon" wine has to be the most delightful wine I have tried in ages! http://www.ensantewinery.com/wines.php
just wants soup. Feed a cold, starve a fever, or the reverse? How about I just feed them both soup.
Success! As long as my guinea pigs, er, work girls, give the thumbs up tonight there's a 9 grain, whole wheat blue berry muffin recipe coming up next week!
isn't going to complain about the feet upon feet of snow that seems to be falling. Instead I'll....uh..er..hmm. Yah, I got nothing.
Monkey Bread from scratch in the oven...snowy Sundays are meant for treats like this. Recipe coming this week!
Let's dream...speaking of trips to Mexico...what drink is in your hand right now? I have white sand between my toes and a Pina Colada in my hand, with a trashy romance in the other.
Definition of STUPIDITY : 1: the quality or state of being stupid. 2: a stupid idea or act such as drinking too much wine the night before your child's 11 am birthday party at Chuck E cheese. Cross reference with definition of "karma" as well.
wait...the Calypso wine (rhubarb) is pretty fantastic wine as well....not that I would ever get into two bottles in one night. Nope. Can I use the excuse that company is over?
just pulled her first 180 in the van. NOT on purpose.

Hey everyone - I'm hosting a giveaway for the almighty kitchen scale. Here's the info: http://www.melskitchencafe.com/kitchen-scale-giveaway
I'm working on perfecting the ultimate chocolate fondue - practice make perfect - and we've been practicing eating it a lot lately!
I have your pineapple salsa chicken in the crockpot right now...ohhh boy it smells awesome =-) I absolutely LOVE your blog. Thank you for taking the time to share with everyone!
Great job! You don't need Facebook tech support - you're doing great. Love your blog. I look forward to reading it.
I've been reading your blog and making the recipes for over a year. They are always yummy and just as you describe. :)
I love your blog and your recipes! It's the first place I go when I'm trying to figure out what's for dinner!
Made your hearty beef stew yesterday - I almost didn't follow exactly, but I did...and, o h m y g o o d n e s s!!!!!!!! Soooo absolutely fantastic! I had not been able to find a good beef stew recipe, until now! I have yet to make a recipe of yours and have it fail - they're always winners!!!!!!!
Love your blog! It's always my go to. I made the Sweet & Sour Chicken last week and my 7 year old said it was better then the restaurant! 
Yippee!! I just joined FB in November (am addicted now) and one of the first things I looked for was your page. Glad you are here....you have an awesome blog that I use all the time with fantastic results. 
We've been thinking of making a Mulligatawny Soup one of these days, so your choice of recipe comes at a good time for us.
I was looking for a great homemade chocolate cake recipe for one of little guy's birthday this last week and immediate came to your blog to see what was there. I used the Unbelievable Chocolate Cake and the "Magical Frosting" and it turned out amazing!!! I also come to your blog when I'm stumped on what to make for dinner during the week or when I'm looking for something new to try. Thank you for sharing your recipes!
I'm making your french bread and classic lasagna tonight. It's a sign of how much I trust you because I absolutely hate mushrooms - I don't know if I've EVER touched or cut up a mushroom before today! I could only do it because I knew it would they ground up and I wouldn't know they were in there!
Thanks for all the fabulous recipes. I have NEVER gone wrong when trying a recipe from your site. In fact, I tired the Bourbon Chicken recipe tonight, and it was a HIT! I've also hooked several of my sisters on your site! On a personal note, did you attend Ricks College? My sister believes you were in her ward, if you did! :)
Just tried your Chicken Cordon Blue Bread Bowls - A M A Z I N G!!!! And, I also made your Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies (but omitted the chocolate chips and put in peanut butter chips and reese's pieces - triple PB - delish!!) They are the most perfect PB cookie EVER!!!
Thanks, everyone! You sure know how to make a girl feel good. Your comments and my recent consumption of an exorbitant amount of dark chocolate (while hidden in my pantry) have made this day fantastic!
Okay, so I'm stuck at home with a broken leg and can't make any of your fabulous food right now. I'm super annoyed by that. Never fear - a friend of mine brought me dinner the other day: your Kansas City Sue's Chicken! I had printed that recipe but hadn't tried it yet. Of course it was yummy! Now if I could just make a rule that everyone who is going to bring me dinner must make something from your site, a broken might just be worth the trouble!!!!!!!
I made the chicken cordon blue bread bowls and they were a hit! I used your recipe for french bread bowls and they were super easy. Thanks for the recipes!
I LOVE your Glazed Poppy Seed Bread recipe - I'm making it today..Yum! :)
love your blog! thanks for all the delicious recipes. i recently had an indian night with your green curry, cous cous, and naan! it was all delicious. and just this week made my first beef stew ever....and of course used your recipe! the steamed veggies were great. thanks for sharing and making me enjoy menu planning that much more:)
Made your classic oatmeal chocolate chip cookies today and had several comments that they were "the best oatmeal cookies they've ever had!" booyah. you rock! :)
I may need to make a lot of bread bowls and your recipes look great! Have you made them in advance? Do they freeze well and how far in advance could I make them and freeze? Or better just do the day before? Thanks!
I LOVE your peanut butter chocolate chip cookies :) Made them last night, but made them into bars instead of cookies. So good!!! I could sit and eat them all! And my family loves the chocolate chip pumpkin bread!!
Just an update on the recipes I've made so far this week...Beef Stew- excellent comfort food. Bake Penne- phenomenal!! We all loved it!. Quick and Easy Clam Chowder- "This is the best soup I've ever had! Definitely make it again!" (Quoted by multiple family members.) Thanks again for an awesome site and thanks again for helping my find the smoked mozzarella. That really helped that pasta dish have a unique flavor.
It's 930 at night and I decided it was the perfect cookie makin time.. So Im making your classic chocolate chip cookies. I think all this dip/scoop/shakin/dippin talk made me hungry! I added butterscotch chips...because anything butterscotch makes me happy. :)
Gonna try your Carrot Cake tomorrow...but also was going to make cupcakes out of it. Just wondering if you've done that before and how they turned out! I'm sure they'll be great and my hubbys grandparents are going to loooove their little "wedding" cake for their big 60th anniversary party tomorrow! :)
For all of you who have entered the giveaway - I am loving the comments! Seriously, I've been chuckling all day and I'll never be able to view all of you in the same way now. Forevermore I'll be thinking of everyone as a dip-and-sweeper, scoop-and-shaker or something along those lines. Who knew our identities could be so wrapped up in flour measuring?
I am currently sitting in the midst of a winter weather advisory. Most normal people might wonder how on earth they'll get to the school to pick up their son and two carpool kids. No, not me. I'm wondering how on earth I'll get to the store to get chocolate chips for my cookie craving (which brings us to the next point of how on earth I let myself run out of chocolate chips in the first place!!). I have issues.
Last night, my husband and I went to a work dinner and I proceeded to eat five.whole.courses of the best food I've ever had in my life. Now I'm on an all-out search to make my own butternut squash filled ravioli, spinach/raspberry salad couched in a crispy, baked asiago cheese round and a creme brulee that I'm convinced is the answer to all my inner problems.
So I just shamelessly devoured an entire bread bowl filled with the best dip in the entire world (recipe to come next week!) and I'm wondering to myself, is there anything that wouldn't taste good in a bread bowl? Seriously.
Can I cry on your shoulder(s)? Today I made enchiladas for dinner. Disaster. Soggy tortillas. Too spicy filling (my kids were gagging). And all the flavors just completely off. And then, my first venture into Nanaimo bars? Disaster. Big time. Dry crust. Sweetsie filling. Plain awful. Two failures, one day. Not a great record. Aargh!
Ok, friends, I have a last-minute request - does anyone a) like dates (as in, the kind you eat, not the kind you go on with your significant other) and b) have a great date bar recipe they could share? Personally, I'm not the largest date fan but I have a dear friend from the Soviet Union who adores them and I need to take her a date-loaded treat tomorrow. Help!
The carrot cake cupcakes turned out AMAZING! I made these for my hubbys grandparents 60th anniversary party! Grandma's fave cake is carrot and oh wow...it was delicious! And the cupcakes turned out great!! I baked them @350 for about 15 minutes.

Hey Chef, i sent some Bacon art your way a couple weeks ago. wanted to check in and see that it made the trek safely

One of Amy's dishes got slammed today as a "Healthfood Imposter" in an article on MSNBC. "Culprit No. 13: Amy's Indian Paneer Tikka has 19 g of fat (and 320 calories) in a 9 -ounce serving. You'd think going meatless would be a healthy choice, but you can blame the cheese (made with whole milk), as well as the oil the dish is cooked in. " Guess I will have to make healthier choices in the future.

roasting veggies brings out their incredible flavor. the result? crispy, nutty, flavorful cauliflower that you can pop in your mouth like popcorn. trust me, you will not miss the cheese sauce.
it is nothing like a soothing bowl of soup after the hustle of the holidays...
smoked turkey blackeyed peas? check. buttermilk cornbread? check. cabbage? hhmm. should i make it braised or fried?
although i just ate some fried risotto cakes, i have good intentions. i bought some running shoes! who's with me?
if you are a mushroom lover like me, you will be on cloud nine. this same filling can be stuffed into cremini or button mushrooms as an appetizer.
whew. i just made a white ricotta pizza for dinner and boy was it good. this is the first time my husband requested something without meat! :) i will post the recipe tomorrow. what's for dinner tonight?
okay, who likes chipotle burrito bowls? i love them! a little too much though, so i came up with a mock recipe. when i get a hankerin', i make this recipe and keep some money in my pocket!
hi katie! the timing for your request could not have been better. my husband woke up this morning not feeling well. isn't having a sick spouse fun? :)
good enough for sunday dinner but also great for super bowl parties! pair it with my cheddar scallion corn cakes either as a chili topper or as a mop to soak up the flavorful goodness. :) 
i am about to marinate the chicken and make the barbeque sauce for my bbq pulled chicken, so i can throw it in the slow-cooker tomorrow morning. what's on your menu for sunday dinner?
i can not emphasize enough how much i love casseroles. toss in whatever you have on hand. this casserole easily feeds my family of 6 with leftovers. the tortilla chips put it over the top!
lightening up taco salad a tad with ground chicken. one of my kids favorites! mommy, can we have 'tico taco' for dinner tonight? how did they come up with that?
i bought way too much cilantro, my fav herb! i have been putting it in everything and am trying to figure out more ways to use it. cilantro lime chicken for dinner, maybe? what's your favorite herb?
bacon. pizza. what a combination! have mercy.
i need some good ole fashioned chicken noodle soup - - po man style please!
Yummy I love roasted veggies!
We are traveling through the mountains of Pennsylvania, enjoying the scenery along the way...with six hours until we reach our final destination -- HOME!
it is good to be back! :) the dressing on this caesar salad is good enough to eat with a spoon! a great way to use leftover chicken.
are we the only people grilling out in the cold? an indoor grill is sometimes not the same! the marinade for this chicken is full of asian flavors, sweet and has a subtle kick from the ginger. trust me, it's worth the frostbite. :) 
saturday mornings are made for hot breakfasts, just ask my family! these waffles are a healthy and delicious. a great way to start a saturday.
gotta love meals with awesome leftovers. these crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside treats are delicious. a must try.
i love this sauce! it is delicious on top of chicken, fish, steak...almost anything. 
creamy, cheesy, buttery rice loaded with earthy mushrooms. yes please.
we have had some shrimp requests from the shrimp lovers! shrimp can be expensive at times, but it is great to stock up and freeze them when they are on sale. oh and please do not be like me and forget to wipe the garlic butter off your face after you eat. :)
i love yogurt cake, especially since i always have yogurt in the fridge and it is made with pantry items. this is such a very versatile recipe. change up the extracts you add, such as lemon extract (w/some zest) or almond extract (w/some toasted almonds) to make it a different cake.
orange clouds of heaven! a great change from regular mashed potatoes.
for garlic lovers only! i hurt myself on this pizza last night. the hidden layer of flavorful ricotta gives this pizza a hint of creaminess that is oh so good!

Ted's cookbook recipes of life: In order to have an amazing journey you have to be willing to make and take a trip. The trip will not always go the way you want. You will face forks in the road.

Ted's cookbook recipes of life: By definition, inheritance is a birthright. Being born again, your Father has left you an abundant inheritance. It is yours to claim. A portion of that inheritance is released to you just when you need it. So there is no need for you to think and act poor. Truth is, you're not and cannot if your Father is not poor!
Ted's cookbook recipes of life: Your haters will try to tear you down. Oh yes they will try. They seek to have what you have and will use any decisive device to get to you. You have the flavor of favor that your enemies want. Stand tall and know that victory is yours.

Happy Twelfth Night Everyone! The Carnival Season has officially begun! Check out this website for all of the parades and fesitvities leading up to Mardi Gras Day! http://www.mardigrasparadeschedule.com/2011-Mardi-Gras-Parade-Schedule/ Come to New Orleans to celebrate with us... and stop by the Cooking School for a cooking class, to shop or just to say hi!!
my red beans and pralines turned out perfect last night!! Made Naw-lens style food for Sugarbowl party. So many compliaments thanks to Chef Kevin!!! I will be back to see you in Feburary.
Was at the school just before Christmas (my 2nd time) and thoroughly enjoyed it. Harriot did a great job and taught us well. Made the shrimp creole.. yummmmmm
 my Cooking' Cajun Cookbook is missing and I'm flipping out i need the bread pudding recipe and shrimp beignets. were on the Internet can i find there recipe.
Great class. We just happen to stumple across it! Took today's class.
Had a blast at last Thursday's class! Thanks so much for the great memories! I'm trying the Crab& Corn Bisque this week. Wish me luck!
Just listed! Awesome 40s cookbook!
Local food growers are the way to go!! It's great to have so many locally grown options where we live, and our local supermarket stocks them, so we aren't doing too badly despite the flooding down south.
Wish I could go help cook in Jamie's food kitchen in Ipswich!! Good on ya Jamie!! (Someone give that man a Thermomix!!!) :D
I made pizzas for breakfast today :) One is a fruit pizza (berries, rapadura & lemon juice, & pure maple syrup); the others were savoury (flavoured tuna, sun dried tomatoes, olives, dairy free melted 'cheese')... Told my ds I'd made him some df pizza, and he said "Isn't all pizza dairy free? It tastes like normal pizza!!" Yay! Will post the 'melted cheese' recipe soon.
Here's some greens that are easy to grow in North Queensland's wet, tropical environment - Ceylon Spinach (or Vine Spinach)... a great summer spinach!
Sorry guys, still haven't got the chicken & cashews w/ satay sauce typed up - too much paperwork tonight! And I made it and was going to take a photo, but had to dash out to pick up my dd, and when I got back the light was gone :( Back to the drawing board...
Okay, I have just one more place left for the Allergy Alternatives demo on the 7th January - first in, best dressed! I try to hold one of these at least once a month, so if you miss out but would like to come to one, let me know and I'll book you into the next one. :)
These double chocolate walnut brownies look wicked!... But they're really not :) (As long as you use good quality naturally sweetened chocolate!)
Sorting out my menu plan for the week... we're having Lentil Bolognese on brown rice tonight - what's on the menu at your place?
Making some lamb & vege soup in my tmx on this very wet and windy day in FNQ... and some spelt challah to have with it. :)
Support local businesses! Here's a Brisbane-based company offering natural cleaning products...
What's cooking at your house today? I've been doing lots of cooking - mostly at a Varoma demo :) Then I came home and made spelt tortillas, and spelt bread, and next on the list is dinner - turkey pot pie with yesterday's leftover roast turkey... then chocolate filled steamed buns with cherry sauce for dessert - the kids keep begging for them! :)
An old favourite... Spicy Lamb Cutlets (or chops) with Braised Lentils
Okay, I've developed a really yummy gluten free pizza base, with the help of Cyndi O'Meara's gf bread recipe in the gf cookbook! Just use 60g EVOO instead of the 30g macadamia oil, and leave out the eggs, spread the batter on baking paper lined pizza trays and cook at 220 degrees! 1 batch of batter makes 3 or 4 pizza bases, depending how thick you want it.
Yummy nori rolls with brown rice... Brown rice is so easy to cook in the Thermomix, and turns out lovely and fluffy. 1300g water, 400g brown rice in basket, Varoma temp, 35 mins, speed 4. 
Well, I was hoping to post a lovely, naturally sweetened pavlova recipe for Australia Day... but it just ain't working!!! Rapadura and xylitol don't make good pavlovas! Back to the drawing board... (Now you see what things are like behind the scenes here - not every recipe is an instant success!!!) Oh well, you win some, you lose some. :)
A most amazing poetic recipe by Fouad Kassab extolling the virtues of authentic Baba Ghanouj!!!

Spelt bread made with Challah recipe, brushed with olive oil, slashed, and sprinkled with flour. http://quirkycooking.blogspot.com/2009/01/challah.html
Just made your Nut Butter Brownies.....oh sooooo good!! Will be making them again soon methinks!
Top 5 antioxidant spices & herbs!
is your family completely dairy free? Im just curious :)
My cocoa butter order finally arrived (delayed by Christmas break and floods) and can't wait to make a batch of chocolate tomorrow with Macadamias!!! and when it comes to chocolate, I must confess I belong to the dark side ...mmm eat you , I will!!!
Beautiful poached eggs! http://trissalicious.com/2010/09/30/slow-poached-eggs-and-hollandaise-on-the-thermomix-is-it-cheating/
HI Jo...thanks for the great recipes so far today ! Hey, I was going to make the creamy salami fettucine (with free range bacon though) and was wondering what I could use instead of the cream (as we decided to start doing dairy free first)...would it work if I just left it out? And also....do you have an online supplier to get your products from? Our health food stores are dismal !
Hi I'm interested in trying to replace all the sugar in our house with Rapadura...(well interested in giving it a go anyway!) I just wanted to know where you get it? And also wanted to ask about Golden Syrup....is it bad or ok?
Thanks Jo, finally made my chocolate, some in little paper cups and some on a tray. I kept some plain and placed ginger and macadamias on parts of the tray so have a lovely mix. I was a bit worried as there seemed to be a bit of "sludge" sort of residue at the bottom of the bowl, but just poured it out over it all and it isnt even noticeable in the finished product...woo hoo you have made my decade!!!
Also made your apple and custard crumble which was yummy but think I overdid it a bit by putting all the custard in - next time I will keep some in reserve. Also made the Cashew cream and it was a big hit as well. Who needs TV when I can spend my night hours perusing these amazing blogs and getting such great ideas. 
omg Sometimes I truly amaze myself, had visitors when I was finishing off the chocolate so was a bit distracted. Just now realised that I didn't do the last step which was the salt....duh!! how lucky am I that it still tastes so great!!!
Berry Pizza (Spelt scone dough with berries, rapadura & lemon juice, and pure maple syrup drizzled over once cooked.) http://quirkycooking.blogspot.com/2009/09/dairy-free-spelt-scones.html
did the kiwifruit and lime sorbet on the weekend - had friends over for lunch....lovely flavours!!
JO, check out the Raw Cacao Fruit and Nut recipe on my notes... it was from the latest Wellbeing Magazine and is absolutely delish!
Before I go make my Lemon Butter, must tell you that I just made the Chocolate Banana nut Ice cream using pecans...wot can I say??? Heaven, I'm in Heaven....thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!
Hi, I had my demo yesterday and am about to sign on the dotted line for my machine tomorrow and came across your blog through google. I am mum to a 9 mth old with multiple food allergies, (dairy, wheat/gluten, peanuts & eggs) & my 2.5 yr old has a peanut allergy which has lead me to the Thermomix. It's nice & reasuring to find pages like this to help make this new journey a lot easier!!! :) 
Gluten free pizza base recipe with photos now posted on my blog! (I'm on a roll today!!)
I know I have asked you this before, but I have lost it, sorry, but Im trying to find your rice milk recipe.....thanks Loving the almond and sunflower milk..
Note to self: Do not eat two chocolate mousses and Mexican chilli-cinnamon chocolate before bed, especially if made from raw cacao powder... you will NOT sleep!!!! (Should have listened to my 13 yr old and had salad instead!!) lol
Guess what I'm making this morning to hand out at my Allergy Alternatives demo tonight??? A Mexican version of my "Almost Raw" Chocolate with freshly ground chilli and cinnamon... yeah!!!
Anyone else not been able to find my Rice-Almond Milk recipe? It disappeared off search on my blog for some reason... Here it is again...
Just made a 'green' sorbet - so yum! I used rapadura, Ceylon spinach, mixed berries, dates, raw cashews, vanilla extract, water, ice and an egg white... The kids have no idea that their sorbet has spinach in it!! Bwah ha ha!!!!
Gluten free Pizza Bianca cooking for lunch... and raw tomato soup (cold) - a yummy, summery, garlicky meal!! (Had a bit of a cold yesterday, so lots of raw garlic today!)
I love this girl! She's only 17 and has been a food blogger for two years - she's amazing! For those of you on a gluten free diet, try this delicious cornbread...
Making a banana cake with Rapadura-lemon icing...
Do you ever peel your garlic in your Thermomix?
Well, I can't find the photo I took of my Chicken & Cashews with cashew satay sauce, so I won't be posting it tonight - haven't got the ingredients to make it today! And the weather's so bad for taking photos anyway - wet and dark, and I like natural light for photos. I guess I'll post my Cantucci recipe instead - already have photos for that :)
Chicken stock paste: 300g cubed raw chicken, chopped veges to 2lt mark (leek/onion/shallots, carrot, garlic, celery/celeriac, bay leaf & fresh herbs - parsley, rosemary, thyme) - chop 10 secs sp 5. Add 150g rock salt, 1 clove, 5 coriander seeds, 50g white wine/20g white wine vinegar, 20g olive oil. Cook 20 mins, Varoma sp 2 (basket on lid, not mc); grind 1 min sp 9.
Have you tried this chocolate mousse recipe? So delicious - easy, and dairy free - no chocolate or cream needed! (Just cacao powder, rapadura, water, gelatin, cream of tartar & separated eggs.) Even if you're not dairy free, it's yummy!!!
"GREEN" SORBET: Grind 100g rapadura sp 9 til fine; add a handful baby spinach/Ceylon spinach, 70g organic raw cashews, 2 dates, 220g water, 1 tsp vanilla, whizz sp 9 1 min; add 300g frozen berries, 350g ice, 1 egg white, whizz sp 9 30 secs; add 350g more ice, whizz sp 9 1 min using spatula to help along. Enjoy!! :)
Hi all! If anyone made the Breudher this weekend, and you've still got some left but it's starting to dry out, just wrap it in foil and reheat it in the oven - comes up good as new! You can wrap it well and freeze it too, then reheat in foil in the oven. :)
This granola recipe looks amazing - cherry, pecan & coconut!
Tomorrow's the last day to enter my Blog Birthday Giveaway!! I'm so excited - somebody is going to LOVE their organic chocolate perfume & coconut body cream & geranium body bar (& more)... If you haven't entered yet, you have 1 day left! 
In North Queensland, we have a lot of fresh fruit and veges in our own 'backyards' - the rainforest and bush are full of them, you just have to know what to look for. My good friend Bel has planted lots of bush foods on her property, and she talks about what to look for in this article...
My friend Bel has a great online shop, and she is going to donate 50% of all sales (before freight) from midnight Thurs 13/1 until midday Sun 16/1 to the Australian Red Cross' disaster relief and recovery appeal. The Red Cross are renowned for making a real difference during times of crisis. Buy your back-to-school items, art & craft supplies & gifts, and help flood-affected families at the same time.
Did you know that children who eat up to a dozen beef frankfurters each month are at an approximately four-fold increased risk of brain cancer and seven-fold increased risk of leukaemia? (This is due to the formation of a nitrosamine carcinogen, by the interaction of nitrate and natural amines in meat). (from 'Additive Alert' by Julie Eady, via Let's Party Additive Free Newsletter)
Dinner tonight was G'ma's Baked Chicken with Cornbread Dressing (stuffing) - sooo yum! Kids comments were: 'This is DEFINITELY a five-star cafe!' from Mr I, and 'I think the cornbread should have lemon in it' from Miss C! (??) Actually, maybe that would be nice - lemon cornbread... hmmm...
Try this next time you make treat balls for an extra energy boost - add a handful of raw cacao nibs, and a drizzle of coconut oil if needed to stick it all together! 
Have you tried this yummy dessert? Gluten free, dairy free Apple-Berry Custard Crumble!
Mum's making apple & rhubarb pies for Sunday lunch and her house smells delightful! I think we'd better go to Mum's for lunch tomorrow!! Hoping to post her cornbread dressing recipe tonight... it's so yum!
How's this for a deliciously healthy ice-cream cake?!!

Help! How do I make peanut butter in the Ninja Pro System 1100? The infomercial and website both claim it can do it but customer service/technical support just keep saying, "you must need a recipe for that". No recipe is working. I just get ground up nuts but not nut butter! The infomercial shows beautiful creamy peanut butter and he says, "I've just finished making peanut butter the Ninja way". Well, what is the Ninja way? I am getting nowhere with customer service and I have spent a lot of money grinding nuts but never achieving nut butter. I don't think the recipe is a problem because I have tried several. I need instructions for the machine itself. Thank you for your help!

Can't wait to see more about the Ninja. I LOVE my Shark products and think the Navigator beats the Dyson vacuum for a much better deal! And my steamer is my godsend with an all hardwood home on three levels!
The Ninja Blender gave me 5 stitches on my thumb when the blade fell out while i was pouring a milkshake. You guys really need to make a "lockable" blade because this "death blade" is very dangerous.
I'm dying here...I just checked online and my Ninja should be here by the 2nd of Feb....hurry! Hurry!! My Magic Bullet broke last week and were dying over here not able to make our pasta sauce (the way the wife likes it). Hurry Ninja...Hurry!!!!

ConAgra , I sure do wish you would bring back my Penrose Sausages in the jars ! My favorite snack is Penrose sausages , Lance square nabs ,and a Pepsi cola ! Also my wife uses the small Penrose sausages to make pigs-in-a-blanket, and making them with the individually wrapped ones can get a little pricey . I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels this way. Please ConAgra bring em back !!
Bring back the pemrose sausages in the jar ...horrible buisness to not sell them anymore...the singles in the pack are horrible

Girl Scouts Gone Vegan!! Thin Mints to the rescue! http://www.chefchloe.com/blog/2-blog/45-thin-mints-girl-scout-cookies.html
Congratulations again on your win on Cupcake Wars! What an eye opener for most people; you can eat vegan and still have cupcakes! Also saw the VegEdge segment. Will you be having your own show? There definately needs to be a vegetarian/vegan cooking show on TV. Can't understand why the Food Network and The Cooking Channel don't have one? Keep on doing what you're doing.....
does anyone know how long to chill the coconut milk for in any of her recipes? like the chocolate mousee or others? or do u just chill it until its hard on top?
I love your vegan cupcake recipies (i.e. strawbery shortcake). I want to make a birthday cake for my daughter using the recipe. How can I modify the recipe to make a cake (for 25 people)?
i want to order some cookies. i am so bad at baking. do you sell them?
your thin mint cookie recipe looks so good! do you think you could make a recipe for samoas? those were my favorite! or any suggestions i could try?
Wish either the Green Channel or the Cooking channel would give you a show as you have so much to teach so many people.
Watched your win on Cupcake Wars last night, here in Toronto. Congratulations. Your idea for OK! Magazine's Singles Event was certainly the topper! You rock Chloe, carry on!
Just tried your chocolate mousse recipe....so heavenly! Why eat the non vegan kind when Chef Chloe's recipe is so divine?!
Chef Chloe you Rock! Loved your avacado pesto pasta! You need your own show you know:)

Happy Birthday Chef!!! Thank-you for teaching me how to cook...and sharpen(in an emergency) my knife on the back of a ceramic plate;-)
Dear Chef Ppin, I am a great admirer of your work. In which cookbook is your recipe for Chicken Ballotine (it may be Gallotine)? I have an old VHS from the mid-90s that shows the method and the recipe (the stuffing had wild rice and mushrooms), but no measurements. I made it twice, but it has been so long ago, I cannot remember. Thank you for your help.
Have just begun your wonderful autobiography...such a wonderful writer, such a wonderful life!
Dinner tonight - Instant Beef Tenderloin Stew. It's one of my favorites from "Fast Food" - and always a hit. Happy eating.
I so love watching Chef Pepin and his knife skills. When he slices veggies, I am in awe.
A lil cognac for me...lol
Pepin is hands-down my favorite chef, celebrity or not. I just consulted The Complete Pepin today for poached eggs this morning... One day I'll get it right. Happy Cooking!

In Lebanon, farmers roast fresh green durum wheat right out in the fields to make freekeh (or farik), a process that gives the grains a delicate smoky flavor.

I realize I'm brand new to the blog, but I'm a bit confused: How do you end up with 15 dinners when there are 7 or 8 dinner recipes (depending on the month)? How does it get broken down between the 2 families? I must be daft.
I have a quick question for you - do the wraps get soggy in the freezer like tortillas do?
Just made the Chicken Tortilla soup from the Diet menu and it is AMAZING. The portion size is almost too big! That's fantastic news! I topped mine with just a little bit of shredded cheese and a Tbsp of plain yogurt (instead of sour cream). SO GOOD! 
Okay, I am really confused. I found your site because of the new Diet menus. In the FAQ it says that there are 15 breakfasts/10 lunch/15 dinner. But I only see 3/4/8 on the Traditional menu. I went back to look at the menus from the beginning and see the same numbers. And with the diet menu there are 2/4/6. I know we aren't making meals for every day of the month but this makes it more like Once a Week Cooking. Am I missing something?

The reviews on this recipe are fricking HILARIOUS. Sample review: "Personally, I think this recipe could be improved by the addition of a bit more bacon and a bit less paper towel.

b'Contest of the day!\nWhat type of Baker Hughes PDC bit drilled multiple intervals consisting of shale and sandstone with thick, hard limestone stringers in southern Oklahoma? \nHint: the answer can be found on our website... '
b'Did you know?\nIn 1907, a 29-year-old chemist named William Sidney Barnickel traveled from St. Louis to visit the Glenn Pool oil field in Oklahoma where large quantities of oil were wasted because they were mixed with water that had been produced along with it. Such \xe2\x80\x9ccut\xe2\x80\x9d oil, known as \xe2\x80\x9cbasic sediment,\xe2\x80\x9d was either burned or dumped into creeks near many of America\xe2\x80\x99s oil fields. Seeing this waste and contamination, Barnickel began working on the problem of separating oil from water.\n\nIn December 1911, he discovered that a chemical agent, a sulfate of iron (copperas), could efficiently do the job, and in 1913 he applied it to recover 56,000 barrels of oil from basic sediment at the Caddo field in Oklahoma. After several tries, he was finally granted a U.S. patent for the chemical treatment on April 14, 1914.\n\nDetermined to manufacture large quantities of his chemical that could be readily shipped throughout the country, Mr. Barnickel returned to St. Louis to outfit a factory. He sold the first two barrels of Tret-O-Lite on November 17, 1917. On that day, the company that would become Baker Petrolite had begun commercial operations.\n\nBarnickel is pictured (left) with one of the first barrels of Tret-O-Lite demulsifier.'

b'Did you know?\nIn 1918, Mr. Baker became a manufacturer, when Baker Casing Shoe Co. bought a machine shop in Coalinga, California, for $52,000. The early manufacturing facilities were meager, with 3,400 square feet of floor space, two lathes, a drill press, a power saw, a shaper and one pipe-threading machine. The new plant manufactured Baker casing shoes, dump bailers, clean-out bailers and cement retainers, as well as other equipment that the company had been licensed to manufacture.\n\nThe oil boom in the Los Angeles area in the early \xe2\x80\x9820s was a period of rapid growth for the Baker Casing Shoe Co. In 1922, Baker built a new plant and headquarters in Huntington Park, California. In addition to other Baker products, this plant produced tool joints, which were in great demand in the new oil fields.\n\nBy 1924, much of the company\xe2\x80\x99s sales came from the Mid-Continent area, and a branch office was opened in Tulsa to handle the increasing business. Branches were also established in Bakersfield and Taft, California in 1924, and an export representative was established in New York. By 1927, Texas provided a significant sales volume, and a warehouse and office were established in Houston.\n\nIn 1927 Baker gained industry leadership in cementing-related tools with the introduction of a complete line of guiding, floating and cementing equipment, including a drillable cement float shoe and collar and a cement guide shoe.'

Warm up with our January Recipe of the Month! Created by the Sacred Heart Shelter, 40 Seasonal Soups is filled exclusively with soup recipes for every season, and the Bakery Soup with Roasted Chicken and Vegetables is a delicious way to fight the cold weather. Check it out here: http://www.morriscookbooks.com/dc/RecipeofMonth1-11.pdf. One of the ways Sacred Heart Shelter promoted their cookbook was by creating a Facebook page just for it. It includes photos, as well as tips and reviews: http://www.facebook.com/pages/40-Seasonal-Soups-A-cookbook-benefitting-Sacred-Heart-Shelter/195419095985. The cookbook was also reviewed by Rebekah Denn, a food journalist. Read her review here: http://www.eatallaboutit.com/2009/09/28/40-seasonal-soups. We think youll agree this cookbook and their marketing strategy are unique and creative!

For some reason my browser does not allow me to see the full page when I try to estimate the cost of printing a cookbook. Can anyone ballpark it for me so that I can see if I should continue investingating this opetion or if I should just move on. Im looking for a basic book with about 200 recipies. Thx

More chocolate is eaten in winter than any other season. So, let us ask you: Does chocolate keep you warm?
Will you be doing another contest to win Milanos any time soon? I missed the last promo and I love my milk chocolate Milanos. <3
Just got done eating my fav cookie in the whole world. When im mad all i have 2 do is eat a milano cookie
My dog just ate two bags of Bordeaux cookies.....so not happy right now
I love love love the orange one's!
Just cleaned and organized my cupboard and found 1 bag of orange milanos and 2 bags of strawberry milanos... yummy! 
Just want to say i love the mint milano cookies
The new Strawberry Milano cookies are wonderful!!!
Mint milano, always a treat!!
I m a Milano-phile from Hong Kong! wanna try strawberry flavour in HK~
Discovered Milano Cookies earlier this year(in 2010)and they are my favorite cookie. I am always looking for a sale or coupon on them. Walgreens carries them!
We love Milano cookies yum chocolate.
Milk chocolate Milano has been my favorite cookie for along time. Where did you come up with the name Milano?
So this might be strange, but it happened... I went to the ER After hitting my head on Sunday evening. I was in A LOT of pain and a little concerned. BUT, when I walked passed the drs/nurses station, I saw they were eating Milanos - the SGK pink bag. When I saw the bag, I took it as a sign... all was going to be all right. And it was! Today, I had some Milano Slices, the toffee one is my favorite (though it is hard to pick!!!)
I LOVE the strawberry Milano's!!! They are the best! I could eat the whole bag in one sitting. ;)
My family was SO DISAPPOINTED this year because nowhere could we find the seasonal chocolate covered milanos! I sent my daughter off to college with every comfort from home except for these favorite cookies of hers. Please bring them back - they are amazing!!!!
Nothing like a Milano cookie with a cup of coffee, and a good friend, after putting the kids to bed for the night! <3

Have a question about Friday Freebies and qualifying items. My freebie coupon scanned as $0 When I asked why, head clerk checked my receipt and said since I had bought sour cream and coffeemate these items were dairy and therefore didn't qualify. I understand liquid milk being state controlled and therefore unable to be part of discounts along with tobacco and liquor. But how is a customer to know what you consider "dairy"? Coffeemate has no dairy! I think you need to make it only fluid milk. Thanks & love Friday Freebies

I was at the store today in Campbell, CA, and when in the baked goods section noticed a package of cookies with M & M's in them and NO DECLARATION of peanuts in the allergen warning. I need to be able to trust, of all places, my local grocery store. My child has a life-threatening allergy to peanuts/nuts and I read labels like a hawk. Can you tell me what happened? Also, none of the packages declare that they are baked in a nut facility, so I'm assuming that there is a special factory for half of the baked goods?

b"The #HydroPack project begins today as designer @austenangell of @modernedge is researching the reaction of 80 families from the Mudimbia village in Kenya. Eastman's cellulosic technology makes the #HydroPack possible - @austenangell is now looking for ways to make it easier to use."
b'The word for Day 2 of the #HydroPack demo project was, "Nice!" \n\nAccording to Keith Lampi, COO of Hydration Technology Innovations, \xe2\x80\x9ctaste and acceptance issues are very important to us. Even during emergencies, if water products don\xe2\x80\x99t generate a good-tasting drink, it can be difficult to persuade disaster victims to use them." \n\nThe smiles that the #HydroPack is producing seems to be an early indication that the product is achieving very high acceptance rates.'
b'News keeps coming in from Mudimbia, Kenya on the HTI demonstration. According to Gaylon & Co., it\'s all smiles! Dr. P.K. Carlton, Jr., former surgeon general for the US Air Force, attests to the importance of such relief aides such as the #HydroPack. He says, "The #HydroPack is not only ideal for potable water, it supplies the electrolytes that are necessary for life."'
b'Through HTI\'s Forward Osmosis Technology and Eastman\'s Cellulose Acetate (the material used in the membrane of the #HydroPack), Eastman may be contributing to disaster relief in the future. "Disaster relief comes down to dollars," says Dr. Carlton. "The dollars to move the #HydroPack could be significantly less than the dollars used to move bottled water."'
b'Day 1 of the #HydroPack demo was a success! 200 #HydroPacks were distributed to 90 households in the Mudimbia village, Kenya. Villagers marveled at how dirty water could be made into a tasty drink! They were coming up with ideas on how the #HydroPack can be used locally. Local relief agencies see #HydroPack as a way of creating awareness of hydration solutions that can save lives.'
b'HydroPacks\xe2\x84\xa2 to be featured on Fox TONIGHT (1/31) at 7:00 pm!\n\nWalt Schultz of HTI will be interviewed on tonight\xe2\x80\x99s edition of America\xe2\x80\x99s Nightly Scoreboard tonight at 7:00 pm. The HydroPack\xe2\x84\xa2 story truly embodies Eastman\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to innovation and sustainability. Schultz will be discussing the HydroPack\xe2\x84\xa2 product and business strategy as well as highlighting the recent demonstration in Kenya.'
b'@AustenAngell @modernedge is also blogging about the #hydropack! http://bit.ly/fMJHQF\nTks to UBER for taking pics! http://bit.ly/hYZ369'

I hope the CI folks will take this to heart as it is meant sincerely. I've had their mag subscriptions and even given them as gifts. I ordered a cookbook of theirs last year and was disappointed to find that it was merely a compliation of all of the magazines, binded. Well, I already had all of the mags...now they've sent me a second cookbook (2010) which I did not order. The did the old "auto send and bill" where now I have to take the time to re-package, postage it and send it back - a hassle. They are perilously close to losing my support and business.
It's our taste test of the week: Gruyere cheeses. See which brand made it to the top of our list, and which ones we'd avoid: http://ow.ly/3IEEC
We had a superstar Cook's Illustrated Weekend- Thai Green Curry on Friday and Vindaloo on Sunday..... resulting in the Vindaloo voo-doo otherwise known as food coma. So so so so good!

Happy National Chocolate Cake Day! Celebrate today by making a chocolate cake in 4 steps: http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/detail.asp?docid=18766
Question about the website: where's the frosting recipe that this cupcake recipe references? http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/detail.asp?docid=23637
Soy sauce and tomato paste in your chicken pot pie? It may sound odd, but they're key ingredients to our recipe: http://ow.ly/3LUOs
On the chocolate icebox cookie recipe I cannot find a time for how long to bake them. Am I missing something?
After dealing with ATK customer service, I now completely understand, and have sympathy for, others' complaints. Inappropriate billing, perpetually-unavailable online account information, no response to multiple emails, calling and getting absolutely no option to talk to a person, and, predictably, not being called back after leaving a message - my considerable enthusiasm for ATK's products and websites is quite dampened at the moment. I assume the folks at ATK care about their reputations, so I don't know why they let dreadful customer service and inappropriate (a word I use only because I'm a bit reluctant to use fraudulent) billing practices continue. If our concerns aren't corrected quickly, we're going to stop recommending their online sites on our blog, and may entirely discontinue reviewing and/or recommending ATK recipes and products. We're strongly considering not renewing any of my subscriptions, for either the online sites or the magazines.
Used your chicken tikka masala recipe as my inspiration for a quick version with lamb meatballs. Even quicker than the version you printed and just as good! Served with garlic naan made from refrigerated pizza dough as a shortcut (not the stuff from the can though.) Thanks for doing the research and testing so I can just play in the kitchen!
Happy Brunch! Here's our recipe for your Sunday treat: Buttermilk Waffles. http://ow.ly/3Mfaz
Chicken tandoori was a huge hit! now I got a quiche lorraine in the oven...not bad for someone who's new at this. Thank you!
Think all chicken is created equal? The right bird can make or break your dish. Check out our review for the best premium chicken: http://ow.ly/3MXCI
I want to say I was disappointed today to find out my membership is not good enough. I was looking on the site that I already pay to access, and found out to get a recipe that looked good, I would have to 'upgrade' my membership. How about you stop with the dishonesty and just raise the prices at renewal? How sneaky. 
Tonight I made the Skillet Lasagna with Sausage & Peppers | Editors Choice Cookbook Collection. From The Best Skillet Recipes.
I made the cranberry pecan tart as a pie. One suggestion to the recipe---heat the cream before adding to the caramel. This will prevent the cold cream from solidifying the caramel.
Saturday lunch: arugula, pear, roquefort & walnut salad classic minestrone chocolate dipped triple coconut macaroons
The _Best_ Blueberry muffins, part of this balanced breakfast :-) Subbed yogurt for sour cream and put turbinado sugar on top for a sweet crunch.
Made (and loved) the chicken saltimbocca (from February 2008). Served it with the spaghetti al limone (from January/February 2011).
We've been enjoying the American Sandwich Loaf lately and it's variations. This time I thought I'd try something new and combined the Oatmeal, Buttermilk, Whole Wheat, and Anadama recipes into a kitchen sink multigrain loaf. I spent a good deal of time making sure I had the various ratios correct before trying. The end result was easy to work with, and very tasty. I thought I'd share the recipe as well, in case others wanted to try it. Note the instructions are mostly pulled from the website and modded based on my changes. I used a bread machine on dough setting which eliminated the mixing and first raise needs, but I imagine these instructions for a stand mixer should work just as well. 5/6 cup water (alt. add 1/2 cup and 1/3 cup for easy measuring) 1/4 cup cornmeal 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 3/4 cup bread flour 1 cup whole wheat flour 2 teaspoons salt 1 cup buttermilk 3 Tablespoons molasses hot 2 Tablespoons butter melted 1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) instant yeast 1. Bring water to boil in small sauce pan. Add oats and cornmeal; cook to soften slightly, about 90 seconds. Set aside. (Alternately I simply added boiling water to the meals and stirred to combine, then let it cool) 2. Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Once oven temperature reaches 200 degrees, maintain heat 10 minutes, then turn off oven heat. 3. Combine hot molasses and melted butter to cold buttermilk to temper the mixture. 4. Mix cooked meal, flour, and salt in bowl of standing mixer fitted with dough hook. Mix buttermilk mixture and yeast in 1-quart Pyrex liquid measuring cup. Turn machine to low and slowly add liquid. When dough comes together, increase speed to medium (setting number 4 on a KitchenAid mixer) and mix until dough is smooth and satiny, stopping machine two or three times to scrape dough from hook if necessary, about 10 minutes. Turn dough onto lightly floured work surface; knead to form smooth, round ball, about 15 seconds. 5. Place dough in very lightly oiled bowl, rubbing dough around bowl to lightly coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; place in warm oven until dough doubles in size, 40 to 50 minutes. 6. Form dough into loaf by gently pressing the dough into a rectangle, one inch thick and no wider than the length of the loaf pan. Next, roll the dough firmly into a cylinder, pressing with your fingers to make sure the dough sticks to itself. Turn dough seam side up and pinch it closed. Place dough in greased 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan and press gently so dough touches all four sides of pan. 7. Cover with plastic wrap; set aside in warm spot until dough almost doubles in size, 20 to 30 minutes. Heat oven to 350 degrees, placing empty loaf pan on bottom rack. Bring 2 cups water to boil. 8. Remove plastic wrap from loaf pan. Place pan in oven, immediately pouring heated water into empty loaf pan; close oven door. Bake until instant-read thermometer inserted at angle from short end just above pan rim into center of loaf reads 195 degrees, about 40 to 50 minutes. Remove bread from pan, transfer to a wire rack, and cool to room temperature. Slice and serve.

Thank you, Cook's Illustrated, for helping me look good!!! Seriously - THE best chicken pot pie I've ever had... and because of you I made it myself!!!
GREAT pasta filling recipe! Used it for my food shoot.

"The Best 30-Minute Recipe" has been my weeknight lifesaver for years. This was yet another hit from that book.
Dear Cook's: I recently made and enjoyed your Whole Wheat Spaghetti with Cauliflower, Pine Nuts and Raisins. However, I believe I've now come down with a case of "Pine Mouth" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_nut#Risks_of_eating_pine_nuts). Moral of the story: Don't buy cheap Asian pine nuts from Trader Joe's. Thought I would share in hopes of sparing others. Maybe you could put a note in the recipe?
thin crust no yeast pizza, exactly what my daughter was looking for. We made this on Christmas Day using the basics of the St.Louis Pizza recipe from the Best Recipes and Reviews 2011.
Best Blueberry Muffins from the May/June 2009 issue. I made these for breakfast yesterday morning. We both loved them... easily the best blueberry muffins we've ever had.
Another shot of the Best Blueberry Muffins from yesterday morning.
I made the Thin-Crust Pizza from the newest issue a second time. It turned out every bit as great as the first time.
Crispy, tasty, with an excellent crust... a superior thin-crust pizza.
I'll be making this one a lot more often. Here's hoping CI gets around to doing a stuffed pizza recipe one of these days.
I used the recipe for Chicken Pot Pie with Savory Crumble Topping (from the September 2010 issue) to make a Turkey Pot Pie.
I had some leftover turkey from having roasted a turkey recently, and I used that along with turkey stock made from the turkey carcass in place of cooking chicken and using chicken broth or stock as directed in the recipe. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.
So, I hear it's National Pie Day today: http://ow.ly/3I3S0 What pies are you baking today? Here's our Ultimate Lemon Meringue Pie recipe! http://ow.ly/3I3VP

Whats your favorite way to cook chicken?
A great cake to christen my new bundt pan that I got for Christmas. =) http://diskitchennotebook.blogspot.com/2011/01/messy.html
Crunchy Chicken from Cook County's Best Lost Suppers
Your Boneless Short Ribs recipe from 2009 (slightly modified-I didn't have enough red wine so I used port and organic tomato sauce-that's why it's so red). Served over my own potato gnocchi :) I'm so glad I found boneless short ribs! So much leaner and nicer to eat!
We were stuck at home last week in Atlanta due to ice and the kids were begging me for pizza. So, I (finally!) tried the skillet pizza and crust recipe from the 2010 The Best of America's Test Kitchen. My family loved it so much we have a new Friday ritual and it is centered around this pizza. Thanks!!

Molasses Spice Cookies with Dark Rum Glaze
Give these Coconut Toffee Chew Bars a try from The ATK's Family Baking Book--they're delicious! Even my skeptical husband couldn't keep his mitts off. :) Thank you CI for making dining in exciting again--you have inspired many delicious meals. Now I actually prefer home cooked meals to dining out.
Grill Roasted Pork Loin (July/Aug 2005) and French Style Mashed Potatoes (March/April 2009) and my blog post from April 2010.

Quick tip: Keep cheese fresher, longer with waxed or parchment paper loosely wrapped with aluminum foil. Both papers wick moisture away, while the foil cover traps just enough water to keep the cheese from drying out. Have a Quick Tip that makes your life easier in the kitchen? Leave a comment here.

Few foods are more versatile than chicken; what's your favorite way to cook it?
By coincidence, National Chocolate Cake Day is the day I made your Dark Chocolate Cupcakes with your Creamy Chocolate Frosting. They are so light and full of rich chocolate flavor.
The brand new spinach and feta pie recipe was a huge hit at our New Year's day party! Instead of sesame seeds, I sprinkled nigella seeds on top which are used on the turkish version of spinach pie (brek). Thanks for the recipe!
Brown Sugar Cookies! They were delicious!
Today I made Quick and Hearty Chicken Noodle Soup. Best chicken soup ever.
We love the classic tomato & basil, but there's so much more to Bruschetta. Our recipe calls for whipped feta, roasted red peppers, and no bib: http://ow.ly/3x5BI
A steak for 50 cents? This restaurant allows you to pay whatever you want for your meal. http://ow.ly/3xnyI
Almost No-Knead Bread - thank you for FINALLY teaching me how to make a great loaf of bread. :)
Made the Best Beef Stew on Monday (sorry, no pictures, it didn't last long enough!) - FANTASTIC recipe. Tonight it will be the French Onion Soup. I used to search Food Network for recipes, I have become a CI convert. Your recipes are hands down the best.
When it comes to Chicken saltimbocca, sometimes more is just more. Try our simplified version that is anything but plain: http://ow.ly/3yn3k
want to know what happened to the "All Purpose Chocolate Cake" (page 526, Family Cookbook". It turned out REALLY dry. And the "Quick and Rich Vanilla Frosting" was not generous enough to cover the whole cake fully. Normally everything turns out as promised, but not this time. Any ideas? 
Strip, Filet mignon, rib eye: each cut is little different. Ensure your steak is cooked just the way it should be with our how-to video: http://ow.ly/3zj4E
Hey, Cook's Illustrated! Can you proof bread dough in a slow cooker?
OK, I'm all psyched to make your triple-chocolate mousse cake this weekend....but I can't find instant espresso powder... I looked in the coffee isle - is that where it would be? Help!
Made the Best Blueberry Muffins from May/June 2009 CI issue. They were not kidding when they say Best. Everyone who tried one said it was the best blueberry muffin they ever had. Period. You must make these. Thanks CI.
Portions scoops are for more than just ice cream; Here's why they make such a good measuring tool for everyday cooking: http://ow.ly/3zxqZ
I tried to express my dissatisfaction as a paying subscriber discreetly via a private note through the website contact form, and got a canned reply that seemed to think I was having login trouble. Replied to that, and got the exact same irrelevant canned reply. I am now disappointed not only with the original issue, but additionally with the callous handling by automated 'customer service' features. What gives, CI? 
Meatloaf, roast potatoes, green beans, and large, chunky cookies: We can't think of a better way to end a wintery Monday: http://ow.ly/3AvOb
Can't tell if that food is expired? Not with this color-changing wrapping http://ow.ly/3AQ0f
Today, I made Classic Pot Roast (Nov.2010), Green Beans with Onion and Bacon (Nov.1996), and Mashed Potatoes and Root Vegetables for Two (Nov.2007). I also made Parker House Rolls. I was aiming for an "Ultimate Grandma" sort of meal. Being a 46 year old guy, I don't have a Grandma anymore so I just put on her dress while I cooked this.

I'm waiting for a Cook's Tom Yum Soup recipe! Here's to hoping it's on your list!
There was a recipe today for Blueberry Muffins that was absolutely outrageous - I can't wait to try it. AND, their omelette. OH MY GOD 
Did you know white chocolate isn't really chocolate at all? Nevertheless, it's still a key ingredient in some delicious treats. We tested 9 brands to see which is best for your baking http://ow.ly/3C31J
The recipe for Greek Spinach and Feta Pie is from Heaven MUST TRY IT
The recipe for Greek Spinach and Feta Pie is from Heaven MUST TRY IT
Not all yeast is created equal; see the different types & know which one you want in your recipe: http://ow.ly/3CK5U
Maybe you can answer a question for me. I looked this morning at recipes for angel food cake. They all stated that the slightest drop of oil or grease will cause the egg whites to fall. However, souffle recipes call for the ramekins to be greased. Why the difference? 
Any words of wisdom on silicone vs wooden rolling pins? The last equipment review was in 2005 and their were mostly wooden & marble pins being compared.
Out of buttermilk? You may not be out of luck: See what can be swapped, and how to make sure no one can tell the difference: http://ow.ly/3CK2P
I made the yellow cake in the February Cook's Country issue today, not once but twice. Each time I followed the recipe to a t. However, each cake ended up flat and dense. I noticed a variation in the cake flour quantity from the magazine version versus the online recipe. I assume this is due to sifting, which as the recipe instructed, I measured after sifting. What could be wrong? I have fresh ingredients, including the baking powder.
I just cooked up Indoor Pulled Pork...and it tastes amazing!! I used Bulls Eye Barbeque sauce instead of making my own. I can't wait for the company to come later today so I can share!! Thanks!!
i use CI a lot. Today looked up roast smashed potatoes online at CI and the recipe is incomplete. Help
Thanks to Cooks Illustrated, I can do cool things like this. Almost No Knead Bread...sandwich style. 100% whole wheat. upped the quantity by 20% to fill the loaf pan.

Hi Osama, I am a friend of Michelle Nickelson. She sent me your website and I would like to be friends. To answer your question; fennel and anise are not the same seed. They have similar taste.

:: just joined...looking forward to not only saving money in the food budget area but losing weight before I have gastric bypass surgery this summer!!!
Joined Sunday & went grocery shopping at the commissary. I spent only $55 buying items from the *7 day low fat any store menu! I altered the menu a bit to replace ground beef w/ground turkey, chicken breasts w/turkey breasts & excluded the breads bc I make those myself;) Tonight, I made the Spinach Feta Florentine (chicken)Turkey & my family loved it. I was quite surprised bc I have a couple picky eaters! it was also VERY easy & quick to make!!! THANKS SO MUCH! 
Spinach Fettuccine from the New Points Plus Family Plan for Walmart. This was delicious!!
Wow! The response to our NEW Points Plan has been huge today! Be sure to check out the posting schedule for any of our menu plans on the MEAL PLAN OPTIONS page on our site. (Our new Points Plan follows the same posting schedule as the original Points Plan.)
Loved the Couscous and Ham on the New Points Plan (publix) this week! Really good! We ate it with a salad instead and some bread...wonderful and very kid friendly. Note: If you get "flavored" couscous instead of plain you may want to omit the garlic salt.
Our friend, Jon Acuff (creator of blog and book, "Stuff Christians Like") generously shared some of his kitchen wisdom with us for our blog today!

30,000 FACEBOOK FRIENDS!!! Happy New Year to us!! We are so blessed to have you share in this journey... we hope to be a blessing in your life, too!
Just subscribed ~ great way to start a New Year!
Here's to hoping my family becomes less picky at the dinner table :) Just subscribed and am hoping all goes well when new dishes start to be placed on the table. We are in a dinner rut and these look amazing! My tastebuds and my pocketbook THANK YOU :)
I as well just subscribed! I am a mom who works full time and have tried meal planning, but only last a few weeks and is very overwhelming to me. I really hope this helps those feelings and allows a less stress at home!
just signed up! just hubby and I, but we're on our budget and looking for great new recipes. Decided to try the low-fat for two, and it all sounds amazing!
Just signed up! Excited to start saving (more) money! Thanks for having something like this!
I'm making the "So-Good Chicken Enchiladas" for supper tonight. I was wondering...do you think you could prepare them, then freeze them to be baked at a different date?
I want to subscribe but I am having trouble choosing which plan to use. We shop at hyvee or walmart and have me, my husband and two toddlers to feed. Would the any-store plan or walmart plan be cheaper? I'm thinking I will do the family plan, even though the two little ones don't eat a lot right now...my husband can take the leftovers to work. He works at the mall and we totaled up the month of dec. that he spent on mall food and it was OVER 200 dollars- on mall food!!! So we definitely need this...
Hi would like sign up but also not sure which plan. I shop Walmart but I am on a low cal 1200 cal a day diet, which plan is lowet in calories and do u think u will ever post nutrition break down? thanks soo much!
I printed the publix family plan for this week (with shopping list) and went to Publix today. The items on the meal plan list are not what are on sale at Publix. can you tell me if it makes a difference where you live? This wasn't mentioned on the website from what I could see. Thanks!
I just signed up for the Low Fat plan and am really excited about it!! I can see this saving me A LOT of time! Any tips to save even more money, without the hours of couponing?
I signed up today looking forward to saving money and having great well balanced meals at home! Have Your Poppyseed Chicken ready for after church can't wait!
Had my first e-mealz meal last night and it was awesome! Vegetarian Shepard's Pie? Yes, please! Yummy! I can't wait to try the next meal tonight!
Been using e-mealz for three years now and it takes the guesswork out of meal planning!! We love to eat-out and many times I just say "I have something planned for tonight" and we save the $$!! Not every meal is a home-run, but most are very good and I just keep the one's my family enjoys and make it again later...In fact, one of the meals (Greek Microwave Chicken I think it is called) has turned into a family favorite!! THANK YOU e-mealz...y'all are a BLESSING!!!
Just joined today after my friends suggested e-mealz! I feel bad tho - I didn't know they could have referred me and they could have got a "benefit" out of it :( Still yet! I'm pretty excited about trying this out!!
Does e-mealz have any plans that follow the nutrition plan from P90X?? For example phase 1 is the fat shredder and for my body type consits of servings of 7 proteins, 3 dairy, 1 fruit, 4 veggies, 1 fat, 1 carb, 2 snacks (plus a recovery drink & protein bar), and 2 condiments. I would love to take the guess work out of meal planning for this 90 day fitness/nutrtion plan. The book that comes with the plan has a full day menu plan for only 1 week!!
Been an e-mealz customer for a few years now. Just made the pot roast from my plan for this week. Out of this world good!! I don't know how you ladies do this. It has made me into the cook I never was and never would have otherwise been. Love e-mealz. Never stop!
Has anyone made the Oriental Chicken Slaw? It calls for slaw mix I was wondering if regular or would brocolli slaw mix work ok? Please help plan to make it tonight for supper. Thanks!
Just became members so excited!!! cant wait to start cooking something different for dinner!
Just oined today and made enchiladas. They were great! I love being able to feed my husband and myself as well as our 1year old the same food and feel good about what she is eating.
I've been using e-mealz for just over 3 months now and LOVE it! One thing I would love to see is the nutrition information for the Walmart low carb for 2 plan. Is it available some place? 
Just joined today and am looking forward to start in tomorrow! Will be shopping this evening. I only wish you could do a three meal, 1-2 snacks a day plan instead of just one meal. But dinner is the most hardest for me on deciding what to cook and this will greatly help me in that dept. Also, why only a 5 day plan? Why not 7?
I just have to say, I have been on the plan for a year now and I think it is TOTALLY AWESOME!! Not only am I saving money, but the food choices are yummy. Most of my family members love every meal I made. I say most of the family because my 6yr old son is a picky eater but he eats most of the meals. He isn't one for spicy foods and sauces so if I leave some without sauce or spice, he is fine. I do the walmart low fat plan for a family of 4.
AHH - I NEED HELP!! I just signed up today and first orderd the low-carb any store for 2 plan. Realized that I didn't want the for 2 but wanted the low-carb any store plan - the one that in the options has a sample menu for 7 days and feeds 4 people. So I went in and changed it (my one change for 3 months) and when I look at this weeks & last weeks menus there are only 4 days!!!!! I need one for 7. I'm really confused now! 
does anyone use e-mealz for kroger in the central ohio region? trying to figure out if the prices match up before we subscribe.. any input would be great!
I signed up today with the any store plan! Going shopping tomorrow afternoon. Looking to start the new year off healthy and saving money. I know my husband(the picky eater) won't eat some of the meals, so I can throw the old stand by's of spaghetti and sloppy joes every couple of weeks! I am glad that our little guy(1 year old) can eat what we eat every night! 
cheeseburger soup! delicious! my family and i are excited to see what what meals each week brings. thank you, e-mealz!
Made our second meal- Pan seared sausage. It was delicious and SUPER easy. My baby loved it too!
Made the So-Easy Chicken Enchiladas for dinner tonight but we used leftover Turkey instead of chicken and it turned out DELICIOUS!! My picky eaters absolutely loved it! 
Have any Dillons shoppers (preferably in KS) tried to use the Kroger plan to see if it lines up with Dillons' deals? 
Just signed up, so excited!!!!!
A friend just posted that she got this got this as a gift so I had to check it out. I'm trying out the Low Carb plan at Walmart but I always get my meat from another local store (Tru Buy) that has a great meat dept and I usually buy in bulk so we'll see how this works out. I'm really excited about not wondering what's for dinner tonight, every night and then deciding that I'm not prepared so it ends up pizza or fast food.
Okay, I am behind and am making the Beggar's Chowder on the Wal-mart plan from a few weeks ago. What do I do with the creamstyle corn? The directions never mention it! Thanks in advance!!
Hi! I tried contacting you via email but I'm not sure if it went through. I live in the Atlanta area and my Publix doesn't have some of the sales that you list on the weekly menu. There were several discrepancies. Do the items on the actual ad vary by region? I compared your list to my store's ad and the sale items were not on it. Thanks!
Wow, I just discovered E-Mealz two days ago. Where have you been all my life? I signed up, shopped for the week and made my first meal last night. Split Pea Soup w/Sausage. Fantastic! Thank you for this amazing service! I would love a Southern California store-specific (other than Walmart) list with Weight Watchers points.
once again.. i am failing at printing out my weekly menus. is there any way to get back copies?
I just joined & live in Northern California. The only store I have on your list is WalMart - but I don't have a super WalMart so no groceries anyway. Is there any chance of a "Raley's" shopping list?
I have a question regarding the french pork roast . I know it says to use a dutch oven , but is it cooked and simmered on the stove top the whole time ???? 
I just got married 3 months ago and this is what I try to do every weekend, but never seem to have the time!!! I found this over the holiday, and shopped for this week's meals just yesterday...so easy! This is exactly what I was looking for!! Thank you!!! I am telling my friends!
Has the weight watchers meal plan been updated to reflect their new way of calculating points? I have a friend who's intersted in E-mealz that does weight watchers. :-) 
I've been using E-Mealz for a little over a year now, and we LOVE it! My kids are constantly on the go, and before E-Mealz, we ate out way too often. I learned about your program from Dave Ramsey, and you have really helped with my budget. I'm a single parent, so I have to stretch every dollar. Thank you so much for helping me do just that!
I've only made 2 meals so far - changed each one just a bit, but they have been fabulous! The best part is we are trying new dishes and I don't have to think of what to make - coming up with what to cook is the hardest for me! It's been great!
I just switched to the New Points Plan and can't pull up the menu. Is anyone else having this issue?
I'm new to the service, would you be willing to add pictures? I'm a visual person and it would nice to see what the food looks like. 
Meal #3- Green Chicken Casserole with roasted asparugus and pita bread. Had to cook the asparagus a bit longer than the directions said but the meal was great!
My daughter just told me about this page. I do the "simply filling" from WW. Is there a menu plan for that?
I know this is bit of a repeat, anybody able to download the new PP for WW? Just tried and it's the old one I think.
Is anyone having difficulties logging in on the website? I have been trying for over a week and have sent numerous emails asking for help. I haven't received any feedback whatsoever. Do I have something blocked? Please help!
I just signed up for the Publix New WW Points plan. Cant wait for tomorrow to download my plan and go shopping!
Wondering if there will be a sample of the New Points Plus Family menu up soon? Considering a switch. My husband and I are counting calories and the Low Fat Wal-Mart plan is not always so low... 
I just learned about e-mealz last night at my Weight Watchers meeting and am considering subscribing. I was curious to know, though, can you access your e-mealz account and menus from different computers without locking up and terminating your account?
Unable to access the New Points System Wal-Mart Menu for families. I changed my plan type this morning and won't let me view. Get this message: Index of /mealplans/PointsSystem_New_Walmart Parent Directory Was supposed to head to grocery store today. Help please!
Loving e-mealz!! :) I have spinach manicotti in the crockpot right now. :)
I think it would have been nice to know the new points/walmart menu just isn't available yet - I emailed support earlier this morning & still had no answer until I came here... feeling discouraged & have been regretting my purchase all afternoon...
I just signed up for this and I am unable to view the meal plan. It brings up an index/mealplan/etc..... Please help!
LOVING this! I wasn't hip on a few of the meals (using Aldi for two for my 3yo and myself - so yes, lots of leftovers!), so I just substituted a few from your sample meals in and I have also been substituting the ingredients with Fit & Active and/or lower fat/calorie items. I am in LOVE with the Italian meatballs and I picked all the ingredients up from Aldi and it was a HEALTHY meal! I just measured out the egg noodles to not go overboard and used the Fit & Active turkey meatballs! THANK YOU for already adding AWESOME variety to my meals for myself and my daughter! Plus it's easy and makes GREAT leftovers!
just joined today and am VERY excited to do my shopping and get cooking! plus, by not having to spend time thinking about what to make and when to make it, and then making the grocery list, etc., it will be sooo much easier to stick with teaching my 15 year old daughter how to cook. :)
My boyfriend and I just went to the grocery store with our first list of the low-fat menu! We also cooked one of the meals tonight and I am forever changed! Grocery shopping was way cheaper and the meal wasy EASY and DELICIOUS! I love e-mealz! 
Day 4: Spicy Shrimp over potatoes. Delicious! Not as much left overs as normal, so I will take a plain potato and salad for lunch and my husband will eat the left overs. The meal was great!!
I just want to say thank you. I am being tested for Celiac's Disease and have to stay away from gluten. I had a hard time having to prepare 2 different meals. One for my husband & 2 kids, and another for myself. I almost started crying when i saw the menu...My whole family will be enjoying a gluten free life style with me without sacrificing yummy food! THANK YOU!!!! You made my crazy life a little easier for me and my family! I am spreading the word!!! Much love to you guys!!!
I just changed my plan to the New point plan for Walmart, but I can't get the link to work for this week or last weeks menu. HELP!
so i contacted customer service and have not heard back from them in 24 hours. I figured i would here back by now but since i haven't does anybody on here understand how the referall program works? I'd love to share this with everyone but if I can get some cash from it i'd rather do it that way!! 
Love this so far, only which I could get recipes w/o eggs since I'm allergic to them!!
Just signed up yesterday for the Family - any store plan. So far, I am pleased. Although I think I spent more than I normally do at the grocery, I feel that I actually have some good meals (not just junk food) ready to be made in my fridge. Yesterdays ham and brocolli pastry was easy to fix and tasted great (only my 9 year old who is pretty picky complained). I have the food! I have a plan! I don't have to guess what to make for dinner anymore! yeah!!! :)!!!
Just read that your customer service email isn't working on the site, so I'll let you know here. There's a funny and frightening mistake on this weeks Walmart family menu. On the Homemade chicken strips, it says you need 32+ lbs of chicken tenders. YIKES!! haha on the shopping list it's correct, but in the recipe it kind of scared me. ;) Just used my first menu last week and I loved it. Excited to go shopping for this weeks meals. I'm NEVER excited to go grocery shopping. Thanks for the great and effective meal plan!
I received a gift subscription to your meal plans. However, I need to change it to a two-person meal plan. When I try to change it on your site, the drop-down menu does not work. Can you help? I just read from another post that your customer service email is not working. Thanks!
2nd request! Do you have a "simply filling meal plan?" The "Points Plus" incorporate way too many points for us "Simply Filling Weight Watchers." Please advise ASAP! I'd like to get started today!
I don't know if this is allowed on here or not, so if it isn't I please just remove it, LOL. I have been using Emealz since 2008 and love about 90% of the recipes. What I would like to ask others is are you really getting out of the store cheaper. I have a family of four and spend approximately $200 a week between Publix and Walmart. This includes ALL shopping such as cleaning breakfast everything. Am I spending to much? Am I about right? I would really like to hear some feed back. 
I'm new to the service, would you be willing to add pictures? I'm a visual person and it would nice to see what the food looks like.
We just became a member! We are a family of 4 and are excited to try this! In hopes it will make things easier in our house at dinner time. We are signed up for the Low Fat plan. We live in California. I have seen different posting on here asking about if you guys are going to add a plan for Safeway. I was wondering if that was going to happen any time soon. The closest Walmart is about an hour away and the Ralph's is even farther away. Trying to keep the cost down on the Grocery Bill's. I Safeway plan would be great!! 
I just signed up last night on the Publix Plan here in NE Florida. But what would really be nice is a Winn Dixie plan. They have Fuel Perks rewards where you can save money on gas for your car by shopping there. I saved 50 cents PER GALLON on my gas last week using their rewards program. Some items you buy there earn you double-fuel perk points. It would be really great to save on groceries AND gasoline! Any plans on a Winn Dixie plan anytime soon?
The e-mealz website has a sidebar for entering your email address to receive a recipe for a low-fat chocolate layer dessert. I've entered two different email addresses and checked spam...no recipe.
Using points plan for 2 @walmart, two weeks now the prices have been wrong for almost half of the items listed. Is there a certain day I am supposed to shop to get the recommended pricing?
Dinner #5: Italian Wedding Soup. This has been my favorite this week. We are not big soup eaters, so we really thought this would not be satisfying, but even my picky husband seemed to love it. We scooped out some meatballs and pasta for the baby and she loved the cresent rolls that went with it. 
I just joined yesterday and I'm still not able to access the menus. I contacted customer support and still nothing. HELP please
Low fat Family plan for Kroger Please!
I joined E-Mealz in November and I have to say that you have the best meal plans I have come across. I own lots of recipe books that have been collecting dust. The Baked Ziti Supreme meal and the Salmon and Zucchini Bake meal were a hit with my family. The way you lay out the entire meal is awesome. I actually look forward to preparing dinner. I do have to confess though that I pick and choose the meals rather than following the meal plan for the entire week as it is layed out. It's worth the $5.00 membership fee I pay per month. Great Job!
Ok i think I'm gonna give this a try. All I need to know is if I would save more by going with the plan of a grocery chain, or do just as well with any store. The store I shop is not listed
I subscribe to the Low Carb "Any Store" Plan but this weeks is showing for "Walmart". I sent an email on Wed when it came out but hadn't received a reply yet. Just saw that there were some issues with email system? Are the meals the same or will this be corrected soon. Thanks
Thanks for the new points plus options. I've been looking forward to it all week. BUT it shows cantaloupe in one of the menus as 1 pt. Fruits are zero points on the new WW points plus. That makes me nervous about the other points values... I live for the E-mealz menus and follow them religiously. I don't want to have to re-calculate everything! Please tell me it was just an overlook and someone figured the rest right! Or do I need to change something?
Any plans for vegan options? Just wondering . . . 
Hi everyone. Does anyone have the meal plan for Dec 30. - Jan 5. I must have accidently tossed mine when I was throwing some other papers out. I need the Publix WW Points Plan. I really would appreciate it if you could email it to me. Please message me privatly and I will send you my email address.
I am looking at subscribing to the Low Carb meal plan for 2 - does anyone know if there are enough for lunch leftovers? I have gestational diabetes right now (and am limiting portions). I will be required to add some carbs, so I know it will need *some* modifications, just curious if anyone knows about the portion sizes. We are very good about eating next day leftovers. Thanks!
I am just starting with E-Mealz and am soooo excited, I've heard great things from my friends!
Ok. I promised to post about last nights meal (2nd meal I have fixed using e-mealz). It was Chicken and Mushroom Pasta (cooked in crock pot) with green beans and rolls. It was so easy to put together and it was sooooo tasty. We all enjoyed it (except my picky 9 yr old who didn't eat all of his but at least he ate about half :)!). Thanks e-mealz for taking the guesswork out of dinner!!!
just wondering the cost for the week on the low-fat and low-carb plans???
I had just switched to the WW points plan a few days before the NEW points plan was announced. I just joined WW again and am hoping to switch to the new points plan but would really hate to be charged for the change (since only one change is allowed per billing cycle) 
Does the referral program have an option to refer via Facebook and still be able to track where/who the referral comes from? I notice they have options for regular emailing and for Myspace but I didn't know if it would work the same otherwise. Facebook referrals would seem to work great. Thanks!
did i miss something, or was the shopping list for the any store-low fat missing the cauliflower for the soup?
I wish there was a WW New Points plan for Kroger! I'm having such a hard time figuring out which plan to sign up for. Is anyone doing the WW New Points plan and shopping at Kroger or Harris Teeter that could give me an estimate of the weekly cost?
Our family has enjoyed e-mealz immensely! We have a soon-to-be 15yr. old boy and an 11yr. old girl. Neither of them are picky eaters, so this works out perfect for us! I love e-mealz for the peace of mind, and knowing that I'll have everything I need to fix dinner each night! My big pet peeve is scrounging to come up with something, and e-mealz eliminates this problem for us! 
I got a great surprise in the mail the other day - an affiliate check!! I have posted the link to your site on my Facebook page a few times and I guess it paid off! I also have a request - would you consider a Publix low-fat meal plan for 2? We are currently using the Publix Meal Plan for 2 and I'm modifying it a bit with low fat ingredients, but I'd love to see you guys offer one!!
just signed up, ready to go shopping without wondering what I am getting!
I just signed up too! My sister has been using your plan for years...figured it was time to get on board!
We have our 1st baby on the way and are trying to find as many ways as possible to save money for upcoming expenses (Child Care, Delivery Costs, increased insurance premium)...we found your link on Dave Ramsey's site and signed up the same night for the Publix for 2 plan. Can't wait to see how much we start saving?!!
I just signed up for the any store family plan after seeing the link on the Dave Ramsey site. Hopefully this can save me $ and TIME!! I am so tires of trying to think of NEW meals for the family!
just a heads up if your on the low-fat any store plan the frozen cauliflower isn't listed in the shopping list.
I saw one customer post that you can subscribe to more than one plan per week, does that mean you will be doubling the cost as well or do you have access to the other plans at no charge since you subscribe to another. I shop regularly at 3 different stores depending on the deals offered. I don't want to have to be loyal to one store...
I just joined your site, looking forward to saving some time and money. I go to the grocery store about 4 x a week because I can never make up my mind and I'm on WW so I try to keep it healthy.. I'm so glad to see you have the points plus program! Hopefully this will start to make shopping/planning easier! Thanks!
Honestly, I just don't know which plan to sign up for! Low cal, reg, or what! Do you go shopping for the coupons to go with the plans?
Just joined... love it already ...... thank you, thank you, thank you for making my dinner planning and grocery shopping easy and simple!!!! 
Thank you for what you do! I am a new mother and before her my husband and I usually ate dinner out somewhere after the gym. Once my daughter started eating table foods and I was back to work, dinner was so stressful for me that I just avoided it and we continued to eat out. I didn't want my daughter to be raised to have dinner in a resturaunt but I just didn't know what to do. I was at a total loss when it came to planning dinner. I prayed for God to help me get this area of our lives organized and together. Praise God for e-mealz!! God Bless you and your families :) 
A while ago, there was a crock pot recipe for turkey breast on the Walmart plan for two. It involved one packet of onion soup mix, and 1/2 c. of orange juice (and maybe some pepper?). I thought I had that saved, but I can't find it anywhere, and I was wanting to make it for tomorrow. Can anyone help? I can't remember what all went in the mix that goes on top of the turkey, and I can't remember how long to cook it. Any help is appreciated! It was SO good!
Just signed up again. My 15 year old daughter cooks dinner in our house (for money of course) and I just hate menu planning. So I know this is what we need! Back on WW again after gaining back 30 of the 40 I lost. So far so good, down 3 pounds!
Started the WalMart for Two last week. As I live alone, one meal for dinner and the other for lunch at work! I just love taking control, don't you? The recipes have been delicious, too!
I just started E-Mealz and WW today. I'm on the new WW pointsplus program for 2 at any store. The hamburger bun for meal 1 was not at the store I shop at. In a case like this, how do I know what to substitute it with??? 
Anyone else attempt to by Jimmy Dean Turkey Sausage and it was $13.97 for 12 links??? On the new points program for 2 at any store.
Hi, Before I join, I was wondering how this works in Alaska? We generally don't have the same prices or options the lower 48 has. Thanks.
I canceled my next renewal to try another plan but want e-mealz back! Can I just renig on my cancellation?
I just signed up for the ww new points plus plan, any store. I use the price list from yourgrocerysaver dot com but would love to know how much the rest of you are spending per week on this plan. Thanks! Can't decide if I should switch to the Wal-Mart plan. Really wish this plan was available for Kroger! 
really considering signing up for Emealz, but i shop primarily at Trader Joes and Stater Brothers. Would I still benefit from the program shopping these stores getting the new WW list? 
Making the Spicey Black Bean Soup from New Points System for 2. I doubled the recipe Ds and Family is stay with us between moves from old house to new house. I put it in the crock pot though. And so that it wouldn't get watered down. I use the trick for making a cake in the crock pot cover first with paper towel and then cover with lid. Smelling yummy.
Just signed up last week and did my shopping thursday. Its now monday night and i STILL have dinners planned up until wed! feels sooo good! AND i was UNDER budget!
i am not able to pull up the menu for this weeks low carb plan! i need to cook dinner....does anyone have the weeks plan printed that can send me the menu and recipe for the, i believe, its the italian chicken with steamed broccoli?
Help - a few weeks ago I found an awesome vegetable soup recipe on e-mealz. I printed out that week's meal plan but can't find it anywhere and I really want to make the soup again. Does anybody else have the recipe? I do the Publix family meal plan.
got a quick question...I'm making the cheeseburger soup...it calls for one can of chicken broth. WHAT SIZE??? How many ozs...it doesn't say?!?!?!?!?! help!!! I'm in process right now!!!
I'm going to switch plans, over to the new ww points plan. I don't know whether I should do Walmart, or the 'any store' plan though, and the 'any store' doesn't have a sample yet. I want to do the 'any store', but it just doesn't seem too specific to my weekly ads consistently. Thoughts? I wish there were more specific stores like Walmart!
Waiting for payday on the 15th to jump back on the E-Mealz wagon :-( I want to be sure I can always have my automatic renewal and things just got really tight (I know, $15 is not much, but sometimes it is). I guess patience is a virtue, but I've been in E-Mealz withdrawal...
For anyone making the Chicken Velvet Soup, can you substitute chicken broth for chicken stock??? Would appreciate any help!!! :)
I just made the Smoked Chicken Chili from the Oct 28 menu. It is delicious as promised! I think that could made in the crock pot, but still didn't take alot of prep. That one could be a repeat offender!! LOVED IT
I just subscribed and I am looking at this weeks meal plan. I was hoping you could tell me what chili sauce is...is that like green pepper sauce or red pepper sauce or tobasco sauce??? Please help! THanks so much! I love seeing all the posts and your guys' timely responses too! I'm so excited to try this!
HI I am so excited to have found you..... I signed up and get my first plan tomorrow. My question is.... Is there a time that you update each week or is it random? 
We've been using this site for almost a year now! Love it love it love it. One wish would be for you to put nutritional guidelines on the meals. We're trying to watch our protein intake and it takes a lot of time to figure that all in. 
I'm trying to decide which plan to go with. Will the family meals feed a family of 5 (that included 2 teenage boys)? Also are the low fat meals good? I'm stuck between Wal Mart and Publix. Any opinions greatly appreciated :)
I just signed up for E-Mealz and did my first shopping trip. I signed up for the Walmart for 2 list, but ended up doing my shopping at my local Price Chopper because I felt I usually get good deals there... unfortunately I ended up spending about $70, which is right around my budget, though the plan aimed for around $40. I was hoping to save more than that. I plan on switching to actually shopping at Walmart next week and hope this helps...
For meal #6 for this weeks aldi plan(the ham salad), I was wonderin if I can add elbow macaroni to it and hom much? 
Hey! Just stumbled upon the e-mealz website and joined. Is there a reward program for referring friends?
Made the Peasant Beef Casserole from the low-carb plan tonight. The recipe said 275 for 5 hours in the oven. I put it in the crock pot instead on low for 6 hours. It worked great and my family LOVED IT. I'm really looking forward to tomorrow and the new menu!!
I have a quick question....I am trying to make Turkey Pot Pie Pasta from the family lowfat any store menu. It calls for 1 lb turkey breast fillets. I have looked at 2 different stores for them and even asked store employees and they said they don't have that product...has anyone been able to find them? I'm sure I can just substitute chicken breast in the recipe.
I have recently joined and am doing the lowfat Publix meal plan. Is anyone else using this one and how are you liking it?
I just joined last night & printed out the menu for the Publix 2 person today. I'm loving the coupon section. But am wondering what "water rolls" are. Are they like spring rolls in the frozen section or are they bread? Any ideas? 
Just wondering if 10 T of butter and flour is the correct amout in Kroger plan's Smoked BBQ burritos? That just seems like a lot. 
Just wanted to say thank you. We have enjoyed the meals this week. Snow Jam 2011 has been a yummy one. 
I haven't joined yet - just heard about you. Any thoughts on making plans for Safeway or Harris-Teeter stores? I realize I could use the Any Store plan, but it would be more cost effective to have menus that target sale items.
Just wondering, if anyone knows, are the Kroger ads generally the same across the region. I am in MS and that is not one of the states listed but that is where I like to shop. And I LOVE the idea of the menus incorparating the sale items. Thanks!!
Mexican Meatloaf on the Points Plus Family Plan was amazing! I was thinking that it would be dried out, but it really wasn't. Who would have guessed that four ingredients could work together to be so delicious and so healthy? You hit a home run with this one, Emealz!
I loved the Chicken & Sausage gumbo from the points plus family plan! We had it last night for dinner and it was even better today for lunch! You've made weight watchers so much more easier for me and my family!
I just started but am really looking forward to trying all the meals. It just might slim my cost down AND give me something to cook when I'm tired and can't imagine WHAT to cook! Yippee!!!
Have the points plans been adjusted to the new points plus plan for Weight watchers or should I be re-figuring the points for each meal?
Really enjoying my meals this week. Great job and thanks for offering G-Free meals! It makes my new nutrition plan easier!! Appreciate it!!
Just joined and I couldn't find New points plus plan: Publix for 2. Only Wal-mart and any store... 
Why does the new points plus plan have only 5 days of menus? Just wondering.
Just finished our first week on the low fat family plan and we loved it! I think my favorite was the baked chicken spaghetti. Unfortunately living Puerto Rico I am not sure how much savings we are seeing, but it sure has made my life easier. Luckily we are moving back to TX this summer and we will have Krogers again!
Just starting e-mealz and couponing. Has anyone on the low-fat plan come up with a list of frequently used e-mealz items I can stockpile when they go on sale?
just bought my first week of groceries on the new points for 2 at any store... went to publix and it was $63... hoping to bring that total down by getting back into coupons. I really don't want to change stores but I may try walmart even though I don't like shopping there.... wanted to be around the $45 range with this plan
Just joined. WW old plan any store. My daughter has nut, seafood, and egg allergies.....will this be a problem with my menus?
Made the pasta fagioli last night and it was DELISH. We're hanging on to that recipe for sure. :)
I just want to be clear in the Points plus system now the points menu? 
Loved the baked potatoe with brocolli and cheese. Soooo easy, my son could make it himself. Came home from work, and he asked if he could have that for dinner again!
I just want to publicly tell you that your customer service is wonderful! Thank you for providing such a great service.
Love this service!!! Would like pictures. I just made the Ham & Broccoli Pastry and couldn't figure out the crescent dough placement. Hmmm ...
cranberry chicken on WW old menu - awesome - family enjoyed it! 
Thinking of signing up ~ We do not have a Grocery WalMart in Fresno, CA or any other store listed in menu options... WE do have Foods Co - which Ralphs owns --- So, E-Mealz - Do you know if your menu/grocery list (specifically the Sales) would be the same at a Foods Co??? I know you have an option to shop ANY store - but I want to stay true to budget! Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. 
Just checked menu for WW PointsPlus for next week....fabulous!
is there any customizing to your meal plan? like if you cant eat shrimp or spinach? 
Just signed up for emealz today--- and the food sounds great
I have updated my credit card info 3 times and still shows inactive subscription - I did send an inquiry via the contact link on the website several days ago and still have not gotten a response, is the website having difficulties. My daughter updated her cc info as well and said that hers is also showing inactive subscription. Is anyone else having this problem? My daughter and I both have used the e-mealz plan for a couple of years and love it - we just haven't been able to access our menu plans for a few weeks now. Thank you!
I have a question my renewal is due tomorrow i want to begin it doing another plan.. But i want to make sure I still have the option to change back to my old one if I don't like the new one... Can I do that?
Are the weekly menus for the old WW and the new points plus pretty much the same, with just different point calculations?
My son shared your site with me and I signed up immediatley. I love this idea, I used to do something similiar on my own when I was raising my children. It saved me time and money then and now it is even better having someone else plan the meals. Never to old to use a good service, thanks!
love, love, love e-mealz! The most challenging hours in my home with three young children has been transformed thanks to your service. 
Ending week 2 of e-mealz and still completely staisfied. I love the variety. There have been a few meals that we had our family recipes for and use ours instead, and a few meals we have changed for out tastes, but have tried to stick to the meals listed. we are very happy and we have not eaten oout since the start of the month. 
Just started one week ago. So far I have made 2 of the meals. Don't like all the recipes, but I know in time I will have my faves to choose from. Good concept. I hope I renew in 3 months.
I am not a fan of pork (except bacon). Can I substitute chicken for pork in recipes? 
Question??? I am having a hard time choosing what plan to pick. I am an extremely picky eater. I read earlier that the low fat plan is easier for picky eaters, is that true? BTW I won't eat fish.
We LOVE the low carb for 2 plan! Thank you so much! I really appreciate the affordability as well. Keep the great meals coming!
We love emealz - wishing for an App!
Just to let you know, here in Atlanta, the Kellogg's corn flakes were not BOGO and I had to buy Publix instead. (other Kellogg's cereals were though) and the tuna was "chunk light" tuna, not "white" tuna as it is listed. (which for me was a difference b/c I prefer the white kind) Just a heads up...
I just made my first e-mealz dinner for my family tonight (we are doing the new Points plan for Weight Watchers) and it was a HUGE hit, much loved by my picky-eater husband! Thank you soooo much! 
I just completed my first week and love e-mealz! Thank you for making meal planning so much easier for me. I wondered why only 5 meals, now I know, we get to eat left-overs on the last two days! Yummm!!!
Just signed up, got my menu and cant wait to go shopping tomorrow. So great that someone has prepared my menu for the week dont even have to guess whats for dinner !! LUV the concept hope it works for me :)
Not sure if I want to do Aldi or Walmart. I don't shop at Aldi but have friends that do and they say they save I just don't want to end up at Walmart anyways for stuff that Aldi's dose not have.
I have a recommendation.. I so far am loving this service.. I think it would be so much easier if you could email the plans to the members rather than us having to log in each week and check it.. just some food for thought
Just signed up ! So excited. My husband and I have such a hard time planning for 2 ! We were curious as to why the meal plan for 2 only went for 5 days instead of 7 ?
Does the money saver menus that follow the weekly sales take into consideration calories and fat? I want to sign up for the Emealz program to save money, but I do not want to sacrifice our waistlines. Please let me know what I need to do. Just trying to make the best decision and plan for my family. Thanks. 
Has anyone made the Creamy Basil & Tomato Pasta from the Points System-Any Store menu? We're going to be having it tomorrow night and I'm reading through the instructions and I feel like there are steps missing. I'm going to chill the cream cheese & tomatoes and then combine it with the dressing and hot noodles??? Am I right? Any help would be appreciated! 
I try to print out the menus in case I want to repeat a recipe, but I didn't for one and I would love to get the recipe for the beef stew. It was SUPER simple with beef, onion, carrot, peas and mushrooms, but I can't remember what the base was...and I want to make it today. Anyone have that recipe or is there a way to get it through the website??
Are there a lot of pork dishes in the regular plan? We don't eat pork but aren't vegetarian either.
Maybe someone can help...I just signed up again and when I print the lists the ingredients do not show up. Everything else is there but each ingredient section will not print. I tried to highlight and print but that didnt fix it either. Has anyone experienced this and how do I fix it?
made the rio grande soup tonight! AWESOME. I was hoping for some leftovers for lunch tomorrow. No such luck as the family devoured it! THANK YOU!!!!
I have a question about the WW recipes....for example, the spaghetti with turkey meatballs recipe....it just says spaghetti noodles. What kind and what brand really affect the points! So how do I know which one it is that they used to calculate the points??
Any thought to putting nutritional information and/or serving size to the menus? I'm on the low carb family plan and I'd like to have that information readily available so I can better keep track of what I am eating. Serving size alone would be a huge help. Thanks!!
have tried the molassas pork tenerloin and the pasta e fagioli...AMAZEBALLS! and my 17yr old made the latter...at least now I know he won't starve when he goes away to college!
Just made the Pork chops, apples, pecans and brown sugar.. my family devoured it....it was only enough for three people... they want it again tomorrow night!
Greek Chicken was so yummy!! 
i'm interested in knowing which plan you think is the healthiest? (meaning, least processed food, sugars, etc.) i'm going to sign up... but i can't decide which way to go! your opinion is appreciated! thanks in advance :) 
pizza loaf was outstanding! and I loved the salad with it!
cranberry chicken rocks !!!!
Just signed up for the new points menu and the recipes look delicious! 
I'm considering subscribing for a family meal plan but not sure which one to choose. My hubby was given a Mediterranean meal-type diet plan from the dr. yesterday...but he is a picky eater. Should I try for a regular family plan or low-carb/low-fat option?
I love saving money! You all rock! I've been shopping at Aldis for awhile but serving the same meals again and again and now I have fresh ideas. The black bean soup was perfect. Keep up the awesome work!
the Island Chicken went over well. I always feel like the best mom/wife when I can provide something we enjoy eating. I'm my own worst critic, so if I enjoy it, then it's well worth the effort. This one is a keeper.
Luv E- Mealz - we had mexican meatloaf tonight and my picky husband liked it even said he would eat it again . once he tries things he likes it :) 
Just downloaded this and last weeks menu...Can't wait to get started.
the sausage and rice dish in this week's low fat any store calls for "12 oz frozen seasoning blend" in the frozen food section...what is this?
I've been a member for a couple of month's and absolutely love it. I have been drooling over a few pictures on here and was hoping someone can help. Does anyone have the recipes for the Arabian Rice, Breakfast Pizza and Taco Cornbread Bake????? They are pictured in the photo albums and I really want to try them....Thanks!!! 
If the plans are organized around a certain store's weekly sale ads...what day are you suppose to start the weekly plan? I will be shopping at Kroger, there ad prices start on Wednesday. What day will I print the plan and what day should I shop?
I'm on week 2 of my e-mealz and I'm really enjoying it! We LOVED the orange pancakes! I'm really enjoying having more options for dinners! I signed up for the 7-day family plan because I wanted 7 meal options (not just 5)...of course I'm still working out sizing the meals down for just the 3 of us. Any plans to make a 7-day plan for smaller families? This still works great though...I usually make 2 of the meals serve as leftovers so a one-week plan sometimes lasts me 9-10 days!
Starting week four of shopping tonight! I can not tell you the stress e-mealz has taken away from me. I know what to shop for, I know that i'll get everything for the WHOLE WEEK. In the past I've gone to make something for dinner and think "oh it'd sure be nice if I had this or that" Now with E-mealz I DO!!! My menu comes out on Thursday, and that just so happens to be the day I have the MOST time to do my grocery shopping. Perfect Match! I tell everyone I talk to about this plan. I'm thinking of giving the "anystore menu for two" to my parents and inlaws. They are both empty nesters, and have a hard time cooking for JUST TWO. 
Just printed my first 2 weeks of low-carb meals for my family. I am so excited by all the yummy recipes and can hardly wait to begin trying them out! :o)
I subscribe to the Low Fat Anystore plan. Is the Low Fat Walmart plan the same menus? Or different....
I am using the low-fat Publix menu plan. If I decide to use real eggs instead of the egg substitute, how do I convert the measurements from cups to eggs?
I am really enjoying our E-Mealz plan... we had Mexican meatloaf tonight with green beans... I added brown rice on the side for the carb-lovers in our family... it is so nice to have the shopping list and menu made up for the whole week...:)
Made Country French Chicken & Vegetables with a Cranberry Pecan Green Salad for dinner and Chocolate Layer Dessert. It was easy, healthy, and my hubby & kids are happy:) Thank you E-Mealz! (I'm using the New Points Plan for Walmart)
I was wondering if there was any thought of putting all of your crockpot recipes from each meal plan together in one file? (So, all Points crockpot recipes together, all low carb crockpot recipes together)... I just started working and I need as any simple crockpot recipes as possible!!! This 6:30pm dinner time is making me struggle!!!
Thank you, E-Mealz!!!! I have Celiac Disease and work 60 hours a week. Cooking, shopping, and meal-planning is VERY difficult for me with my limited time and very limited diet. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for the gluten-free menus. They are WONDERFUL. Helps my husband and I eat healthier and at home nearly all the time these days. It really makes dinner time such a lovely experience, instead of being a super stressful time. (I'm used to coming home at 9 PM and thinking, "Oh no... what to make for dinner?") The meals are fast and easy. My husband has loved every single dish. The menus fit our weekly food budget exactly (I had two dollars to spare last week!), and the ingredients are simple. I couldn't be happier. Keep it up!!!
Tonight's Dinner... Creamy sausage and angel hair pasta w/ garlic toast. EXCELLENT! No hassle dinner. We LOVE E-Mealz
Making the Eggplant Bake tonight (WM Low Carb plan). We don't have a microwave, what alternate method can I use to cook the eggplant?
We just had the pepperoni roll tonight! It was great! We haven't found one single meal that wasn't a winner! I feel like I have hours added to my day and more time to homeschool my 5 kids, thank you so much Emealz!!!!
Just found e-mealz today. I'm so excited to go shopping tomorrow, and have a menu for a whole week that follows my weight watchers and I can cook for just my husband and I. Thanks!
We signed up a few weeks ago and so far we're really enjoying it. It's made life much simpler. One question though - why all the mayo in recipes? So far I'm just substituting sour cream for the mayo and I think it's working pretty well. My family doesn't eat mayo so hopefully the sour cream trick will keep working.
Another successful meal - lemon pepper catfish , steamed potatos and sweet and sour carrots - thumbs up from the hubby and myself !! 
I just signed up today and w/ me and my daughter on Weight Watchers, this couild be the time saver I've been looking forward!!!! Very excited!
I started e-mealz this past week. I thought I'd get some flack from the family b/c of the variety (they are so white bread!). However, my oldest daughter was SO excited about the change... We're doing the NEW Points menu - and the healthy menus are just amazing. Things I would never have thought about adding to the menu... but it has gone over GREAT!
Just started emealz yesterday for the points systems menus. Saw one from January 7 was the sample to view with stuffed potatoes. Is there any way to get that recipe along with the chicken vegetable soup?
Wow! Just made White Bean Chili from this week's low fat for two menu! So, so good! Served 3 for lunch easily! I'll make it again & double it for leftovers. A favorite for sure! 
ON the Low Fat Walmart Plan for this week, Meal # 4 has "1 pkg frozen seasoning blend" what is frozen seasoning blend?
Thank you so much for this service!! I have always planned my meals out ahead of time but I so appreciate it going with what is on sale. My husband and son love the food. We are doing the Points Plus plan because I am a weight watcher but I feel like I am feeding my family healthier than I ever have. Thanks again!
My husband and I have just joined in on Financial Peace university at our church and ran across this wonderful site of E-mealz. Although I am better at on hands when trying to make that decision on how to go about it and not miss up. Ok I feel I need someone to take me under their wings and get me started and then I will go all out. I am a busy woman (Personal Trainer) and need healthy meals to serve me and my husband. Can anybody give me a hand at this. Thanks, Yvonne Burrows
I think the chips and the cheese should be switched on "Chicken Chipper Casserole." The directions say to layer the chips in with the chicken & soup and then put all the cheese on top. I followed the directions, thinking it was odd that the chips weren't on top. Mine came out with dry, crusty cheese and soggy chips. I think it would be yummier with the cheese mixed in and a layer of toasty, crunchy chips on top.
About to make the Baked tacos (lowfat for 2) Does not say what temp to bake it at? All it says is "bake 25-30 mins" Help!
I see alot of questions about the store and the sale ad corosponding with there local store. I think that the ads are a small portion of the convience and savings of e-meals . for me the peace of mind of the menu, shopping list and new reciepes are priceless ..no mater what the sale ad is !!! Just my opinion , I luv emealz 
So which is the best menu for trying to lose weight? I'm so confused...low fat, low carb, or points plus???? 
Do you have G-free menus for Kroger? Also are your meals simple and somewhat basic? I have a picky eater who is also egg free. Thanks!
A friend sent me the info on e-meals. It looks great, however, even though the meals are healthy, I don't see any nutritional info mentioned on it. I keep track of Calories, protein, carbs, etc. Am I overlooking this somewhere?
I love E-mealz and have been a member for just over a year. However there have been a lot of soups lately. I have to push the family to eat soup so often. Otherwise, the meal variety has been such a huge help for us. 
Just signed up and went shopping today! Really excited and nervous to try out the recipes through the week. I have two kids 4 and 2 and not sure how they will feel about the new meals. My little girl seems excited, but we will see when I put it on her plate. 
If I sign up for one plan, say, Low Fat...could I then switch over to the Points Plus if I decide I need a change???
I am cooking the asparagus from last weeks meal #1. The recipe said to put it in the broiler to cook. My question is: if I have a broiler that cooks at either high or low, which one would I set the oven on if I'm cooking the asparagus? 
Second night making emealz. Recipe 1 was a hit! Making the cajun shrimp & rice tonight & was wondering if I was supposed to use the seasoning mix included in the rice box. Does anyone know?
I lost a favorite recipe from e-mealz. I know it had pork chops in the crockpot and served over egg noodles but can't remember the rest of the ingredients. Can anyone help?
So has anybody else shared emealz with everyone they know and noone has signed up for it?? I don't get it why would anybody not want to sign up for emealz!! I love them!! Just curious if it's just me or rather just my friends who aren't as pumped for this site as i am?? :) 
I signed up this week, and tonight I just made the smoky orange chicken, to be honest, I am a little scared of how it may taste....anyone wish to share their reviews?
Could you suggest to the writer of the WW new points menus that they always put a serviing size with each dish? I had no idea how much to serve of the sausage potato dish tonight. 
When will the sample menu for the WW for 2 be up? I'm considering changing. Thanks e-mealz! You're the best!
Just made my first meal from emealz! It was great and how nice it was not to have to plan out my menu! Yeehaw!
Made the Spinach Fettuccine last night and my 10-year-old daughter had 2 huge bowls of it. She's NEVER eaten spinach before and loved it! Even better, my husband (who is a twig) could not believe it was WW-friendly. It tasted SO GOOD!
I just found the site and am very interested in joining. Do you include the nutritional information for each meal in the menu plans? Sorry if this has already been addressed - like I said, I am new and was wondering about the nutritional info (specifically calories, carbs, and fat). Thanks so much!
Just wondering what meals plans people use and have really liked the recipes from. I am using the any store meal plan currently and there have some been some ok recipes but mostly I feel like they are just generically cheap recipes. I love the idea of e-mealz, but want to love the recipes too. 
In this week's walmart low fat plan, it says meals 2 and 5 call for cream cheese. Yet I only see it in #5...are one of the cheeses listed in meal 2 supposed to be cream cheese?
Is anyone else having trouble logging in?
What area of the country are the approximate prices based upon? When Walmart has a sale, is it nationwide or regional? Love the plan but I am spending much more than the initial information I received so trying to make changes. Thanks~
So for the Aldi plan this week, I guess I have a comment. I followed the directions for the slow cooker chicken and stuffing and it actually was done before 6 hrs and the broccoli and stovetop was very mushy. I definately will not put them in at the same time as the chicken if I make it again.
I've been doing the e-mealz for 6 days now...we were out of town a few days and so I have only made 3 of the Wal-Mart low-fat meals, but they were all pretty good! How fun to have the shopping list prepared, be able to quickly get dinner around, and not have to think about it! What a Godsend!
Just joined tonight while hosting my 9th FPU class. So cool that you have the New WW points plan!!!
I just realized that if we want the new Points Plus plan we need to switch it online. I kept wondering why my points didn't match up.
Anyone care to share their thoughts on the Low carb-Walmart menu? I am thinking about switching but I am afraid to because I won't be able to switch back for 3 months. I am actually trying to feed my family a more "Paleo" style and I am trying to find recipes and ideas that I can incorpoate for my family. (husband and two growing teens)
Signed up for the WW New Points Plan - 6 servings and the three of us...me, my husband and 17 year old son...usually finish the meal with no leftovers. I dont really count points (although I probably should) and I was wondering if the low fat plan would work better in terms of amount of food. I am happy with the recipes but wondering if we are eating too many calories. 
Made the Smokey Orange Chicken last night. Got some odd looks from my husband when I told him what was in it (not things we normally eat). It was AWESOME! Just the right touch of sweetness to it (I had canned my own marmalade this past summer) and the rice/green beans evened everything out nicely. Definitely making again, can't wait to use the leftover chicken for the quesadillas.
Just a note for the Braised Steak and Veggies meal on the Points Plus Family Plan. I forgot to get the Italian diced tomatoes, so I put in some of the leftover Smoky Tomato Soup and it was DELICIOUS! 
Any plans on offering a low-fat or low-carb option for Aldi's?
I'm hoping the points plus menus get more creative. I thought last weeks (360) was pretty lame. Spaghetti and frozen turkey meatballs? Really? I'm glad I didn't have to use all of them. The braised steak with veggies this week was great though.
is there anywhere to get nutrition info on the recipes?
I was told about this awesome website service by a friend and after two weeks have referred a friend! Where else can you spend $5 a month to have someone figure out creative dishes with such variety and that please almost everyone in the family???
My family had Pasta e Fagoli tonight from last week's Lowfat for 2 (Any Store) menu. I love how the writer includes so many vegetables in her menus! Thank you!
I absolutely love E-Mealz! We are on the meal plan for 2 (Any Store). I'm not the best cook and my husbend is a picky eater. Since using E-Mealz, my husband now compliments me on my cooking! I think he is happy I am not making the same old boring stuff all the time. We really like the variety and the meals are all very good and easy to make. Cooking used to be a dreaded thing for me and now I actually look forward to cooking every night! 
I just watched on Better Nashville and found the E-Mealz web site. It looks very interesting and would help may be a bit better organized. I think I would be more interested in subscribing if there was nutritional information given. 
Is there a store plan that is close to Homelands weekly sales. I know there is an any store plan but I coupon shop sales at homeland and will only buy the weekly sale items.
The plan is great and perfectly budgeted, but I cannot bring myself to cook my meal in a microwave. That's just awful. 
Just joined the new points plus for Publix! 
Just signed up after seeing E-Mealz on Better Nashville. Looks like a great idea. I signed up for the any store plan, but can I use the Kroger plan even though it is not for Nashville?
I'm trying to decide if e-mealz is something that I should do for my family. We have special dietary needs (No Dairy, No Wheat, and No Eggs) and I'm not sure if you can accommodate but I REALLY want to try.
I just moved to Florida from Georgia. Are they on the same plan or do I need to change states?
Thank you E-Mealz!!! Just had the LOW COUNTRY BOIL!! It was AWESOME!!! The kids ate the sausage corn and potatoes, while we ate the shrimp onion corn and potatoes. All for well about 15 dollars.
We have been trying the E-mealz for just about a month. So far so good! We live in CA and don't have any of the stores you have plans for near us. We are on the Ralph's family plan. But the close is Ralph's store is in So Cal. (about 8 hours away) We can get most of what each recipes call for at our local Safeway. But... the total bill is much higher than what is estimated. Do you guys plan on adding any other stores from California. Like Safeway, Whole Foods, Trader Joes??? 
We sure would love to see the calorie and nutritional information for your recipes. That sure would help keeping track for those of us dieting.
More photos of the meals would probly help sell this meal plan. It really helps to see what a meal is going to look like. We are going to have the Garlic Meatloaf tonight.
Just joined the family plan very excited to get started... very busy single mom, and dinner has always been a stressful time : ( I now see a light : ) thank you!
I love E-mealz! Never have to worry what I'm going to make for dinner, just look at my list and pick one out. For two full time parents and 2 tweens I can't thank you enough!
There was a recipe a few weeks back on the points menu that was made with chicken and cranberry sauce. I have lost my menu from that week. Would you be able to provide that recipe again? Thanks! I love e-mealz. It has made my life so much easier.
Well I just joined...I am going to the grocery store today to get items for two meals. Then the new menu will be availbale. I think this will be a great start to my saving money. I will only buy what's on the list and allow myself ONE cheat item of my choice not on the list! Thanks for all you do!
Thank you for your service. I feel like such an empowered mom! Even if my kids don't eat everything, it gives them a consistency that Mom is fixing something different every night. BTW, add meatball subs to your menu. I did that on a Friday night and they think I'm the bomb! 
I just joined. going to grocery store tonight to get what i need. im so excited about this. cant wait to start saving even more money.
Are you going to update your prices on the lists? We just joined and went to Wal-Mart with our list. We spent more than the estimated prices. Is it because the price list is a bit out of date?
DH turned me on to e-mealz I LOVE it!!! I am a planner and in the past before grocery shopping I would always have trouble making sure to get EVERYTHING on the list for each meal. Emealz is a no-brainer. I made the spicy tilapia for family dinner (with my parents and my sis & her hubby) this past Sunday and it was a HIT! I love that we can have a very healthful menu that isn't boring and doesn't break the pocketbook! Thank YOU!
Apple Pecan Porkchops from the Weight Watchers Publix menu - yummie!

We just had Chef's Requested 100 calorie steaks with eggs, home fries and biscuits for brunch here at home,it's the first time we ever ate ur steaks,4 of us say...AWESOME!!!We loved them.. no leftovers..:)
I can't wait for the Oklahoma weather to warm up so I can grill my bacon wrapped filets.. Has anyone ever tried to cook them on a George Foreman grill or someway inside, if so, how did they turn out and what should I do?
Just found the 100 calorie steaks on sale at Bi-Lo and had a $1.00 coupon... Awesome deal. I love these steaks. I just wish they carried the bacon wrapped filets.
went and got some steaks today....yummy!!
Just curious as to when we can expect our coupons from the New Year's Eve party?!?! Looking forward to some FREE steak!
Just made a trip to Albertson's to get a package of those yummy filets and they were out!!! Had my mouth all set for one...drats. Told the man in the meat dept they needed to hurry up and get more in and that I'd definitely be back. Guess it's chicken for supper tonight. L
eating flat-iron steaks tonight!!! and the best part...hubby is cooking!! :)
Got my coupon and used it for the Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon. Thanks!

I was wondering what are your must have's for your pantry/freezer/fridge to survive an ice/rain storm? I make sure I have some canned food, frozen meats (all kinds of steak, chicken and pork) and pizza, chips, fruit and veggies and bread and peanut butter and jelly.

I keep trying to sign up and I get an error message about your site "spamming".
Tried to get my Free Filet Package at Kroger this morning in Virginia Beach and they don't have your Product. Where in Virginia Beach can I find it?
After reading the review on GimmieFreebies of your steaks, my mouth is watering and it made me hungry for one!!!! 
hey. I was one of the winners a while back for the free filet. The giveaway where you had to refer 3 people and you win. I still have not rec mine. Just checking in. Thank you!
GimmieFreebies sent me! Ready to try some free meat!
Read the GimmieFreebies review and now I have a hankering for some steak!
i read the review on gimmie freebies page and i am hungry, i love steak
I just wanted to say "Thanks!!!" again for the free product coupon you mailed to me. I didn't get to use it for NYE like I wanted to, but that turned out to be a GOOD thing. I went to the grocery store today and they had them on sale Buy 1 Get 1 FREE. Regular price for a package of two bacon-wrapped filet is $7.99...so I walked out of there with two packages and it cost me only 99 cents plus tax. Great deal and I can't wait to try them!!!
Hi Chef Ken, Just read the rave reviews about your products on GimmieFreebies and would love to win and try your bacon wrapped chicken...sounds awesome. Happy New Year! And thank YOU and GimmeFreebies for the opportunity to win!
hello again. I was one of the winners a while back for the free filet. The giveaway where you had to refer 3 people and you win. I entered my information under the tab the day you announced the winners and still have not rec mine. Could you let me know if they've been mailed? Waiting for "steak night." Thanks.
I was a trivia winner on New Years Eve, just wondering if I actually won a prize and if so how do I claim it/receive it? Thanks :) 
ConsumerQueen.com will be picking her FREE Steak winners today! Keep an eye out for the winners list!
We have had some people that are following various diets ask us for the nutrition information for the Chef's Requested Foods Bacon Wrapped Steak if you removed the bacon. Here it is:
I was curious, back sometime in the beginning of November I believe I won a filet but have not received anything yet. How long does it take? Thank you. 
I have tried 4 times to sign up for Filet Mignon Friday, each time after clicking enter, I get an error message. :( Help, please?
it never ceases to amaze me how angry and greedy people get with these different giveaways for coupons and things, not just here, but on a lot of the business pages. Thanks for giving out coupons! I didn't get one, but that's okay - it was worth a shot!

We have single digit temps and a frozen cup of chowda! Keep guessing...we'll reveal the winner (if we get one) at 4pm.
We have a winner! The cup of NE Clam Chowder froze in exactly 18 minutes today in frosty Boston. Baby, it's cold outside! Congrats to Vicki Fleet Chatel and thanks to all who posted their best guesses. Stay warm.

Citrus Celebration: The Juicy Details! Phytochemicals found in citrus fruits have been shown to ward off various diseases and cancers. High citrus consumption has also been linked with a 50% lower risk of mouth, throat and stomach cancer. Try squeezing lemon or lime juice over your favorite dish to enhance the flavor and increase your citrus intake for less than 20 calories!
Citrus Celebration: The Juicy Details! Still not sold on citrus? Fresh citrus fruits contain zero grams of fat, sodium and cholesterol, which makes them a smart choice in many diets. Although fresh fruits are often highest in vitamins, minerals and fiber, eating canned fruits, such as mandarin oranges, is still a great way to enjoy the benefits of citrus!
What have you done to the Fareway Multi Grain Bread? I know the recipe was changed a while back but it seems like it's been changed again. The loaf we're eating now is W*I*M*P*Y! If I want wimpy bread, I'll buy it at a much lower cost. We have 3 loaves in the freezer. If they are the same as this one, then I guess I'll have to switch (after many years of loving Multi Grain!)
Here is a recipe to try with the amazing chicken breasts on SALE! 
I would have to agree - I would rather shop somewhere else in case a lunatic does come through the door with a gun/knife hopefully a law abiding gun carrying individual will help. I do not understand why businesses think a sign on the front door will stop some criminal from bringing in a weapon, come on. Some people have been carrying guns for years all that changed is that is a shall issue state. Sad cause I used to LOVE fareway, guess its HY-VEE for us.
I support the signs. Do you really feel the need to protect yourself with a gun while grocery shopping?? Every business has the right to set their own policies and I fully support Fareway. And I will remain a loyal customer to Fareway....with or without the signs.
Why is it such a big deal that a privately owned company not want concealed weapons in the store? Do the folks who want the signs down also want guns allowed in bars? This isn't the Wild West.
Thank you, Fareway, for seeing reason and taking down the "No Guns" signs in your stores. Criminals, obviously, will respect such a sign even less than they respect the laws they intend to break. Those who lawfully carry weapons for personal protection are not, and never have been, a threat to the customers or employees of Fareway, or any other place they choose to frequent. Just as we respect the law, we also would respect Fareway's right to refuse service to us because we choose to carry legally. As such, I had intended to keep myself, my sidearm and my money away from your establishment. Now I am very pleased to say that I will happily frequent my local Fareway store again. In fact, I think that I will go splurge on a few of your wonderful T-bone steaks for my family as a "thank you" for your quick and rational response to the concerns of law abiding Iowa Permit to Carry holders.
Thank you for removing the signs! As a long standing customer of Fareway, I was disappointed and hurt to discover that as a lawfully armed citizen I was no longer welcome to frequent your fine establishment, except that I change a fundamental part of myself. With the removal of the signs I am overjoyed, and feel a celebratory Fareway steak is in order!
Do any of the Fareway meat departments around Marshalltown carry fresh (not frozen) walleye fillets? Marshalltown only has frozen. Possibly Grinnell, Toledo, Neveda or Newton? I'm willing to drive if they have them.
$3 a head for cauliflower the size of a softball??? I love Fareway and have for about 20 years now. But your produce people need to get real. I had to go to the "big box" and saved nearly 30% for much better looking product. :(
i just got done talking to scott beckwith who is the VP of fareway, very cool story of how fareway was founded and started. i think there should be something under the facebook page of how it was started and all the history.

So, any directions for cooking my stuffed chicken breasts, featured in the ad? And I love the meat counter at Fareway! Just a side note, I'd have to call them more like, "bone-in breasts w/ some stuffing next to them" rather than stuffed... =)
Any word yet on the opening date in Dubuque??? I'm so excited for that day to come!!

Are you cooking with kids running at your feet? What is your secret to getting dinner done with kids?! Here a few of my secrets...share yours!
Getting excited to try the 8 lbs of Gold N Plump chicken that showed up on my doorstep today. Has anyone else used ground chicken before? I'm pretty happy about this, it beats shredding chicken!
Since I love my Apple Bread recipe, I'm adapting it today to make White Chocolate Cranberry bread...will let you know how it turns out! =)
My sister Money Saving Queen almost burnt down the station she works at heating up microwave fries today!! My mom almost burnt the house down cooking eggs for Christmas breakfast a few years ago. What's your story?! Have you done something like this? I'm sure if you are a fan of Mommy Hates Cooking you have! =)
Have you had cookies made with cake mix before? I posted my recipe this past week, but I am looking forward to trying many more cookie recipes with cake mix. What are some of your favorites using cake mix?
Going to try out my ground chicken with a broccoli casserole, in hopes my son will eat the broccoli...an so will I! =)
Record breaking snow is forecast here this week, I think I may be eating soup and chili all week!! Plus, praying that is misses us! =)
I thought I was going to bake cookies tonight, so I gave in and after 9 months of no frozen store bought food, I purchased a frozen pizza. I know, shameful right? Then, I realized I got my days mixed up! So, now this is going to be a mommy gets a break night! Even better!

When the snow starts falling and we are all stuck in side, I am going to have a nice big pot of Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup on the stove assuming the power is still on. What will you be cooking/baking?
Found a recipe for biscotti that I am about to try! It's going to go perfectly with my Milky Way Mocha's that I'm planning to make this Saturday! Yum! =)

I'm about to start baking White Chocolate Cranberry Bread...sounds perfect on this snowy, chilly afternoon!
I heard a pizza tip today that I thought you might want to try...it was on Mad Hungry Cooking show, and Lucinda Scala said she uses 1/2 c milk mixed with 1/2 cup water to give her dough a more "crackery" taste. If your amount of liquid is different from 1 cup, I would just take the amount your recipe calls for and substitute 1/2 of the water amount for the same amount of milk.
I successfully made my first homemade cake completely from scratch. Then, I successfully iced it. What did I learn? That I am definitely enrolling in a cake decorating class very soon! =)
Check out the site today for the Milky Way Mocha recipe, enjoy this warm treat in the midst of all this cold weather! =)

Chicken with Cashew Nuts - By Chef Chadi: Cut Chicken into peices, marinate over night with 2 teaspoons of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of Oyster Sauce and 1/4 cup of Soy Sauce.That's the marinade. Cut onions and add it to a pan with olive oil, add the chicken pieces only, add the raw Cashew Nuts ( Cajo) and stir. When the chicken is... cooked, add the marinade to the pan and wait for it to boil for a while until sauce becomes caramelized. Taste and add Salt if needed. min ba3ed iznak Chef :) we can add some oil,Ginger and garlic to the marinade - Yellow and green peppers,mushrooms or carrots to the onions when they are cooking if we want to put more vegetables in the recipe.

Ginepro In Italian Genievre in French Juniper in English in arabic Juniper berries are a spice used in a wide variety of culinary dishes and best known for the primary flavoring in gin (and responsible for gin's name, which is a shortening of the Dutch word for juniper, genever). Juniper berries are also used as the primary flavor in the liquor Jenever and sahti-style of beers. Juniper berry sauce is often a popular flavoring choice for quail, pheasant, veal, rabbit, venison and other meat dishes. American Indians have used juniper to treat diabetes; such treatments by the Navajo, for example, are under clinical study. Clinical studies have shown that treatment with juniper may retard the development of streptozotocin diabetes in mice.Native Americans also used juniper berries as a female contraceptive.The 17th Century herbalist physician Nicholas Culpeper recommended the ripened berries for conditions such as asthma and sciatica, as well as to speed childbirth.

pecan= "Pecan" is from an Algonquian word, meaning a nut requiring a stone to crack.[3] It is pronounced in various parts of the US as pi-KAHN, pi-KAN, PEE-kahn, or PEE-kan. In Mexico, pecans and walnuts share the same Spanish name, nuez, which is a cognate of the English word nut.

Just wanted to say I LOVE my crock pot...I use it AT LEAST 3-4 times a week. It makes it so easy for us to eat good on weeknights and avoid take out!! It's the best thing ever! My Mom always used her and when I got married (17 years ago!) I got one at my bridal shower and haven't looked back since!!
Love my crockpot. I use it on the weekends to make stew or soup!

I like your products, but your support people are useless. Placed an order online for a part, but decided to source it locally. That was Sunday. So emailed within an hour or so saying to cancel. Then called this morning before 9 AM (Eastern), and was told to "just refuse the shipment." Never got a response to the email (beyond the canned "we got it" one).

i have stuffed peppers cooking in my crockpot right now!
I have sausage and gravy in the crock pot now
We enjoy skinless boneless chicken breast. I put it in frozen and do not add any liquid, jst my poultry seasoning and a little celery salt. As it cooks it will make its own broth. You do have to strain and then use the broth for gravy or to do dumplings if you like. We enjoy this hot and cold - the next day...
Chicken stuffing bake is cooking away on the counter...

I have my pork chops with the dr.pepper, worcheshire sauce, and ketchup.. yummy love it!
Fill in the blank. If I could only cook one dish in my slow cooker every day for an entire year, I would choose _pork roast_. Just love how the slow cooker cooks pork and most other meat. Makes the house smell great too!!!!!!!
 If I could only cook one dish in my slow cooker every day for an entire year, I would choose __Italian Pasta Sauce with Meatballs and Italian Sausage________.
If I could only cook one dish in my slow cooker everyday for an entire year, I would choose barbecued pulled pork
pork roast also!
I need a new crock pot. I have a GE 3qt. oval that has been good to me. I am looking for a 5qt. oval (I like the shape). I am not sure what brand would be the best. Can you give me some pointers? 
I need a recipe for anything with ground beef and my crock pot. Anyone have a good one?
do I have to brown the roast before I cook it? Can I just put it in the Crockpot without browning first?
Just an odd little tidbit here: We're moving just a short distance away to a new home. The Crock Pot carrying bags are SUPER for stacking dishes, etc. in, loading into the car and transporting to their new home! I have two and they are saving me a lot of wrapping and packing! LOL, just thought I'd share. See? Your products are great even if nothing is being cooked at the moment!

Serve over rice with more crushed red pepper flakes on top. 
Today is The Festival of Seven Herbs in Japan. This long-standing custom includes eating seven-herb rice porridge. Anyone have a slow-cooker recipe for rice porridge they can share?
TIP: Cooking a meal with shellfish? For ideal results, cook on high and add the shellfish during the last 15-30 minutes of cook time.
That was tonight's dinner: Pot Roast with carrots, potatoes and a wonderful gravy. The little crock pot is one of those originally for poppori with NO controls, just plug it in and forget it for several hours.

Do you know where the word Cajun came from? What is now Nova Scotia was once called Acadia when settled by the French, who were known as Acadians. Deported by order of the British in 1755, they settled (largely) in southern Louisiana, in several towns about 120 miles west of New Orleans. The name Acadian eventually corrupted into cajun. Cajun is a term largerly associated with Louisiana now.

Just had my first Pork and green chille burrito yesterday. I think it's my new favorite. LOVE it! <3
While perusing the frozen section at Whole Foods I came upon the evol brand. I am a vegetarian and was delighted to see the bowls and the ones with no meat! Just had the beans and cheese with enchilada sauce! Soo yum! And so impressed that its gluten free and conscious of the products that go in it (because its not organic). A++ for evol!

eating my 1st bowl - Chicken Enchilada - YUM! thanks for having a super tasty gluten-free option!
Evol Crew: feel free to correct me on this, but I see a lot of posts on here saying "bring products to Anywhere, USA please." Evol doesn't "push" product, grocers "pull" product. If a store near you doesn't have the Evol product you want, ask the grocer to bring the product in, not Evol to ship the product out. Correct, yes?
I'm just having my first Evol Beef Burrito. It's really amazing just like everyone was saying. I got it at Kroger so I'm glad to see I can get them close when I want them.
I had a Sausage and Egg burrito for breakfast and my first Teriyaki bowl for lunch. Both were perfect. Exactly what I needed. Just wait till I send you guys the picture of all the wrappers and boxes I've been saving. Thanks Evol!

Hi from W865 iruma japan
Costco is a good place however the Costco team doesn't send monthly coupons . Its been 5 months i have registered and i have got coupons only once. I don't like this. i have membership with BJ's they are little expensive than Costco but service is good.
The Kirkland brand moisture shampoo is great! A fraction of the cost of most designer shampoo's and I dare say it works better than most? I'm a Costco convert. Happy New Year!
 I bought some fresh salmon yesterday from Costco, just thought I'd try it. Those of you who have tried meats and/or fish from Costco, what do you think compared to what you buy at the grocery store? 
Where can i buy some kirkland branded alcohol?
COME TO PORTLAND MAINE!!!!!
What happened to Ravon Asley? Did Drew get himself blocked again? That silly rabbit...
They got the best Grilled Salmon! Mmmmmmmm
Has anyone tried the Kirkland Signature Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner? Was thinking of buying some to try, curious to see if anyone has tried it.I did order the free sample!
Just wanted to share a bad experience with Costco. Two weeks ago, at 6:30 am. on my way to work there was a Costco shopping cart on the inside left lane of Auburn Blvd, in CItrus Heights, CA, just past the Costco driveway. As there was another car next to me in the right hand lane and a cement center divider on my left side, I had no choice but to hit the cart. This resulted in almost $2,300.00 in damages to my left front headlight, fender, bumper and hood. I completed an incident report with the Costco store which was then sent with pictures of the damage to their coporate headquarters. Yesterday I received a letter from Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc. informing me that after reiewing the facts they do not believe that Costco is responsible and must "respectfully" deny the clam. 
Continued... The Citrus Heights Costco does not put their carts inside their facility after hours. The are lined up in front of the store and are not contained, chained or otherwise rendered unmovable. This practice allows anyone access to the carts and then anyone can do what they like with the carts. I am so angry that this neighborhood Costco is not willing to take responsibility for the damage to my car and is in fact not a community oriented business. I have filed a complaint with our city police department and also with my employer, Hewlett Packard, which supports Costco by offering the Costco membership as a benefit to its employees. Our Costco membership renewal is this month and we will not be renewing it. We will however be swiching to Sams Club. My entire extended family and all of our friends and aquintances will also be leaving Costco. 
What happened to the Kirkland diapers???? I used them when my twins were small and swore by them. I had some coupons from pampers that I got through their multiples program so I was using those for a while. When I switched back (also had to go up a size) I have had a leak every single diaper, got halfway through the box and switched back to pampers because I just don't have the time for extra diaper changes and laundry! Now I have half a box of diapers just sitting in my garage :(
How do we get Costco to add coffee to the snack bar? I have written the suggestion many times and still no coffee. They sell the best colombian coffee in the world they should serve it too. I don't drink soft drinks so there is no choice when getting the hotdog combo. 
Why isn't there a Costco in Pikesville or Owings Mills MD yet?!
Costco can you make it possible to get the coupons on a smartphone. I would love do that in lieu of getting them in the mail. Target does coupons this way. It would be more convenient than lugging the coupon book around. Just a thought! :) 
Thank you, Thank you, thank you, Costco for FINALLY having a healthy option in your food concession! I love your poutine, but know it's about as unhealthy a food choice as possible. Your Apple Pecan Chicken Salad is FABULOUS!!!!! I LOVE it and like having a choice other than deep fried foods! :)
Thank you Costco for your continued support of your employees. Husband is working on 14 years. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Costco no longer sells the Kirkland Halibut filets here in Colorado Springs (atleast not on the Westside)- is there any way to request items?? Thanks.
Should be another busy day today at work (Costco)...will definalely wear my running shoes...time flys by so fast when we're busy :-)
 Builder on long island looking to build more houses than currently doing. Contrary to the media'a gloomy reports on housing, there is still a multitude of opportunities on select locations of long island. I presently use my own capital to build about 2 houses per year. I am not trying to sound "full of myself" but my reputation in the industry from buyers to suppliers is impeccable -and I can back this up with names and numbers. I am on every job and consider each house built to be the one I would live in until we hand over the key. I need someone with large pockets to buy the existing property and supply the capital for me to build it. I would propose a 50/50 split on net profits and this works out to be about a 10% return to the I investor. I am as honest and sincere as they come and would love to find someone who just wants to have a great relationship and make lots of money. Please email me @ premiernshomes@aol.com
Sorry Costco, but you have me irritated. Your renewal policies are archaic and ridiculous. Make me pay full price for renewal because I forgot my year-end cash back certificate. Both the cashier and customer "lack of" service said they could see the cash back, but could not give me credit without the paper certificate. Really?
Bring back the Jack's Salsa! I bought Especial Salsa yesterday and it is terrible. It has a horrible aftertaste. 
Any advice for me on "upgrading" a Dell laptop I want through the Costco site BEFORE buying? I want the Inspiron 17R for $700, and a sales associate said I could "build" the hardware of the computer the Dell way through the Costco site, but I can't see where I can. Thanks in advance! :)
Please please please install a Coinstar or equivalent machine to convert my change into a Costco Cash card!
Love going to costco. Just wondering if the weather will effect the company hours for some area like Myrtle Beach due to risk of wrecks etc. since schools and local goverment will be closed today?
For the first time in four years in Mexico, the Xalapa Costco refused to take my Discover Card and Mastercard. Can't figure it out. I've used the Discover card whenever I have a large purchase to make - usually I pay cash because it's cheaper to do so. Can someone give me the name of the person who is head of Costco Mexico?
i want to be on sale!
I like costco wholesale!
The management team at the Salt Lake City location are unfair and don't own up to their own mistakes. The stupid manager said he couldn't honor the price match, even though if was their fault, but offered to buy me a piece of freakin pizza. WTF??????
I just got back from Costco. Costco is FTW!!!
i love costcos pizzas
i love costcos pizzas
Wishing they'd open a costco in Brisbane, Australia...
Did the happy dance and squealed out loud when I discovered there is a Costco in Kona, Hawaii! 1st stop when we get off the plane!
i'm still trying to figure out if i like you or not
In & Out Plumbing would like to thank you Costco for your business. Its a pleasure working with you!
SHAME ON COSTCO for getting rid of the frozen Organic Blueberries in San Antonio, Sonterra Blvd. Store. Everyone knows when blueberries are non organically grown it causes you more harm than good because they absorb all the toxins. Therefore, Non organic Frozen bueberries are more toxic for you and you are better off not eating them. BRING BACK THE ORGANIC FROZEN BLUEBERRIES TO COSTCO WAREHOUSE IN SAN ANTONIO, TX, SONTERREA STORE
THANK YOU COSTCO for bringing backto San Antonio, TX Sonterrea Store, the frozen organic raspberries AND SAMBOZON ACAI Juice. Sambozon is one of the few true juices that is pure ACAI and endorsed as being such by many authorities on ACAI purity. Those were 2 great products you made a mistake with.
The Like button does not appear on your page to me is there something wrong with it?
Food for thought: (literally!) I live in Atlanta where we are still digging out from snow and ice. Who came to the rescue of people stranded with no food at the Greyhound Station and to the soldiers and their families stuck at the airport when the USO ran out of supplies? COSTCO! THAT'S why I love them! Thank you, Costco! 
Just wanted to say that im going to miss my costco family in strongsville, oh when i move in a few weeks :( love you guys
THANK YOU for bringing Mexican Cokes back to central Florida!!
Thank you so much for carrying the Vanilla unsweetned Almond Milk! We are saving $10 a week from this! Costco as always you are the best!
anybody go to Costco just for the samples?
i friggin luv you guys! berrie smoothies! yumm yummy!
PLEASE let us buy gelato one scoop at a time! Three scoops is just way too much for any normal sized person. (And no, I don't want my bum to be big enough for 3 people either!)
 Worst ever customer service at Costco today. Chicken breasts looked brown not pink, organic Fuji apples were rotting. Surly, slow, dismissive behavior. What is going on with my Costco? 
Did Costco discontinue frozen blackberries? They were out of them today in Roseville, CA. Just curious if anyone has heard anything.
Hey does anyone work at the new costco in MANHATTAN, BY 116 STREET and the FDR DR. ? if so, inbox me or add me, Please. My brother recently applyed online and need to find the general manager's number and name or the person who is in charge of hiring, so he can make his moves. any one with this info please help us out. Thank you all!!
i love costco. that being said, do you think your locations could open up a bit earlier than 10am? say maybe, 8am? that would be great, as i work overnight! just a thought. :-)
Dear Costco, You sell wine, beer and liquor, but can you start selling the mojito mix and bloody mary mix to go with some of those spirits?
Thanks to Brookhaven CostCo for plowing their parking lots days ago! My doggies just enjoyed a nice dry stroll, and none of us had to slip and slide in ice and snow.
Best deal on milk in town
Does Costco have a restocking fee on returned laptops?
so suprise to see frozen blackberry at costco. the one that i go to only had frozen blueberry. i make smoothies everyday with frozen blueberry with almond milk. so delicious. 
The cilantro-lime shrimp pizza was AMAZING. Try it out!! 
My giant bottle of honey crystallized and the cap is too small for a spoon. Pls make the opening larger so I don't waste half the honey again.
Just tried the Kirkland brand beer this weekend, it is quite tasty and a really good deal!
My boyfriend and I just joined Costco today and tried the shrimp and crab ravioli and dinner was a delicious hit!
COSTCO is the happiest place on earth!
Please introduce the Hawaiian Pizza at you food Courts like in Mexico's warehouses; every time I go there, I need to eat one slice of Hawaiian Pizza. Yummy!
Did you stop carrying Earthbound Organic (washed) Spinach? the other brand isn't washed and it's a pain. The organic, washed is better.
great pizza 
HELP! I'm trying to find a product I know you guys used to carry... I'm just not sure if you still do! it's an ourdoor furniture set called: Curve 2-pc Lounger W/ Umbrella Includes: Loveseat, Storage Ottoman and Umbrella. I want to buy this ASAP. I just spent the last 2 hours tracking this down to you guys. Please, please, please help. Thanks Costco Facebook team! 
Just tried the frozen Edamames in their individual serving size steamer bags! Great idea! Love them, love them!!!!
Would love to see more organic products at the Canadian Warehouses - staple products like flour, cooking oil, rice, produce, snacks. You have some great one like Mary's crackers but would love to see some more.
Love Costco!!! please open a new location in Sugar Land, TX 
Your Kirkland brand diapers are AWESOME! So please make some pull ups!!!
PLEASE bring back your 2pk of organic orange juice! What happened to it?
Hadn't had a V8 Juice in about 10 years, but now thanks to Costco, I have 36 cans! (I counted them.) Everyone's so nice at the Mountain View store...Carrie Freelance Writing, Editing, Branding, Publications Management is appreciative.
had more and more bad experiences with Costco. I was going with my dad to buy stuffs at Costco tonite and after checkout while I was getting CASH from my wallet and about to pay them, that super mean cashier looked at me and said "Only he can pay for it." I was like ?!?! Only becuz he is the cardholder? And I'm paying them cash, not with a debit card! Plus he stood right next to me! So I had to hand my dad the money and he actually had to give that freaking woman the money from his hands!!! What's more? Tonite Costco's food court misplaced the pizza order that I called in from noon and denied that it's their fault. I looked at them and asked "A lady picked up the phone and isn't ur phone end with 1607?" They looked surprised. Later on I DIDN'T even get a single sorry from them. If I have to rank any place for their discrimination against a certain race, then congratulations to Costco in Arlington, TX, you're the TOP of the tops.
My friends and family call me the Costco queen. I just love my Beltsville, MD store!
Ok, Costco, I love ya but........I live in the apple capital of the world.....you'd think you would get a better selection of apples that aren't soft! Please! This is a major staple in my diet! 
goin to costco tonight to get me some chicken n salad!! and tp 
our Costco didn't carry Naked Chicken Nuggets this week...BUMMED =(
http://www.facebook.com/pages/I-hate-COSTCOs-Milk-containers/157268357657001
REALLY miss the rotisserie chicken salad!!!! PLEASE bring it back!
Pizza Roadshow is amazing!!!!
do any costco's have coffee shops? they should!!! :)
I used to find Executive membership better, but my area Costcos keep deleting the products I use, without warning. I ask at my local store and they can't give me reasons for the delete. I call customer service and just get a computer. You can't talk to a real person to get answers . I am starting to find that membership is more expensive than it is worth. 
Costco (Area Code 20109) should be more polite for non-customers in redirecting to the membership desk. Also the membership desk I have to wait for more than 5 minutes and no one to address my queries.
Just joined Costco and would love to hear what everyone's favorite items are -- there are so many things to try! Rotisserie chicken was awesome. I heard the Kirkland bath towels were great, but my store didn't have them. What else is a "must buy" that's unique to Costco?
VERY SAD Costco has begun to keep old prices and cutting (grossly) the portions. Just bought some pistachios (the only price that I noticed). Same price as before. Was 4 lbs, now 3lbs. Getting to be that Costco is not cheaper than anyone any longer. 
I Will Go Eat A Chicken Bake At Costco Today..I Promise Haha
Can any gals tell me the brands of cosmetics and shampoos they have there? I went today for groceries but caught a glimpse of hair salon brand shampoos and Stila Cosmetics. Any other great brands I missed?
just bought my baby the kirkland formula. hope it goes well for him!
I wish Costco had the Wetjet Pad refills instead of the wetclothes. 
Is it true that not only do you sell Halal certified meats, but that you dont label it Halal if you have to repack it? What about those religious groups who believe that they shouldnt eat food that was offered up to other gods or idols? Dont you have a responsibility to let them know?
It's shame, yesterday I walked out of the Naperville location with my girls and when they check the receipt the woman drew three happy faces on the receipt for my girls with a Hindu dot on all three happy faces. Costco employees are being discriminative and racist. I do not want to shop there and when I showed the receipt to the manager there he made a copy and says he does not know what that is I will post the copy of the receipt soon.
I am a customer in Columbus, Ohio. Can someone please explain why your bakery does not have a phone? I have needed to change a pick-up date for a cake order, and it was a bit of a hassle trying to get through. It seems only logical that there would be a number prompt to get directly to the bakery without having to go through other departments. Is this the case for all of your stores? With such a large corporation, it is hard to understand why there is no phone in any department, especially one for which people place regular orders. 
Hi Costco! If you have a twenty dollar bill, hold on to it and wait for the big announcement coming from the Dave Greber Freelance Writers Awards in early February ... more information coming soon! http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=486357&l=b5105ee304&id=100000693034709
Costco is wonderful, but I so do wish that the milk jugs weren't designed in such a silly way. They so easily spill. :)
Went to Costco & purchased a pizza (not just a slice), shared it with 2 friends for lunch. Asked for a cup for water and they handed me this thimble cup. Costco should be embarrassed to be doing this. Even a small Styrofoam cup would have been better than this. I am hoping Costco changes their practice on this... http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=491610401217

I live in Australia and when in the US in Sept 09 I visited Costco in Utah with my sister who resides there and I couldn't believe my eyes the amount of products, the service and cost was just great I can't wait until Costco comes to Queensland Australia one day can't be soon enough. Having everything under one roof great although most things are bulk buy it was a very good experiecne. Love Costco.
I am a loyal Costco customer - Sam's whaaa?? However, it's a pain that I have to drive all the way to Charleston, SC from Columbia to shop there!! Costco, please share your greatness with the city of Columbia!! 
Please Bring back Horseradish Cheddar and Wasabi Horseradish Cheddar from Yanceys Fancy. http://www.yanceysfancy.com/order_cheese.htm
The mango peach salsa is the best!
normally happy with Costco's merchandize but we just got to use our snowblower for the first time and it went 6 feet and then broke down. now have to get it to the warehouse for return. we do not own a truck or large van tog et it there(had it delivered). not happy with their snowblower from this year. 
I have to go back to Costco for a few things...but its such an issue to walk back home with the cart....Now if Costco had delivery..................
just went to Jewel-Costco love the wings buy em
We can't get the sea salt rice work rice chips in Toledo Ohio Does any other costco stores carry them. 
We can't get the sea salt rice work rice chips in Toledo Ohio Does any other costco stores carry them. 
Please bring back frozen blackberries for the Roseville, CA Costco store. You have been out of stock for two weeks!
I don't understand why Costco hasn't been voted in the top 10 places to work. any body got any info on this? I'm just saying, after 24 years, I know I made the right decision to stay.
I would LOVE a Costco in the Philadelphia area - the closest one is Mt. Laurel, NJ. Just a suggestion.
I went in the Costco in Hoover, AL, and was very disappointed that the meat department would not cut a whole ribeye when I purchased it. I have had other Costco stores cut my steaks before, a free service that Sam's Club provides. Why should I not switch to Sam's if my Costco is not going to provide this service?
I am super impressed about the Costco Cash Card I received in the mail over the not so perfect peaches. Which I didn't even ask for. No other retailer would live up to their products this way!!!! Costco, you are awesome. 
Hey - how about an iPhone app that lets you find stuff at Costco? Every time I go to a different Costco, everything is in a different place. I'm always scratching my head thinking, "Where the hell are the Sunsweet prunes?" Sometimes, they're stocked next to the cereal and syrup. Last time, they were next to the detergent.
I like Costco, but the Bloomfield Hills, Michigan store just stacked their fertilizer in the fresh produce section. Nasty!!! Wife called to complain and the Manager seemed indifferent. It is a rare disappointment.
I love Costco, but do not receive any of the coupons in the mail. I emailed Costco and they never responded. I know that I can pick them up at the service desk, but often that line is out the door. I hate to have to wait in line for 20 minutes for a coupon book. 
"Costco!!! Two years ago I bought a GPS from Costco for $550 (on sale). Well after almost two years it stopped working right. I took it back to Costco...without a receipt. Costco gave me a full credit!!!! COSTCO IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!! Costco you have really earned (and deserve) my respect and loyalty! Thank You Costco! P.S. I'd like to mention that everybody that I personally have ever dealt with at Costco has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help me and my family out. Well done Costco!!!" ~ Willis Nelson, Las Vegas, NV
Thank you Costco for the wonderful Birthday NY steaks and lobster. Our family had a great meal!
Any thoughts on the Kirkland brand detergents? Do any fade colors?
Celebrity Cruises and Costco Travel have teamed up to offer a series of winery-hosted cruises through the Mediterranean. Each sailing includes unique member-exclusive wine events onboard. These 6- to 12-night sailings have added values of up to $420 per person and start at $1,699 per person for a balcony stateroom. See more at http://ctrv.us/WineCruises.
I live for Costco. I first became a member when it was Price Club in Westbury in 1997.
What is the price for your soul??? This is the question that should be asked of Raven Rex Franco. Last year Erik Scott was murdered at a Costco location in NV. Many supporters of Erik immediately came to the Costco Facebook page to voice their opinions and disgrace of Costcos role in his death. Costco immediately resp...onded by allegedly hiring Raven Rex Franco the page administrator. Ms. Franco has taken on multiple profiles (Sandra Elsewood, Ashley Jones, Bob Johnson, David Palmer, Lincoln Aiello) purely to censor, belittle, and antagonize these supporters. A job so disgraceful it makes one wonder. What WAS the price for Ravon Rex Francos soul? www.erikbscott.com

Just ordered more long-burning beeswax candles from Sunbeam Candles (where their operation is solar-powered - way cool). Got red hearts and their "Gift of Love" red pillars, plus their cinnamon & cloves votives (imagine: beeswax + cinnamon + cloves = wow). They'll all look - and smell! - gorgeous in baskets.
New delivery of beeswax candles.

Wedding Wednesday Wisdom: Don't rush it. A lot of couples get overwhelmed by registering, feeling they have to get it all done at once, and that every decision is final. This is totally normal. But relax, take your time and have fun. Come back to see your registry consultant as many times as you need. And of course, you can always update your registry online.
Wedding Wednesday Wisdom: Because, sometimes, we could all use a little help. From the time you start your registry until well after you walk down the aisle, our dedicated registry consultants are available for you, ready to make the whole experience fun and stress-free. Just walk into the store nearest you or call to make an appointment at a time that's most convenient for you. http://ow.ly/3B8BY

Love BB&B! Great for Keurig coffee; especially with coupons!
SUGGESTION YOU SHOULD PUT COUPONS ON HERE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT USE YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE JUST INCENTIVES.
i think bed bath and beyond should send out more coupons and have a special one for people who 'like' their facebook page. plus, use facebook as a way of getting people into the stores by sending them coupons. for inspiration look at Gap's facebook page. They have amazing in store 1-day only sales for up to 40% on their ENTIRE purchase, not just one item. I love bed bath and beyond but some stuff in there isn't cheap! lol

Does anyone else have a difficult time watching the show "From the Kitchens of..." with Brigitte Ngyen? Brigitte is adorably cute and the recipes are interesting, but I don't know why they even put guests on the show with Brigitte. She doesn't hardly let them get a word in. She talks 90 miles a minute to the point that all of her words are just running together and it starts sounding like an annoying buzz. Slow down and relax Brigitte!!! 
debi mazar n gabriele corcos r really trying
If Rachel is showing us how to cook a weeks worth of meals in 1 day, why does she not say how long this stay good in the refrigerator? Dont you have to either freeze cooked chicken, or reheat it within 3 days? It would be nice if she could add this information into her show.

I am SO VERY HAPPY to see some of the "non" NFNS winners on the cooking channel...seeing Kelsey Dixon was very nice! the talent should NOT be wasted because they didn't take first place!

Does anyone no how to get the recipe for the coconut blackberry slice that was on today's episode of Bills Food?
Does anyone know the name of this? I think it was with Roger Mooking, maybe on heat seekers. Anyway, I think it was Indian, and it was a flatbread, almost a tortlla on a grill, and you tear a piece off an use it like mitts to scoop out sauces and the like. One of them was coconut based. 
Does anyone have a recipe similar to Catch 35's Chilean Sea Bass with Hawaiian ginger scallion sauce or Hugo's Frog Bar Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Marinade, mushroom and peas? Please send it to me if you so!!! I would be forever grateful!! :)

the guy making the krugel (or whatever) must be deaf in one ear because he is yelling in a very unnecessary way. wicked annoying. changing the channel now. 
what's up with this show "bitchin Kitchen"? couldn't it have a different name? I can't have this channel on when the G-kids are here cause I hope to teach my g-kids NOT to talk like that and I can't have them seeing it and thinking that is OK cause they saw it on a cooking channel. Maybe a really good show but I will never know! just had to vent a little!
I am trying to watch "Week in a Day" with Rachel Ray, and am bored silly! Even she appears to be bored with what she's doing. She'd probably rather be doing her talk show now.

im not mentioning any names, but im fed up watching chefs wiping sweat off their head area, touching and wiping their noses, playing with their hair while cooking food while the world is watching them on tv. im very concerned what goes on in the kitchens in these so called up scale restaurants, when the camera isnt rolling. does anyone else notice this, or is it just me....

YAYYYY!!! My favourite chef of all time. I'm starting Art Institute of Vancouver Culinary Program this Monday!!!! Gonna be just like you one day :)
Welcome to Facebook Bobby! I'm a big fan--have your cookbook 'From My Kitchen To Your Table', there's a blast from the past! And I've been watching since the 'Main Ingredient' days...keep bringin the HEAT!
Hey Bobby! Throw Down is the best! You are extremely talented. Looking forward to eating at one of NYC restaurants. Would love to shake your hand.
Love throwdown! Your dishes truly are a work of art. I have just one criticism... Ricotta belongs in Lasagna, NOT CANNOLIS!!! It was painful watching that episode.
Hey Bobby. Met ya in Jersey, Eatontown BBP, just wanted to say keep it going, love Throwdown, Grill It, and BBP. Rock on sir! 
You are the reason I take such pride in being my family's cook/chef. Also, I'm not sure how I would have continued to live without chipotle pure. 
Hey Bobby, when are you opening something in the Washington DC Metro area/ We need you...
Glad you are finally on Facebook! See you in Sobe and at Fasig-Tipton next month!~Pasta Sunday. 
Your BBP restaurant at smithhaven mall in NY is the absolute best burger place ever! I could eat dinner there every night! So glad I live close by!! 
Hey, i'm currently attending a culinary college in Michigan called the Culinary Institute of Michigan. I envy your cooking style and your creativity, i was wondering if u could give me a chance to speak with you and talk to you about an internship at one of your restaurants..... it is a requirement to graduate and i thought i could think outside of the box and message one of my chefs that i highly admire. You truly inspire to cook and create, hopefully you can respond to this and help me. I know you probably get this quite a bit but i thought it would be worth a shot... Thank You
I heart you, Bobby Flay..Love watching you on throw-down...Would love to see a throw-down between you and Giada???
so excited you finally have a page. You are my favorite (male) chef. I actually met you Valentine's Day 2008 at Mesa Grill in Vegas!!!! Best Valentine's Day ever......sssshhhhh don't tell my fiance. 
Can we get the Chicago Burger again?
Hi Bobby, it is just so cool you have a facebook page! Watch you whenever I can! Read about you in the Guidepost, awesome how you started! So proud : ) love ya
I had the pleasure of dining at Bar Americain on Wednesday. Delicious! I love the pizza appetizer, and the pork might have been the best pork I've ever eaten! Thanks for a terrific night! Can't wait to go back! You rock!
Cooking a Bobby Flay Southern Italian meal this weekend...three meat meatballs (pork, veal, and beef) with pasta, chicken parmigiana, and tri colore salad!
Hi Bobby! I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate all of your cooking shows (from "Boy Meets Grill" to "Throwdown"); I've learned many great cooking techniques from watching you. I just bought a pack of dried ancho chiles yesterday, and I can't wait to use them! Keep cooking!
HI BOBBY! JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I HV LEARNED TO COOK BY WATCHING YOUR SHOWS AND PAULA DEANS SHOWS. YOU TWO ARE MY FAVORITE SHOW S TO WATCH . I HOPE THAT SOMEDAY I WILL OWN MY OWN RESTRAUNT, IT WOULD BW COOL TO MEET YOU AND PAULA DEAN
Hi Bobby...I am a married, stay at home father of two and I want to thank you for Throwdown. I DVR all of them and when I need a break and watch one. For some reason your show makes me truely smile. If you ever do a show in Chicago I would love a heads up so I can be in the crowd. Better yet, why don't you open a joint here.
Hi Bobby! I just wanted to thank you for Boy Meets Grill and Grill It!.I'm a novice home cook as the economy has blessed me with changing my eating habits. I'm having a Blast!! I learn something new and fun every time I watch. Thank You for all the great recipes and techniques.
Hi Bobby- I live in Hartford Ct & have had the opportunity to eat @Mesa Grill several times & Bar Americain twice-have difficulty going anywhere else because I like your restaurants so much. Service is absolutley fabulous-staff is friendly & helpful. Thanks for bringing so much to my culinary world. Hope to get to Mohegan Sun soon to try your restaurants there! PS Stoli is my fav vodka so it was a real plus to find Stoli Bloody Mary's on your brunch menu!!
Hi,Bobby,I was wondering will you ever bring Bobby's Burger Palace to Houston,Texas?I am also glad to see you on FACE BOOK now:)

Chef, I'm entering a Chili Cook Off (first time for me). My husband tells me that my chili is good, but not what people might be expecting. I make is kind of mild (my taste), any suggestions for spiceing it up a bit? I was thinking maybe some jalapeno peppers....
Hey Bobby is it true that u r coming to Princeton Market Fair in late Spring early summer to open a Bobby's Burger? Well all of us at Williams Sonoma are very excited and can't wait to have lunch there. :) 
Hey Bobby - I challenge you to a Beer Braised Corned Beef throwdown ;)) Dinner will be ready at 6.
My Favorite chef!!! I will love a throwdown with my tortilla soup or my STUFFED CHICKEN WITH BROCCOLI AND CILANTRO SAUCE
A big thank you for helping me gain a fresh appreciation my my Tex-Mex roots again. i live here in San Antonio Texas and have been eating Tex Mex all my life, but for the past five years or so i just refused to go near it as i was sick and tired of it. i would of course eat it at my grandmothers house out of respect, but my cooking has drifted to Greek, Italian, and French. But YOU led me back home with your SOUTH OF THE BORDER SHOW...OMG!! the home fries and your take on Huevos Rancheros is just INCREDIBLE!!...TAHNKS BOBBY!!
I know every great chef loves to use butter and salt and every great ingredient at your disposal, but how do you do that and stay fit? Is keeping portions small the way to enjoy great food and not gain a ton?
Bobby I'm up after midnight trying to make the custard to your Coconut cake. It was my first time using a wisk and I guess it's called tempering? Anyway, I heard you tell some culinary students to "just cook and the rest will come". I use to shy away from baking, but regardless of how it goes, I finally realized that if you don't try you'll never learn or get better. Thanks for sharing your knowledge.....I have a family of female cooks that try to hold on to dishes, tips and don't share their secrets. 
Hi Bobby. I'm intersted in getting a grill but I have 3 in mind and I don't know what to get with little money like $100-$120. Should I get a coal grill, a portable gas, or a regular gas grill?
Hey Bobby,,i have been a fan for a long time now but i am starting to notice how many times you get beat in everything from Thowdown to Iron CHef America,,what gives? you really need to step up your game,,tonight's Iron Chef was a disaster,,you got to get on the ball again,,
I just started watching your ICA episode from last night on my DVR. OMG you had a smack-down with a food processor! I'm sorry but I couldn't stop laughing at it! I'm currently trying to write down & deconstruct on of your lobster recipes from last night. 
hey Bobby, are you available for personal appearances? We are doing a chili cookoff at our church anniversary celebration in beautiful Fredericksburg TX and that would be cool if you could come and be a judge or enter your chili and do a throwdown with all the contestants.
Hi I'm new to this but a was loking a way to write to you bobby or someone from your staf about some recipies how can i send them to you. Sorry for my writing I'm not very good in english thank you if someone write me back.
It's almost a Mardi Gras time here in Louisiana. We would all like to see a King Cake throw down competition!
Hello Bobby I can't wait to Taste your cooking. I've Tried several Recipes. I want to experience it for myself. Grilling is my Favourite Rain or Shine if I have charcoals or wood. Take Care #TeamTip
As i have postedand asked in the past, since your wife is from Texas, it would be nice to have any of your restaurants here in Dallas, best place to set up a Mesa grill, you know everyone around here loves their steak. Love Ya!
Hey Bobby My Daughter and I Dinned at Bar Americian! Truely THE BEST FOOD I EVER ATE! When Ever I'm in NYC I always Stop in and have a Drink at the Bar! Your STAFF is AWESOME! ((They make me feel like a WELCOMED REGULAR!)) I Hope to See You soon!
Hey Bobby, have you ever visited Jamaica? If yes, what local cuisine is your favourite?
Chef, I am a HUGE fan! I was in NYC last december and had a chance to enjoy a delicious lunch at Mesa Grill. I do hope you enjoyed the Costa Rican coffee and Rainforest vanilla I left for you! :o)
Hi Bobby, it's your long lost half-brother, Jeff :) I was at Mesa Grill @ the Atlantis and your staff (& many patrons) though I was you! I did get a great table! Awesome food, we'll need to "throw down" with my jalapeno, triple meat, jack cheese scramble!
See ya @ the sunwinefest
Bobby-just read in FN Magazine that you're seeking innovative grillers for your next season of "Grill It!" I applied last season and ALMOST made it. WHat are you looking for in your grillers for next season? - The All Seasoned Griller in Tulsa!
Bobby, it needs to be said...you have been upset twice in a row IN YOUR HOUSE. You are the best iron chef there is and the best sous chefs should have your back. Christine sanchez HAS GOT TO GO!!! Five dishes in 60 minutes is stressful enough without hearing her mouth the whole time! 
hey whats up bobby im a dealer at ceasers ac rollett ur burger places ar they going to b franchises if so the pair at ceasers is despretly needing somehing like that
Hello Bobby! I met you yesterday at your restaurant Bar Americain and asked you if it was possible to get the recipe for the quail egg/filet appetizer that was prepared for the group I came with. You told me to write you on Facebook and you would send it to me so I would be super appreciative if you were still okay with doing that. Thank you so much and I had a great time visiting and hearing you speak!!
I think you need to create a "Bobby Flay Mignon Burger". 
Hey, Bobby! Just wanted to tell you how fun & cool it is to be getting the BBP posts on FB. Ur crew is doing a great job posting awesome info & fun stuff...though I caught them in a Turkey faux pas at Thanksgiving, but we'll let it slide ;) ....lol. It was a riot! Can't wait to visit a BBP!!! hope your holidays were great!
Why does EVERYTHING have to be so spicy and hot? I just can't enjoy the food if my mouth is on fire and in pain! (BTW, I can't even handle black pepper because it burns my mouth.)
I love, love, love my autographed Throwdown book that my kids got me for Christmas. It's just awesome! Best gift ever!
Bobby, Chicago is screaming for a Mesa Grill.......PLEASE !! im begging..lol.....
HELLO BOBBY CAN YOU LET ME KNOW WHEN YOUR NEXT BOOK SIGNING IS:) MY 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER MISSED THE 1 AT STEW LEONARDS IN CT BECAUSE I WAS SICK:( CHEF CENTRAL IN HARTSDALE WOULD BE A DREAM COME TRUE ROSILYN :)
Hey bob. Just finished watchin your show. I believe you need stronger sous chefs. Stop in for dinner if you ever come thru oakland md. Me and the fam would love to meet ya. 
Bobby what is going on with the cooking Channel? Is under the same unbrella as Food Channel? I really appreciate your shows and your recipes. Thanks forall you do to bring us new and challenging ideas we can try at home. 
Hi Bobby! I'm a huge fan of yours, and I'll be attending the International Arts Institute of downtown Minneapolis. I really do admire everything little detail and texture in your way of cooking and such. It would be a honor to meet you one day. That would be just a take my breath away experience for me. But my only questioned I would have for you is how did you get yourself started in the field of culinary? I think you might have said that you didn't go to a culinary school or anything like that, but where did you begin? I'm going to school for baking/fine gourmet and I would love to work in a bakery for starters. So what would or could you give me for advice for starters. Just like you I'm self taught myself. 
BRUNCH WITH BOBBY on the Cooking Channel; best restaurant tips I have gotten in a long time...from poaching eggs to making spreads. Great show, Bobby!
My husband and I loved Iron Chef tonight using Papaya. Your dishes looked delicious!
Just thought of something here..My Friend Cindy,who owns a local Pizzaria called Tony Pepperoni's,has claimed to have had won an award for her Pressed Caban Sandwiches..soooo..I thought,"Hey! this could make for an interesting Throwdown!" Agree? I think It'll finally put Hudson,FL. on the map! You in?
Also,another Resteraunt here has the most delicious Philly Steak Sands here in Hudson.."The Best Of Philly"! (There's another "Best of" in NPR,But,I'm not talking 'bout that!)
Bobby I just watched Best Thing I Ever Ate (Bacon) They talked about a Bacon and Onion Compote, how would I go about recreating that?
Hi Bobby, I have some great recipes I would lovee to share with you here in Chicago:)
My husband and I ate at Mesa Grill while in NYC on our honeymoon this past August...it was the culinary highlight of the trip. What I remember most fondly is the corn we ordered as a side dish...corn, grilled cactus, cotija cheese...amazing. You wouldn't consider sharing a recipe? :)
I have a question! Went to BBP in Philadelphia last night! Great tream in there! BUT when I got home my sweet potato fries wasn't in the bag! But my Burger was gteat! Also could u please bring the S.C. Burger back please!!????
Throwdown is now on at Food Network and i'm having a FIT with my father because he wants to watch the AUSTRALIAN OPEN. now, great. i'm missing out on a good show. 
Saw you at the track meet on Saturday. I thought about challenging you to a throw-down but my team would have none of it. Good to see your daughter qualify.
bobby, ok,...i have a question for you. my family's real estate business is working with caesars entertainment, at developing a caesars palace, phu quoc, vietnam. will you be interested, in opening, a mesa grill restaurant at that location? send a message,...to me. best wishes, thao =o> mobile (202) 378-3138 skype name: ngocthaothinguyen

I just want to know where you find the energy to do all you do!
Just wanted to drop a word of appreciation for doing what you do on television and for having done it so consistently well for so long. Was a guest on Food Network years ago, had more than a taste of what it takes, and seen a lot of folks come and go. Kudos to you!
Bobby, luv ya babe, let's do lunch. Have your people call my people. Ok, seriously, though. When is Bobby's Burger Palace coming to the Washington, DC, area? We have some great burger joints, but we need some FLAYvor.
what is a good marinade for Elk sirloin roast?
Hey Bobby, wanted to ask, what's something new and exciting we could do with London Broil? 
Chef Flay, I have a question about balsamic reductions. I have tried and tried to make a good reduction and just can't seem to quite get it. I use above average balsamic vinegar and have followed several recipes; it's getting expensive to find the right one. Can you help me out with a basic balsamic reduction recipe and method for pork, fish or chicken? With respect, Brad
Chef how would like to sponsor an award winning high school culinary team? We'd love to have your logo on our coats
Hey Bobby, just wondering why you were not on the Next Iron Chef this season, you are the reason why I watch it.
Hey bobby just watched the episode the best burger Iever had and was wondering if your burger palace would be making its way down to florida? Orlando, miami, I'll make the drive
Hey Bobby .... my family and I watch throw down religiously... Its our favorite food network show hands down..we even DVR it when new episodes come on.. Will you ever be filming one in the detroit area soon..? Or michigan for that matter?... We would love to come out and support...! Thanks for the great shows........
Bobby - My daughter is turning eight during April. When is a good time to get her cooking? Also, she wants to meet you - we missed you in Raleigh - when will you be out in Oakland/SF/Pleasanton
Fantastic to have you here! :D I 'm from Mxico and I love to see your programs (all of them) and see how you have adopted our flavour! in some of your recipes using Mexican Ingridientes, I Think Mxico is world wide well known for its gastronomy. My son just turned 7, quoting here: "When I grow up, I want to be a chef, like Bobby Flay, because hes the BEST ever in a million zillion" ;) *Warm greetings and hugs from Mxico!*
Hi Booby! I watched you on Iron Chef last night. The chicken egg, pretty cool. How many shows have you done? What was your most challenging secret ingredient?
hey bobby i am going to school for culinary and wondering if you have any tips for a beginner 
I am watching you on Iron Chef right now in which you are showcasing "papaya"...unbelievable...you always hit the ball out of the park! So enjoyable to watch:-)
The Papaya episode on Iron Chef America... simply AMAZING! Do you ever post the recipes for any of those dishes? They were all simply divine.
I loved meeting you in Scottsdale, AZ at a book signing. Watch you all the time from throwdowns to iron chef you are one amazing chef. Going to Vegas in April and looking forward to eating a Mesa grill it would be awsome if you were there to cook it for me:)
Will there be another season of Grill It? I just cleared the snow off my grill.
just watched the racy Tracy omelet throwdown for the third time 
I like your style of cooking and attitude, I've followed you work since I met you once back in the day when you were "Grillin' and Chillin'". Sets and atmosphere has changed a bit. 
what bacon do you use on your burgers ? 
When will you be at Bobby Flay Steak next? Eaten there at least 8 times, just waiting for a chance to meet you!
Steelers and the Bears !. I live about 30 minutes from Arlington, not going to be anywhere close to that place on Superbowl day !!.
Packers and Steelers in the SB!
Hi Bobby. This week my mother started watching Throwdown and I shortly joined in watching it with her. The other day you had a throwdown with Blueberry Pancakes. Tonight my mother made your recipe, and let me tell you Bobby, they were out of this world. The best pancakes I've ever eaten in my life. I look forward to watching more Throwdown.

Bobby do you have a book out on the great sauces you make??? You always add a special sauce to your dishes.(or most of them) Would love to have some of those recipes!!!
I would have to say one of my all time favorites is bbq spicy wings! But this year I wanted to add another appetizer like quesadilla's and some guacamole dip on the side and of course french fries! I am a huge fan of your work, your cooking style is so interesting to watch! Not to mention love your showSS.

I "liked" this page to tell you how upset I am over your service. This is the second time this week I have had a problem with you guys. You guys put the wrong route on the package (I know it was not the seller since he put route 519). And you did it again today. My package is only 15 minutes away on another truck and now I have to wait till tomorrow or pick it up at the service center which is farther away. I used to love your service until this crap happened. I am going back to USPS and fedex!!
I have to "like" this page just to post? Well, I don't particularly "like" UPS right now. I've sat at home for two days straight waiting on a package that will apparently never arrive. Care to compensate me for the two days of work I've missed? 
Is it really a money saving step or is it to much trouble to ring the door bell and hand it to someone. I really hate when your driver leaves packages outside of my garage door? It is 32F out side and most of my orders are computer parts. Not so good for computer parts especially if it snows on them and the plastic bag is not sealed. 
Love Logistics? You guys LOST one of our packages. How does that happen? Okay, fine, sh*t happens, but you REFUSE to reimburse our small business the amount we claimed? This is poor business and we're not going down without a fight.
My UPS driver not only brings treats for my dog when he delivers to the house he also stops and throws a treat when we're on our walk. It is very appreciated!
I ordered some items from a website expecting them to be delieved by you guy today, which I needed TODAY, TUESDAY JANUARY ELEVENTH. I've been sitting here expecting it to arrive to only find you you took it to the damn post office to be delievered tomorrow. WTF? Good job UPS, you fail.
How come your tracking updates don't actually update anymore?? What I mean is... I will only get a notification that it left its origin and another notification when it gets delivered. What happened to scanning items in at every location they hit? And even when you guys do scan it in, for some reason it doesn't hit your system for DAYS. Fix immediately or I will not use UPS any more! EVERRR
seriously you should prolly go out of business. packages never get anywhere as you can tell from all the angry customers that you have and if they do finally make it to it's destination it's prolly bout 3 months late. either you drivers need a map and some redbull, or you guys are just lazy
I am noticing a lot of complaints on here. I have one myself...placed an order on 1/10/11. Paid extra for 2 day delivery...it is now 1/15/11. Where's my damn shipment. You suck UPS. Will NOT be using your services ever again!
What can Brown do for you? THanks again ! Being in the right place at the right time! ON Friday there was a fire in my complex/ The delivery driver spotted the fire and called 911. He also responded by trying to get others out of the 8 plex building. Be fire safe check your extinguisher buy a new one every year and practice with the old one IF you have never had a fire or been around an emergency you are lucky I have had a grease fire , car fires, anyway take a minute and PLAN for disaster!!!! 
I have been disrespected, lied to on multiple occasions, and I have lost complete faith in and loyalty to this brand. I am having an incomparably terrible experience with your company. I've spoken with several UPS customer service representatives and their supervisors - one of whom promised to follow up with me today but did not - and the situation has not improved or been resolved. I want my package, which if it arrives tomorrow - and I'm not holding my breath - will be 8 days late, and I want the $17.95 shipping charge refunded. $17.95 is essentially nothing to UPS, a company Forbes ranked 139 last year on The Global 2000 with a market value of $58.43 billion, and its the least UPS can do to retain a loyal customer.
What is the deal with all the delays in Georgia (USA)? A package I was waiting on sat at the UPS location for 9 days before finally being sent out, 3 of those are days when I know UPS was delivering because they were in my neighborhood, yet I was still told it was being held due to snow. Now, another package is being held for "adverse weather conditions" and it is only raining out. There is no snow on the ground, all the ice has melted and yet UPS is just sitting on packages. 
Thanks to UPS I have just experienced the worst customer service follow through of my whole life. I been in business shipping products for over 20 years, so congrats, you did it. In regards to one specific package, I was apologized to and told what would happen next on 4 seperate occassions over a period of 4 days by 4 different supervisors at the prefered customer support number. Of course what they said would happen never did. Good job. What UPS needs to do is to allow their supervisors send either an email or fax to customers stating what was discussed and how they are resolving the situation. It's the only way you will be able to instill some sense of accountability and follow through with your employees. Once again, good job on your WORST FOLLOW THROUGH EVER AWARD. As an added bonus, your mistakes cost my company $2,000 of money I will never recover. 
So I had a package that didn't get delivered properly. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, a delivery center gets called and fixes it. No, instead I had one helpful person at the main corporate number and then a series of less useful people up to the point of it being implied it was my fault. My solution? Next time, I use FedEx.....or the USPS......or even delivery by bicycle courier.
I called UPS Customer Service and said that it was on the way to me, but its 8:40 P.M. whats the lastest they can deliver? I absolutely need it by today! btw i got Next Day Air and it was ordered off the website wednesday so it should be here by today? right?
Ever wonder why UPS only has just under 6000 "likes".....Because it is the WORST mailing business to work with in the World. Not customer service friendly, and it is like pulling teeth to get a package. Go with the USPS concept of delivering a package (Let us pick it up at OUR convenience) and you will do well for yourselves. UNLIKE!
You guys SUCK!!!! Never delivered on time!!!! And never sent anything on time! Layers! Fedex rules!!!!!

I have a wonderful story to share with you. 1st of all, my son LOVES Monster Jam; and I would like to thank you for doing such a good job sponsoring it! He loves Grinder; and so of course, our mission this Christmas was to find him a Grinder truck. My husband has searched a couple of your stores and was unable to find the truck. One day, he happened to call your store in Shenandoah, PA and was told they had some in stock. He immediately raced to the store, only to find no trucks on the shelf. John Seasock happened to be buying all the trucks as my husband was there. Knowing how much my son loves the Grinder truck, John proceeded to GIVE my husband one of the trucks he was buying!!!! Our son was so excited to open his new truck on Christmas. Kudos to one extraordinary person and Monster Truck Driver--we love you John!!

I sure did enjoy seeing an visiting w/all the Advance Auto Parts team last night! 
WTF? I am a mobile mechanic in Michigan. I did a water pump on a 2001 Dodge van 318, after 10 days the damn thing was leaking out of the shaft, less than 100 miles. I took it off this morning went and got a replacement and it started leaking out of the shaft even worse. Brand new Chinese Water Pump. I quit buying parts at Murry's 5 years ago because of the same problem with Alternators, but I love the service and treatment I get from Andy and his crew at #06193. There are a couple of guys there I try to avoid, but for the most part service is Great

Everyday heros can come from within upper management , I would like to thank our new District leader Anthony Gainey for showing concern for a pregnant team member in our store today. Anthony noticed our team member setting a planogram for seals and bearings, Anthony put together a rolling stool for our team member in an effort to make her more comfortable. Now that's worth more than any bonus, knowing that he cares so much. My hats off to you Anthony. Thank you.

Here's the recipe for Asian Pork Lettuce wrap.
Question: If it were possible would any of you be willing to give up a few IQ points in exchange for the ability to eat whatever you want without gaining a pound?
It's a hit. Bay scallops and portabello mushrooms--a perfect 10-minute meal.
Shrimp Carbonara is unimaginably delucious and YES it's a 10-minute baby!!!! Those are buttery bread crumbs on top. You could skip that. But Christian asks why? He's skinny.
I could like somthing like 10 minute meals, especially if they're tasty.
French Onion Soup. Luscious soup for lousy weather. Simple and soothing.
Asian Pork Lettuce wrap....Very Spicy but the lettuce cools the fire! Very nice for those of us trying to watch the carbs. Recipe coming in about an hour.

Aap har Big Bazaar mein Jaye Lekin PUNE ke FATIMA NAGAR Wale Big bazaar mein mat jaye. Kyunki waha ke Manager toh Apne aap ko Big Bazaar ka Founder hi samaj te hai saath hi saath Staff bhi apne aap ko Kam nahi samaj te. Mein aapko isliye bata raha hoon Kyunki waha pe mere saath bahut bekar tarike se baat ki hai. Jab mein manager ke pass Complaint Karne gaya Toh manager bolte hai Hum ise Big Bazaar ki post se nikal rahe hai. Lekin jab mein agle baar Shopping Karne gaya Toh wo hi bandha Big Bazaar ke Cash counter pe Dikha. Iska matlab aap samaj hi rahe honge. Suppose apke saath aisa hota toh aap kya karte... mein toh Bolta hoon Big bazaar se jane se accha MORE (Aaditya Birla Group) jaye.

WOW! What a trip!" Thanks to Deb Kovalycsik, the Grand Prize Winner from Food Lion's Perfect Pairings Sweepstakes, for sharing her experience of a lifetime in Napa Valley. Deb spent three nights and four days in the heart of Napa Valley, where she savored a four course gourmet meal on the antique Napa Valley Wine Train and visited the Hess Collection Winery, a destination "not to be missed," Deb said.
We shopped at 2 food lions today. The first one, had ALL the lights on in the deli, it was just after 7pm, and the manager said the deli has been closed for hours, because a employee hurt her self and no one could replace her. I guess no one knew how to turn the lights off either...
I am finding this new change of software the hugest hassle I've ever dealt with. We have many issues ane NO ONE seems to know what happened or how to help us. The guy my husband just talked to didn't even know the new number to payroll. We are going on three days of phone calls and nothing is getting solved. Why? Is there anyone out there who is willing and has the authority to help us without having to take our number so they can talk to their boss and then we never get a return call?
Went in to get a rotisere chicken yesterday. The chickens were done (not turning at all)but the girl working the area was putting new product out. When I asked bout a chicken she said it would be at least 20 minutes cuz she'd have to find the plastic boxes to put them in. I was so upset. But I went to plan B and left the store = but mad. I mean, she had a customer who had made a special trip for the chicken and she couldn't be bothered! Husband called later & the manager apologized and is giving me a free chicken! Now that's a turn around! I certainly didn't expect it and would have never asked. Glad managers are trained in good customer service. Thanks Mat!

I just shopped at Foodlion in Savannah. I noticed either this week or last week their has been a MAJOR Shift in prices. Things that have been brought up in my previous posts have been addressed. FoodLions prices either through price reduction or Long Term MVP(6months -1year+) has brought their prices Inline with the competitors in the area. Thank you for bringing your prices back to a reasonable level. Next thing that needs to be addressed is Double Coupons. **ALL** Grocery Store Competitors in this area Double Coupons. FoodLion needs to follow.
No offense, why have I seen dramatic price increases in your stores over the past week or so? Why? I don't see any improvements in the stores in Wake County. I can now shop Lowes Food and be very competitive with most items. That's a huge shocker! Do you understand the repercussions of raising your prices on products? Show us something for our money if we're going to invest another 10% + at the store. I'm very happy that there's more options than FL and Lowes...thank the Lord! We will continue to do some business with FL but I'm shocked to say the least.
Lowes Food wins us 75% of the time due to efficiency at the check out and appearance that their Bakery, Deli, and Seafood departments are cleaner and provide fresher foods. Their beer and wine selection is much larger. I have started going to an old IGA to find value in frozen foods, huge transition for our family. Anything to save a buck$$$$
How about a store that pays it employee's minimum wage and keeps them there for over 2 years !!!!! The Food Lion in West Ashley ,SC has some great employee's that actually work and care about their place of employment, yet they keep getting the run around when they ask for a raise or were told they merit one at their review!!!! yet their managers get trips on the company to Hawaii and other bonuses, yet, they keep stringing their employees along with lies????? No wonder the country is so disatisfied with low paying jobs!!!!!! Yes , they are grateful for their employment, but never get anywhere no matter how hard they work,come in when called on their days off, never call out!!!!! WOW !!!! Thats the kind of Company I wished I worked for dont you...thats why I have stopped shopping there or any of their stores....Kepp up the good work Food Lion.....your employee's appreciate it!!!!! Does the same thing happen in the Food Lion you work In????????

Ok I could of been wrong but I was sure my local Food Lion used to double coupons. I was so disappointed when I went yesterday and learned they don't. I had a bunch of coupons I expected to double at the register! I will just have to stick with Kroger and Publix as they both double and take competitor's coupons. I am new to couponing so I have to go where the deals are!
Is the Coca cola/planters deal for only specific items? Or any Coke/Planters products?
I can't omagine me siging up for Food Lion on Facebook.

I got a text last week for a free Dole salad if I text back Salad to Food Lion. I was excited until I went into every store me and realized none of them carry dole salad they only carry fresh express. No free salad for me :-(
can we print off our score showing 10 correct on the produce game and bring in since it won't pull up coupon?
i really did not want to put Jim Williamson on blast, because i usually just brush of ignorance. This incident happened saturday around 3 pm at Store 2530 somerset center dr. winston-salem nc. I went in the store to cash my payroll check so i could by my sick wife some meds and to get a few other things. To Mr. Williamsons DISCRMINATION he did not feel comfortable cashing my payroll check. He told me that it up to him and he didn't feel good about it. With proper identification I do not see why he wouldn"t cash it for me. The racism was so in my face, that it caught me off guard. How can you have someone in management that is racist to the community that spends their hard earned money in your establishment and the fact that I had a sick wife at home and couldn't purchase meds for her really pissed me off.. Mr Jim Williamson needs a reality check, one day he may cross a person in the wrong way and that might be his last cross. Sincerely Mr. Pearsall

I've been trying to locate an advertisement Pez of a Food Lion Truck. Pez website says that it was released in October I think. I have a collector bro. inlaw that has alerted me to this phenom. I'm in Frederick, MD, and the stores nearby seem to know nothing about them. . .any suggestions or info?

do you ever put your orange juice concentrates (canned) on sale? I keep looking. ;-)
I tasted the Food Lion brand Mini Ravioli the other day and noted that it was too sweet so I compared the sugar content to the name brand and sure enough...an additional gram of sugar...is this how you get kids to like your brands better? 
I have a suggestion. Instead of giving away 'big' prizes like trips and money and such, why not just go back to doubling coupons? I rarely use coupons (and therefore buy much less that I would) at Food Lion instead of opting to use them elsewhere. If you started doubling again, you'd get more of my business.
Hey Food Lion, I'd love for you to carry Back 9's Buffalo Chicken Dip in my local store -- 237 Mt Holly Huntersville Rd in Charlotte, NC. How can we make this happen?

Original BSG comic I made!
Hey guys, does anyone know where i can find a 3 inch titanium model of Starbuck's Viper II other than on Amazon? Just missed out on one on eBay :( :( :( Kicking myself! :( Really need one for when Katee Sackhoff comes down to New Zealand for the Armageddon Expo. I LOVE BSG and an opportunity to have Starbuck sign her own Viper is pretty much once in a lifetime. Any info would be much appretiated! :) Oh and the Battlestar Galactica take of Bohemian Rapsody is really good. Highly recommended to any BSG fan :)
finally finished watching the series, just have razor to go.... (then caprica) DVD release didnt hit Austria for 4th season till now.
just discovered you bunch of nutters here and it gives me goosebumbs to see there are so many others like me! So say we all!
Didn't really get into Caprica. Looking forward to seeing Blood and Chrome. Give me some good ol' space dogfights.
just finished BSG///ummm...it was great.....but the ending was too long....the EARTH scenes was too long.......still one of the best though...
Just watched this again... now addicted again have to find complete seris to watch
BSG amazing what some people can imagine <3 ;)
i love bsg its the best fucking show ever cylons are sweet comment this with what your viper fighter callsign would be mine flapjack :)
just started watching all over again, I love it!
just started watchin the show on dvd and i wonder why i did not watch this when it was on then i say to my self thats right lost was on. but bsg is way way way better 
Just finished the final season. That was the best ending to a show I have ever seen!!
Just started, episode 1 season 1- I am in love.
I cant believe how real and gritty battlestar galactica is! I am blown away by the depth and theological allegory the show represents totally mind blowing stuff! And this is just from the 10th episode of the fist series! I am a battlestar galactica addict
i finished the series second time, and i feel again like first time, i feel emptiness for the show, i feel loneliness about the characters, im really emptied and i want more and more to fill this hole in me
I just finished Ep 17 of Season 3. I'm going to finish the remaining 3 episodes tonight. Now, I just have to find Season 4. btw, I'm trying my absolute best to not read any posts on this wall for I suspect there are spoilers. Please don't ruin it for those who haven't finished it. Thanks...
I've watched it twice already, and I'm on my third currently, in season 2. I've never seen a deeper, more real, believable, action-packed, or beautiful show as this. A masterpiece for the freaking ages. But I still haven't seen The Plan!

Hi All! I have scoured the internet and can't find anything to help me. I was given the complete series as a Christmas present. It comes with a smart booklet that makes claims there are special features on a number of the discs (Region 2) - namely, commentaries. However, almost all of them appear to have none. I can't find a thing! Can anyone help me? I have checked the audio track and there appears to be only one, so I am stumped. Can anyone help?
I hated the finale...I was actually pissed off at it.
Just started watching this after missing it on TV - only up to Episode 8. Fantastic back-story. Love what they've done to the original, and to keep the Mark 2's!
I need help just finshed season 2 and i want to find out what happens to pegasus and dont know what to watch the webisodes or bsg season 3 please help asap. -- SO SAY WE ALL!!!!
Just finished the blue ray boxed set and was mostly disappointed with season 5. 
I just watched the entire series on Netflix in about 3 weeks. All I can say is "AMAZING!". It has literally ruined other television for me.
Just got into BSG on Netflix and watched it all in about two weeks. WOW, this has got to be one of the best shows I have ever watched. I am a fan for life.

I just finished season 4!!!!! Love it!!
spoilers....
Just finished all the seasons!!!!!!!!!!! great show
just got through season 3 damn it was good going to buy season 4 and 5 soon then watch the plan!!
I love this show, but I wish there had been more youngsters, like in the original. They had Boxey in the pilot, but that was it. That's the only serious gripe I had about it, otherwise it was a great show. The space battles were the best I've ever seen.
I've just finished a BSG re-watch after watching all the Caprica episodes and found that it gave even more depth to BSG. What an incredible show. Highly recommend a post Caprica watch. Now bring on Battlestar Galactica:Blood & Chrome. When's that coming out?
Just finished the series again. The ending has to be one of the most realistic in tv show history. Such a delicate balance of sadness and hope and realism. It proves to move me every time I watch it.
I want to watch this serie again and again and again... :) have a nice day...:) ... (just for info ;) 
I think I've only seen part of one of the new Battlestar Galactica series where they just discovered a means of detecting the cylons amongst the humans. If you google CIA history, you'll learn about Acoustic Kitty from the 1960s. What you won't learn is that the Acoustic Kiddy was born in the 1970s. Now we are turning middle age and aghast nothing more has been done to put the science into science fiction.
Finally saw the finale to Caprica. I think the show ended prematurely.
dont you love watching galactica and saying "what the FRAK just happened"
hell... i feel somtething empty after final of BG.... i'll miss it 
After watching Caprica Final season, Just finished Battlestar Galactica Marathon.. it's frakin' awesome.. though I thought the 7'th cylon was Daniel Graystone, unfortunately it's not....
Just finished the series. AGAIN. The ending has to be one of the most realistic in TV show history. Such a delicate balance of sadness and hope and realism. It proves to move me over and over every time I watch it. What a shame it didn't find a broader mainstream audience. I try not to be elitist about our baby because I love sharing it with non-SciFi fans. 
best series ever --not only the scifi-- full epic stories.. the only show superior to the original (why it must ended?) Just start watching the caprica.. hope it wouldn't spoil the cylon's :)
One off, if not the, best sci-fi series (concept?) ever. The mini series that startet it all off is truly epic! A masterpiece! 
I just got a battlestar blue ray box set! OMG! best t.v. show i have ever seen!
I started watching this TV series this week and It is very addictive. The idea of M/C believing in God and Prophesy of being fruitfulness is what makes this Sci-Fi series different from other famous Sci-fi series. I am loving this. 
I just watched the entire series for the first time in less than a month and boy, is my projected consciousness tired.
that's just .... perfect so far ... in Haste to see the very end ...
I picked up the first season of this show about a week ago cause my brother in law loves it and said I would like it. Like it is a bit of an understatement lol. I love this show and am hooked. I now own seasons 1, 2.0, and 2.5 and am flying through them!
I just read all your comments. Am I the only one who fondly remembers the original series?
After watching the entire show from front to back, including razor and caprica, I was left with one option...WATCH IT ALL OVER AGAIN! I just finished season 3 and waiting on season 4. In my opinion, season 3 has been the best so far, it takes a turn here, getting deeper into human cylon connection and further from our separation which comes from all interesting angles of all the key characters. So far, it's better a second time over!
People say that the last 5 minutes of Battlestar Galactica ruin the entire show, well here is how they're wrong. Firstly it shows us that Hera really was The Shape of Things to Come as she was the farthest back genetic ancestor to modern humans. The main part that people complain about is that the final moment just throws it to "God", but really it doesnt, what it really does is show that this thing that everyone had been going on about isnt really God but part of a more advanced culture that has the ability to manipulate our universe and guide certain people to certain paths via "angels" who are just the workers of said entity, because as "angel" Giaus said "It doesnt like to be called God." So really what it did was to show that there was a more powerful force that we just cant fully understand therefore we call it "God" when really it's just part of a thing just as Human as everyone else, but just a bit more complex.
So someone help me with my failing memory... I'm watching season 1 episode 15 right now, Kara just killed the SIX to get the arrow, Helo & Sharon show up, Kara tries to shoot Sharon... what I can't recall is how and when did Kara figure out that Sharon was a Cylon? Thanks. 
It took me 3 years to appreciate this amazing show. I made the mistake to try watching a random episode and the razor movie. I ended up listening regularly to the soundtrack during all that time wondering what made tis series so special. This series isn't like Star Trek where continuity was not necessarily required. You need to start from the begin until BSG becomes unforgiveable and sucks you down into its deep story full of emotions, survival instinct, conspiracies and the search for Earth. Love it! So say we all! :)
just got into this show , wow what an impressive story line! its a lot like a book you just cant put down ! love it!
I just watched this show on netflix! I AM HOOKED! BRILLIANT STORYLINE!
Just finished the Series after 2 years.... i miss it already.
Just Like Death is a Point of View to Lookback on Life , so do these Imagined Possible End-OF Humanity type Sci-Fi series ( eg Battlestar Gallactica) provide us, who dream and wonder, with a perch from which to consider the role of Humanity going forward into space. TWH stardate 0124.2011 
I just finished watching the series through for the second time, how could it be better the second time than the first. I don't know but it was! Thank Gods for Netflix! This was just an amazing show, too good to put into words! SO SAY WE ALL!
This show started so well, its gutting to see how crap the 3 rd and last season were, in fact season 2 finale was poor, Oh well.
I never watched the original 70s Battlestar show... are there nods to the original hidden in the new series? Can you recall any scecifics? 
Boy, if I were Lee Adama, I would definitely lose it, in the last episode, turn around and see that Starbuck disappeared, that is not cool ... 
Just bought the complete series of BSG on blu-ray. I feel like a kid with candy.
just finish it, for so weird reason the ending make me smile. and what is Blood and Chrome?
I just am a bit confused so what was Starbuck, she is not a cylon and what about Baltzar what was he. I seen the whole series and have so many questions but I loved it. I am going to rent Caprica which is also on Netflix and what is Blood and Chrome? Very intrigued and hoping to see more BSG, I wished they could make an extension of BSG but in todays age and explore how we are the descendants of BSG!
i jus lost the weirdest bet my friend told me that the 12 colonies were named after zodiac signs idk wth r zodiac signs so i said she was wrong then she showed me her zodiac chart thingy and she was right -_-*
Season 2, episode 9, I just got pretty teary eyed (again) when Chief finished the Blackbird & Christened it the 'Laura'. 
Just started watching this phenomenal show thru Netflix. OMG I cannot stop watching! Curse you, never-ending school for not letting me watch this show at its peak. Still tho, I'm halfway through Season 3 ( I just started 2 weeks ago). <3 BSG Marathons!
Today in Geek History 1/27/1980: The Battlestar Galactica spin-off Galactica 1980 begins its run on ABC. (from "Today in Geek History" for Android)
admiral adama is bad ass. just sayin'.
Guys, I have Reson to think I'm a Cylon lmao! I got that "All Along The Watch Tower" song from the "CrossRoads" episode, and ever since I keep singing it in my head every 5 secconds, the same words, lol, but still, Battlestar Galactica is one awesome show, I haven't seen any further episodes than the 2nd one after "Cross Roads pt 2" soo... ya, but still awesome!!
I was such a skeptic of this show (since I was a big fan of the original) until it was available for streaming instantly onto my Xbox. So much for my contempt prior to investigation. I just started to watch the first season of episodes and I thought to myself: "What the frak was I thinking?!? This show is very good!"
Anybody know the name and where i can get the Piano piece that Starbuck puts on in her appartment in Season 2 Episode 1?? It's the song her Dad is s'posed to be playing. Love it and really want it. Cheers in advance.
I miss BSG. Was just watching the eps where Gaeta started the mutiny and ended up getting killed for treason. Brilliant. Although I always thought they were alluding he was a Cylon when Baltar says "I know who you are". A little over dramatic if it wasn't building to something. Still great though. Bring BSG back!
just started watchin it. Love it :)
How can brits do the "american accent" so well. It's almost surreal to hear what Jamie Bamber( Lee Adama) really sounds like ..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L03_fizTFwI
Let me preface this by saying I have never seen the original. I just finished watching the re-imagined series on Netflix Instant. It is the greatest television series I have ever seen. The acting, directing, production and converging themes of war, politics, theology, science, etc. are mind bending. I am watching it again. So say we all
I just watched Razor for the first time. It was a bit redundant after watching the entire series, but I loved seeing everyone. I'm missing Starbuck all over again.
OMG OMG Just finished BSG season 3. OMG. <3 BSG Marathons!
just started season 3!!! wow!!!! Great show!
anyone is staying in singapore? Looking for people to play the boardgame
Just discovered Battlestar via Netflix... am hooked, and am into season 2. Starbuck is Wonderwoman and I can't help loving the Sharons, even though I know I shouldn't. And I agree, Mark: Adama would easily beat Picard...
Just started streaming this show on Netflix. Oh "Battlestar Galactica," where have you been all my life? I'm so sorry that I have neglected you until now! As sacrilegious as it may be to admit this, I think BG may be overtaking "Star Trek: The Next Generation" as my all-time favorite show.
Whats the deal with Lee getting fat? Kinda goofy for such a great show.
I hear there's a new series on the way, somewhere between Caprica and BSG...dealing with the first cylon war. Syfy ordered the pilot. Should be out by year's end.
I just watched the final season this past weekend, and I have to admit I thought they could have done a better ending. Just what, I'm not sure. I was told that in a blog by one of the writers that by season 4 they were making it up as they went along. I think the ending showed that.
Only Edward James Olmos can tell the difference between a human,a cylon and a replicant. 
met Richard Hatch a few years back with my son he was at Comicon what a nice guy took several minutes of his time to talk and joke with my son and I at that point he said he would not be apart of a new show I guess everyone is entitled to change their minds I am glad he did

Swiss Chard and White Bean Stew for dinner tonight. Find the recipe in Ultimate Pressure Cooker Book.
Josephine's Recipe (like this photo to vote for this recipe) Chicken with Bow Tie Pasta and Vodka Sauce Ingredients 1 lb. frozen skinless, boneless chicken breasts ( see note below) 1 lb. sliced mushrooms or you can use a large can of mushrooms 1 - 24 oz. jar of Vodka Sauce ( I used Bertolli) 2 cloves of garlic, minced 2 cups dry Bow tie pasta 1/2 cup chicken broth 6 large Basil leaves, torn, save some for garnish 1/2 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper ( use less or omit, but it gives it a nice flavor) Grated Parmesan cheese for garnish. Note: My chicken breasts were frozen in one section.That was a thick piece of chicken. So the cooking time was longer. If you have chicken tenders the cooking time would be less. This took 25 minutes for my chicken. It should take 20 minutes if using tenders. Directions Place the frozen chicken in the Pressure Cooker pot Add the pasta, garlic, mushrooms, salt, red pepper, basil, broth and Vodka sauce. Set Pressure cooker to Meat Function and the timer for 25 minutes. I quick released mine. Garnish with Basil and Parmesan Cheese.
Scott's Recipe (like this photo to vote for this recipe) BBQ Beef two to three pounds of beef roast 1/4 dehydrated onions 2 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon garlic powder I put the beef roast into pressure cooker, add the pepper, onions and garlic powder fill with water to cover beef. Set it to a low heat and let it simmer for a couple of hours. You want to cook the meat till it is so tender it comes apart with a fork. Now take the meat out and shred into a casserole dish. At this point I cut up an onion and put into mine but you can leave it out. add your favorite bbq sauce (Texas style) stir and place into cooker till all ingredients have warmed back up and onions soften Put on buns and serve MMMMMMM
Phoenix's Recipe (like this photo to vote for Phoenix) 20 MINUTE BEEF STEW (Made twice already in Wolfgang Puck's 5 qt. pressure cooker) Beef chuck is a good choice for stew meat. From the muscular shoulder section, this tough cut becomes tender and succulent when stewed. Here, we speed the process by using a pressure cooker. Ingredients: 3 lb. boneless stewing beef, cut into 1-inch cubes (frozen or thawed) 1/3 cup all-purpose flour Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste 3 Tbs. olive oil 1 1/2 cups red wine (optional, can substitute an extra 1 1/2 beef stock instead) 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 4 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 celery stalks, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1/2 lb. new potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (I used about 6 medium potatoes) 1 Tbs. tomato paste 1 1/2 cups beef stock 3 fresh thyme sprigs Directions: In a large bowl, toss the beef with the flour, salt and pepper to coat evenly. Set an electric pressure cooker to "brown" according to the manufacturer's instructions and warm the olive oil. Add half the beef and brown on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with the remaining beef and transfer to the bowl. Add the wine (or half the beef stock) to the pressure cooker and bring to a simmer, stirring to scrape up the browned bits. Add the beef, onion, garlic, carrots, celery, potatoes, tomato paste, stock and thyme and stir to combine. Cover and cook on "high" for 20 minutes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Release the pressure according to the manufacturer's instructions. (With the WP pressure cooker, I let the steam release on its' own). If the liquid is too thin, transfer the beef and vegetables to a serving bowl, set the pressure cooker to "brown" and cook until the liquid is reduced to the desired consistency. Pour the liquid over the beef and vegetables and serve immediately. Serves 6. **Tastes even more yummy with dumplings. I made mine using Jiffy Mix and the recipe on the box.
Shari's Recipe )to vote for Shari, "like" this photo) Butternut Squash Soup 4 cups Butternut Squash, peeled, seeded and cubed 2 large frozen boneless , skinless chicken breasts 1 can coconut milk 1 sprig of Sage 1 Large Onion, chopped 1/2 piece of fresh ginger 1/4 teaspoon, nutmeg If you don't have fresh ginger just use 1/2 teaspoon pumkin pie spice 4 cups vegetable stock olive oil salt and pepper to taste 1/2 cup of Toasted Pumpkin Seeds, for garnish In the open pressure cooker turned on with the top off, soften onions with the sage, salt and pepper. When the onions are soft, move over onions to the side,add handful of squash cubes to cover the bottom, let brown for for about 10 minutes stirring infrequently. Next, add the rest of the squash, ginger,nutmeg, or pumkin pie spice plus stock and frozen chicken. Close and lock the lid of the pressure cooker. And use soup mode for about 20 minutes. Once done cooking open lid and add 1 cup coconut milk. Take the chicken out. Be sure to take out out the piece of ginger & sage stem. With a stick blender puree' the contents in the pressure cooker and serve! Dice the chicken and add to soup (or cut into 4 pieces and serve the soup like a sauce on top of the chicken. Garnish with salty, toasted pumpkin seeds. Besides soup,you can use 2 cups stock and don't puree and toss it over cooked boneless chicken breast or thighs and even add quinoa.
Tracey's Recipe (like this photo to vote for Tracey) Pork Chops and Potatoes (Maltese Style) I grew up on this dish and it is so simple to make in the WP Pressure Cooker. 4 - 5 Bone in Pork Chops -frozen or fresh 2 Large Potatoes sliced thick 1/2 an onion sliced Chicken stock Salt and Pepper to taste Thats it! If you would like to add another veggie, carrots work great! You can pretty much throw all the ingredients in any order add the liquid to cover and set the function for meat and 45 minutes. This is such a time saver and who can resist a moist pork chop. The best thing for me is that it brings me back to my Grandparent's table & my Grandmas cooking (it's almost as good as hers!) This is my old school dish made easier with my WP Pressure cooker (just one of my favorite appliances by WP) am I bragging too much?!? Hope you make this one and love it as much as my family does!
Have you ever made your own marshmallows before? See how this family did just that. Mmmmmm!

Meringues, I quit. I've tried 3 times and they're always a disaster. As for a meringue roulade, well that ended up a flat, soggy mess. Hiss!
Great victoria sponge. Kids ate it before I jammed it!
Can't wait for it to start! I made you chocolate victoria filled with cream for my bookclub meeting as it was one of our birthdays it was a huge hit. I also did the sausage & mash canapes from your "Feast" book at a party and they went in no time as predicted - thanks

Cranberry Kuchen coming out of the oven!
I'm pooped. We essentially had our Christmas dinner today. We were all sick over Christmas so we had to cancel my dad's visit. He and my brother just left and the dishes are done. I've been in the kitchen all day and have some yummy new appetizers and biscuits for you!
I'm afraid that the Reese's Peanut Butter Chips are no longer safely tucked away in the cabinet...
just made a Gouda and Sun Dried Tomato Cheese Ball :) Chilling in the fridge for tomorrow. Since I was sick over Christmas we had to cancel dinner. So tomorrow we are having our ham finally. I am thinking of making an Orange Meringue Pie! if I have the energy LOL
I finally have those orange creamsicle cupcakes in the oven and they smell divine! I added a little orange extract an was out of oranges, so I used tangerine zest. Crossing my fingers!
Going to make chicken picatta tonight. I save that last handful of crackers in the box, the half a bowl of corn flakes no one is eating, etc and run them all through the food processor to use as breading. Do you guys do that too?
Espresso Braised Beef in the crockpot for dinner. Love menu planning, no more last minute dinners! What are you having?
I made a Spicy Tomato Bread today. I'm still on the fence about it. I think it's a mental thing. The top have is wonderful, like any quick bread with tons of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg etc, the bottom half is very moist, that's where most of the tomato is. I like it, but I really think my mind is talking me into rejecting it. :-/ It LOOKS amazing.
I am sitting here working on a craft post for The DIY Club and munching on crackers with this leftover cheese ball, YUM! 
The Beef and Sugar Snap Stir Fry had really great flavor, but not enough sauce for me. I think it's because Cooking Light takes as many calories out of the equation as possible. Really good, but I think I'll up the sauce next time. Hope to blog it today. I've stuck to my menu plan so far this week! Woohoo!
I developed this chicken salad recipe for Annie's Recipes, it's really good! Would be awesome in a tortilla or a pita pocket. Mmmmm! http://www.anniesrecipes.com/Recipe/21967/Pecan-Dijon-Chicken-Salad.htm
Peppered Pork Chops tonight, probably rice and brussel sprouts on the side. And you?
Tonight is Beef and Sugar Snap Stir Fry - what are you having? And did you make a menu plan and stick with it this week? Here was mine http://www.amandascookin.com/2011/01/menu-plan-monday.html
Making some really fun cookie pops, so colorful! I also have Megan's Cookin' chocolate coffee truffles in the freezer :)

Beef stew in the crockpot. What are you having for dinner?

Sugar cookie bars are cooling on the counter, I've mixed 5 different colors for frosting (fun!) and am getting ready to post these play dough cookies!
I made Zitronenkuchen yesterday, which is German for Lemon Cake. it's pound cake with lemon glaze, I made them in mini muffin form. Soooooo good! These were for my daughter's German class.
A great day of interviewing our future team is complete. We're excited for you to meet them.
Chicken Tacos...Pulled free range chicken with Southwestern spices, veggies, black beans & rice in organic corn tortillas. Easy, Delicious & Good For You!
Grecian Tilapia...Grilled Greek spiced tilapia with herbed orzo and spicy garlic asparagus. Sometimes just having someone make it for you is the best part. It's nice to have options and you will have over 30 of them very soon.
Good Morning...We're getting the Power Morning Tortilla ready for everyone. A 4:1 egg white scramble with spinach, bell peppers & cheese wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla with a side of pico de gallo.

Welcome to facebook Dashing Dish!!!
Hey Katie! Tonight I made Taco Stuffed Pepper Cups and my husband said, "This is your best meal yet!" And he is a seriously tough critic... I thought it was pretty cool that he likes your recipe better than the "other" stuffed peppers I have made him before (the high cal/fat ones). Wish I would have taken a picture because they sure were pretty! Thanks for your delicious, healthy recipes :-)
Thanks, Dashing Dish for ANOTHER hit!... I made your White Bean Chicken Chili for lunch today and my husband said, "This is the best white chicken chili I have ever had. It is restaurant quality." 
Hi friends! I created this Fan Page so you can show off your Dashing Dish creations. You can tag me in the pictures. Also, now we can have conversations on health, food, and fitness. Leave feedback, ask questions, and anything else you'd like! Thanks for visiting :) ~Katie
love the olive oil spray. love how the food comes to done. 
How many cans of PAM Cooking Spray are in your cupboards?
To help you save time in the kitchen, heres a tip: cut the corner of a regular envelope to create a funnel to pour spices.
Poll: Whats your favorite PAM Cooking Spray? A. Baking B. Grilling C. Original D. Olive Oil E. Butter
Heres a handy tip for the next time you are baking! To make handling the dough easier, first spray your hands with a little PAM! Are you planning on doing any baking this weekend?
If you have leftover veggies from this weeks dinners, try our recipe for Roasted Vegetable Quesadillas. Quick and easy, this option will help you get the weekend started faster! http://bit.ly/g1lzTM
I work for ManGrate and we love your spray. We recommend that all our customer spray in on their grates before using them and for seasoning. Would love to partner with you guys some time.
Not only is PAM great for cooking, but I also use it to knock pesky Hornets out of the sky. I kid you not. The spray coats their wings and they drop to the ground. Much safer than traditional wasp and hornet sprays.
I USE PAN ALL THE TIME. ONE OF MY FAVORITE USES IS WHEN MAKING PASTA, I SPRAY PAM IN THE WATER AND NOODLES NEVER STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE! 
Here is a tip for you that have Directv or any satellite dish. If you get snow that piles up on your dish. before the snow falls just spray the dish with PAM and the snow will just slide off. I hope this will help some one 
I like the Virgin Olive Oil one BEST! :)
wow i just used some pam for my eggs

Its been a long day, 14 hours of following the channels, and its been great. We've received great response from the internet, and we aim to please more in the future. Don't forget to chop the onions.
Swedish Meal Time made it to one of Sweden's coolest sites, Feber. Raise our rating!
Knckte just 5300 views p Meatball Massacre.
22 715 p enbart Meatball Massacre. nnu mer p kanalen. Tack Syd-Korea!
http://svt.se/2.33919/1.2312045/brutala_kockar_gor_succe_pa_natet Featured on the web again, this time on SVT (Sveriges Television / Swedens Television). There are LOTS of errors in the article, about us always beeing in a student kitchen (which is false), cooking with chicken in ChopChopCarnage (also false) and some poorly collected quotes, but what the hell, its TV lmao
No, it's just a Swedish version of regular old meal time. This is just everyday, normal, regular mealtime in Sweden. Nothing epic about it. If it was Epic Swedish Meal Time the planet would probably implode on itself and fall into the fucking sun causing it to collapse into a black hole. PerfectChaosZeta@YouTube Genius.
Episode 3. Sidepork Pandemonium. Release date: Today 19.00 GMT+1
We officially got 100 people liking this page, so I say we celebrate with a beer! SKL!
So tell us, do you guys like Chop Chop? Teaser for tomorrows video:
Can someone who has a Existenz account please email and tell them to link the appropriate source instead?
I think Valhalla have shined down on us this day and rewarded us with a total of 1 000 000 views throughout our whole channel. So on the same weekend we have reached 10 000 subscribers, been featured on Swedish TV two times and made a whole lot new ROSMT fans. We are proud, as should all of you be for being part of something awesome like this. Thank you and...IT'S GOOD FOR YOU!
Informerar att det r 9 277 views p Meatball Massacre nu. Vi har inte rknat med att det skulle vara mngfaldigt mycket mer populrt. Det r skit roligt! Det kommer mera.
I've been sitting at the computer bascially all day (hangover quality time) and it's just so weird and great to see so many people comment and sharing the video. We thought we pulled the last one a little bit too far over the line in madness, but people on the web are obviously mad. Like the mad hatter! He is mad too. I drink water from the tap and am quite neutral in everything I do. Swedish enough for you?
We are smelling something... Is it the production of the 4th episode closing in?
Slightly delayed. Upload problems at YouTube. Should be up within a couple of minutes
YouTube just invited us to be partners.
I don't know how many of you that have read anything about Norse mythology. If you have, it's not hard to understand why Sweden is awsome. That is one BADASS mythology.
Updates: 13 039 views atm. Starting with English updates from now. Mainly for our Korean fanbase (which proves to be quite large atm!1). Next episode is in the making. We want a Swedish blonde girl to eat our food. Because the canadians should be aware that we have ladies here as well! Anyone up to the task? ..............Koreans are probably not on Facebook.
Trolls are all over the internet as always, but I can't help to feel sad for them when they accuse us from "copying" EpicMealTime. We adore EpicMealTime and what they do, and this began merely as a parody. And further, we are cooking extremely, not eating extremely. Haters are welcome, trololol

Hey, when are you all going to release the March dates for Garth? Thanks!
A few weeks back I asked for the recipe for the delicious Chocolate Martinis at Parasol and you instructed me to email them. I have twice and have not yet heard back from them. Any chance you could post the recipe in the 12 Days of Cocktails? I would GREATLY appreciate it. Thanks! See you next month!
I am very sad to hear that ALEX is closing. I would like to extend my condolences and am sure that Wynn|Encore will just find another way to provide it's guests with an amazing dining experience. Also, Wynn Stories is a great idea - Thank You, Wynn|Encore, for having always been and forever being the very best Las Vegas has to offer (let alone the entire world). <3
Which club would you suggest for two couples of 30 somethings on property? I'd love to splurge one night and get a table and bottle service just not sure where??? thanks! If anyone else has suggestions, please share! :) 
SINATRA Dine and Dance with Me! If youre looking for the convenience of planning an entire evening of dining and entertainment for just one price, youll want to consider the new Sinatra Dine and Dance with Me package - which pairs a complete three-course dinner at Sinatra with a ticket to the show, offered for a total price of $145 per person, including tax and gratuity. This special menu like the show, is available nightly, except Sunday, with reservations available from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. For further details please call Show Reservations at (702) 770-WYNN. Were getting hungry!
Shades on the Encore Esplanade is proud to host a Chrome Hearts Trunk Show featuring the Chrome Hearts Diamond Collection. Several exclusive collection pieces including one of a kind jeweled frames will be available. Friday, January 21 and Saturday, January 22 from 12-8.
I am incredibly frustrated with the Wynn. My husband and I booked tickets to see Garth. My husband asked the agent for the best seats available for the weekend of June 3-4. We went on line right after getting off the phone and there were better seats available for 3 of the 4 shows that weekend, including the show we have tickets for. It appears that the Wynn/Ticketmaster don't care about the people spending all this money for seats...they just want the money.
I saw beignets on the room service menu at Encore. Called consierge asking which resto I could get them in. "Can't. But Chef at Society will make you special brioche donuts. What time can we expect you for brekkie?" Really? I wonder if they know I'm a writer or if they treat all their guests this way?
Just got back from staying in the two bedroom suite. I like it better then Encore. Saw Garth last visit in October 2010. He was on break or I would go again. Have ate in most the places In Wynn . My favorite is the Sunday Champange Brunch @ The Country Club. My husband and I love to find the best ones and in Vegas this is it so far.
Having coffee in my room on the 59th floor of Encore Tower Suites, which really isn't the 59th floor because floors 40-49 are missing. Do you know why? (I do, I'm just testing).
Chinese New Year decorations in our Atrium. It's the Year of the Rabbit!
Any chance you can share your recipie on how to make your Margaritas. I live in Australia and came there for my honeymoon. You guys had the best margaritas hands down. Would love to make these at home.
Is there any chance that the Bambu products will ever be sold on-line. When we were last there I puchased the Shaving Cream for my husband & he's almost out of it. We won't be in Vegas for a while & I was really hoping that we could order it on-line but I can't find a link anywhere. Can you please help me? Thanks.
Just had to thank you for a wonderful two nights! LOVED LOVED LOVED the show Sinatra, Dance With Me - Saw it last night and as I was exiting I discovered that I had been sitting directly behind Mr. Wynn and Twyla Tharp - Was very starstruck and didn't have the nerve to gush about the show directly to them. Orchestra - incredible, dancing - sublime (and oh so Twyla!), Sinatra himself has got to be smiling in heaven about this! 
Hi Wynn, I am looking for accommodation for the 28th December 2011 - 3rd January 2012 it is for 5 adults do you have any rooms or suites that you could recommend for us and if they are available and also prices. Do you have any specials for early bookings as well. Sorry about all the questions we are from Australia and are so excited about spending new years in Vegas. Thank you, Shara
Our Cake Artist Flora Aghababyan created this culinary masterpiece for the launch of ticket sales to Bon Appetits 5th annual Vegas Uncorkd. WOW!
Please join us in wishing a very happy birthday to Mr. Wynn!

STB- Did you play in the snow? Did you have any snowball fights? You could build a snowman and call it Mr. Suntrust.
suntrust thanks for the support while I am deployed to Iraq...you have been GREAT!
Hi! I was wondering when you plan to open the Suntrust Bank built at the Rivergate Shopping Center (South Tryon and Walker Branch Drive) in South Charlotte? I was told it would open Summer 2010 but it is still closed. It would be great for this location to open so I wouldn't have to drive to Belmont or the Audrey Kell location. Thank you!
SUNTRUST IS THE WORST BANK EVER! WILL BE CHANGING TODAY!!! IF YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT I WOULD CHANGE BANKS ASAP!
SunTrust is without a doubt the most incredibly unhelpful and unfriendly bank I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. After unsuccesfully trying to refinance my home at least a half dozen times, trying a short sale, applying for a deed in lieu and over a month of phone calls I was finally referred to someone with the knowledge and ability to do something and all he could say is sorry we have a foreclosure date scheduled and we can't postpone it. Stay away!!!!!!!!
Experience the SunTrust difference immediately! Use our online Switch Assistant to open an account, transfer direct deposits, make online payments and more in minutes: http://bit.ly/achQsX.

I need foods that can be prepared ahead of time and transported to feed a family of five! We get so tired of sandwiches, pizza, & the usual tailgate fare!! Also, does anyone have advice about the best way to keep foods warm since it will be in the car?

One of my ALL TIME favorite chocolate shops, Antica Dolceria BONAJUTO in Modica (RG), Sicily. I'm with owners Pierpaolo Ruta and his father, Franco. A little side note...my mum was at a party next door at our neighbor's and met a man whose family was from Modica, though he grew up in Mexico. He was telling my mum about this incredible chocolate maker in Modica and my mom stopped him immediately, told him to hold the thought and upon her return, she would give him her undivided attention. She ran home and returned with a couple of bars of chocolate from.....Antica Dolceria BONAJUTO and he just started crying and squealing because that's the chocolate maker he was going to tell her about and he was sooo excited to eat some of their chocolate. Would NOT share it with anyone. You can see and read more on Eating my way through Sicily Part 1 and In the Making, where you can see the chocolate maker in action.

Hola Yvette! I like my egg bread rosca recipe, which is basically a challah recipe. This year, I added a frangipane, a wonderful almond spread, which upped the bread in delicousness (is that a word?).
Do you have a recipe for tamales with red chicken guisado and one with pork meat? I love tamales, and want to pass the recipe for mom, so she can make some for Christmas for me................hehehe!
Beef Brisket Tacos http://muybuenocookbook.wordpress.com/2011/01/15/beef-brisket-tacos/
Yummy!! My favorite flans that made the taste cut were: Kahlua and Rum, Pumpkin for sure, Almond with/Amaretto liquer, Orange Zest. Veronica
Here's Ellie Kay appearing on ABC News Now with tips on ways to save money in 2011.
Today's Ellie Kay tip: Shop around and save. Compare prices before you buy especially for things like car insurance. Many drivers who shop and switch car insurance companies can save hundreds of dollars. Compare rates at progressive.com or with a local insurance agent.
We're working with finance expert Ellie Kay to give you new ways to save money in the New Year. This week, we're sharing money-saving tips from Ellie every day. Today's tip: People tend to spend more during vacations because they dont plan ahead. FuelEconomy.gov can help you set a budget before you leave by estimating the cost of gas. Dont forget to figure in meals and incidentals, too. 
Ten tips to help you stay in control behind the wheel
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: A brief 'paws' for winter walking tips
It's an issue that divides the nation - it's Dress Your Pet Day! Where do you stand on dressing your pet? Anyone have funny pictures they want to share?
Got into an accident last week and still have not heard back from an insurance adjuster. is this normal to take this long for a full coverage customer? A rental car is not solving the problem.
Nice progressive , Thanks for removing my post! We can't have people actually voicing their opinions on here! We don't want people to see the bad juju you pull!
VERY VERY Dissatisfied with the whole customer service! Filed our first claim after my husband was in an accident last night and since it was after office hours we didn't hear from an agent until today who won't even get us a rental car until we have our jeep moved from the body shop where it is waiting to be fixed so that some adjuster can determine it if is a total loss. The mechanics have already said there is no way its totaled and why can't an adjuster come to the shop. Why do we have to have it towed somewhere else and then towed back??? Sounds like wasted time and money! oh and we have left 4 messages with this agent and she has yet to call back! She even leaves a name and number of someone who can help right away and guess what, goes to their voice mail and they haven't even called back. We just want our vehicle taken care of and for someone to actually talk to us and answer our questions without the run around PLEASE
Hi Progressive: :) I'm wondering if it is possible for a tourist to buy an auto insuarance while in the US ? My girlfriend and I are planning a 3 month road trip (we are buying our own car), and we find it very tricky to figure out the whole car insurance matter. Please help us out. Thanks !
Our secure online customer service site lets you keep track of your claim at any time. Whether you have a Progressive policy or not, you can report and monitor your claim online 24/7.
I just wanna say Progressive Rocks! I was recently in an accident that totalled my car, progressive had me in a rental that same day! Then my car was evaluated and they issued me a check for the value of the car, and my carseats not even a week after the accident! They handled everything promptly and got me what I knew my car was worth! I love you progressive!
Wow, what Progressive Insurance agent are you using to have such problems. I got my policy online and haven't ever had any trouble out of customer service. I had one accident and everything was done in a timely manner including the adjuster checking on my car everyday and calling me with a status update. I would just like to say thanks Progressive for being there when I needed you most!! 
Dear progressive, I had no intention of dropping my policy with you until a west virginia customer service consultant was very unhelpful and told me I was "being unreasonable with my expectations of an insurance company" when I needed options after totalling my car. My hard earned dollars can find a company that will listen to me and help me.
Just thjnking, if Flo wore a big white Snuggie with PROGRESSIVE big blue letters across the front (like their IRVs), they would sell like hot-cakes!!!!!! Just say'in!!!
I just cant believe it but i just switched and im saving 100.00 a month! Thank u! Now i dont have to b pissed when i pay my insurance! Wooooo hoooooo!
I only liked this page to tell you guys are losing a customer, due to the effect from my daughter flipping her car, and being treated non accordingly. I do not like the way you are handling our claim. And I am saying this in the nicest way I personally know how to. And from word of mouth and who I am, you will be loosing a few more customers, I am so dissatisfied with progressive. My daughter flipped her car, dodging a deer. My Daughter!! not only was it the scariest thing I have ever went through but making it worse was progressive hasnt been any help what so ever. Progressive customer for years. 
Hey, just wanted to let yinz know, I had Progressive for a year before switching to Esurance because they were cheaper when I bought a new car. After five years and two more cars later, I'm back. Not only are yinz cheaper (I'm saving 60% by switching back), but I have a LOT more coverage. Glad to be back!
whoever Donna is that works in the quote department is AMAZING!!!!!!! i was going to change insurance companies but because of her dedication to help me get whats best for me and how nice and just amazing she was i will saty with progressive..........BUT ONLY BECAUSE OF HER!!!!!!!!!!!! ANFD FLO YOU ARE AWESOME TOO
Thank you Progressive for your awesome claims support and great customer service through out my wifes accident. You were truly amazing for us through it all. And because of our years of service from you we aren't getting charged for the accident. Thank you!
Lets test your nutrition knowledge! Guess how many calories are on this plate: roasted turkey breast, fresh vegetable stuffing and fresh steamed vegetables.
I PURCHASED A TURKEY SANDWICH AND TORTILLA SOUP ON FRIDAY FOR LUNCH... ATE SANDWICH AND PUT SOUP IN REFRIDGERATOR....FORGOT ABOUT IT... JUST HAD THE SOUP FOR SUNDAY BREAKFAST-IT WAS GREAT !!! BOSTON MARKET SHOULD BE OPEN FOR BREAKFAST !!!
i miss boston market stroudsburg PA its a shame they closed the store !!! ... what a great job !!!!
you guys are AWESOME! i just ordered AND paid for dinner online... <3 you guys... lol
I love that you changed your gravy. Now it is more like what I make at home!
I was just at the Quakertown, PA Boston Market and there is a guy there named Joe and he's hilarious! Visit him!!
I just want to say how good and healthy R all the side dishes, very good; but I think your employees R overworked, I know this because I visit your stores at least 3 times a week...
You have the Meatless Monday, so how about having a Veg-less Tuesday for all of us carnivores?
Please open a Boston Market in Winston Salem, NC!! There used to be one there but it was closed several years ago. 
Check out Boston Market in Indianapolis! 5 great loations to serve you! Pick your favorite side dish....have some hot, fresh chicken...Let us do the cooking for YOU!! We can cater your office party!
Boston Market lends a hand and some joy, earning a spot in the Purple Goldfish Project at #581. http://www.marketinglagniappe.com/blog/2010/12/14/boston-market-lends-a-hand-and-some-joy/
Snow in AL, LA, MS and moving north? It sounds like we could all use a little winter warm up. Soups on at Boston Market! Stop by for a warm cup of Chicken Noodle, Broccoli Cheese or Chicken Tortilla soup.

why is there no longer frozen boston market dinners, especially the mac n' cheese, at the grocrery market!?! bring it back for 2011 and there after 
I love your food, but you guys really should think of others. I had the worst time ever going through the interview process in Tucson. They told me I had a job so I quit mine. Than they told me never mind. A few weeks later they call me back twice, two different people for two more different interviews, they get all confused about it and than nether one of them give me a job. That is just mean I am a fulltime studant and father of five and a six month prego wife that was just mean.. It would be one thing if i was not good enough but the guy said I tested high on thier test and the other manager called me back twice and his asstants hired me on the spot!!! Till he let me go.
I don't like the new changes. I go to Boston Market so I can get good food and not have people bring my food out, refill my drink etc. at good prices. With adding the silverware, plates, and people bringing your food out to your table for us you are raising the overhead. It costs money to #1 purchase the flatware #2 have additional people on the line to wash the dishes and bring out customer's food and drinks #3 there are kids out there who think it is funny to steal stuff from restaurants, bye bye plates and hello additional costs to replace them. I now have experienced, with the new plates, my pot pie trying to fly off my plate and onto the floor. When I asked to just have the tray and not the plate I thought the server's head was going to pop off. "Please no plate, just the pot pie on the tray." I don't want the prices of the food to go up due to overhead. It seems like an unnecessary additional expense, your food is already great you don't need all this other stuff.
Just had lunch at BM in South Daytona. Same great food... Lousy new system. Please change it back. Our demographic (60+) love home cooking, but will resist change, sorting silverware, and dirtydishes.
Keep the pot pies in stock after 6pm! The tortilla soup add on side for a buck is a super great value and very tasty!
Childhood memories with you guys! My mom used to take me all the time to the one in Salem, Oregon, 15 years ago and I loved your cornbread and mac 'n cheese before you closed it up. I'm visiting Delaware now and your Christiana location brings back such fond memories(plus I've acquired a taste for the stuffing and chicken which are AMAZING). I'm sad you don't have any locations in Oregon(that I'm aware of) but it makes the rare visits when I can even better. :D <3
Just had the Frozen Roast Pot Roast; excellent! Just in time, we have snow, and I made sure to have a half decent meal before battling the elements. Turns out the Frozen Roast Pot Roast; was more than that. 
Ahhh Boston Market! You changed your food!!! You gravy does not taste the same and you screwed up your beans by putting almonds and Red peppers in them!!! NO longer a fan! Will not eat there again, and that is sad cause I loved to eat there!!!
 introduces Crispy Country Chicken menu items.. Please bring it back! 
Absolutely love your chicken , mashed potatoes and Mac & Cheese . Any suggestions on what I should try next ???
OMG, the SQUASH CASSEROLE was THE BOMB!!! WE WANT IT BACK PLEASE!!! :) :)
I am a tried and true customer of Boston Market and have had two events catered by you. However, I had not been there in awhile. Went last night and was thrilled to see a few new side dishes. Is it my imagination but aren't the side dishes much larger quantities? And I don't remember having real plates! But I noticed that the 3 piece chicken portion was very very skimpy. Are you serving larger sides but smaller entree portions?
To me, the sides served were small, and when I asked the server to give more mac and cheese, she replied, "I can only put in one spoon". Also, my food was cold and I spent almost $10 for the meal and a drink. If this is the new BM I'm not liking it. Btw-it was the Boca Raton store on Glades and 441. Never again!!!
Just ate the Brisket with some sweet potatoes........omg good food ....my favorite....love you guys........
my daughter is 5 years old and will only eat your mac and cheese how can i get more coupons??
I have to admit that the new proceedure where they bring the food for you to the table instead of you waiting, is a very nice touch. Service is always excellent. A+++++++++ for the Boston Market on Amherst street in Nashua, NH. 
Boston Market, I love your food at a very compettitive price!
just had my one year :) lmao
One of my favorite sides are: Loaded potatoes (your regular mash potatoes with cheddar cheese and bacon), Mixed veggies, buttered spinach, candied yams, 
Went through the drive-thru of your Crofton, MD location this evening to pick up dinner for the family and was told they were out of chicken ... AGAIN. It's a common problem at this location. It's prime dinner time, 7PM and they are telling people it's a 30 minute wait for chicken. Crazy!! Isn't chicken what you guys became famous with??? I know it's always what I've gone there for. VERY irritating! Ended up going to Popeyes down the street, so I hope they are happy with the customer service they are providing to send paying customers right back out the door empty handed.
I LOVE BOSTOM MARKET AND MY CO-WORKERS.....Julia, Dakota, Adam and Nicki <3 TEAM WORK! THAT'S WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT!!!!

Ciao a tutti, e piacere di conoscervi! Sono vegetariana da anni ormai, e molto intenzionata a diventare vegana, per pura questione etica. Come credo la maggior parte dei vegetariani...Per, non vivendo da sola, ho dovuto trovare un compromesso. Continuare a mangiare formaggi, ma avvicinandomi alla natura. In pratica vorrei trovare formaggi fatti da animali che pascolano sereni negli alpeggi, seguendo il loro naturale percorso esistenziale, e non rinchiusi in una stalla di citt...Mi indirizzate perfavore? Io sono di Torino Grazie!

Great video by Richard Blais, but for food safety reasons we've never felt very comfortable with sous vide cooking ground meats. What's your opinion?
Our friend, Seattle Food Geek, tried to use the Sous Vide Professional to temper chocolate. We're curious, has anyone else tried this? What were your results?
We've got chocolate on our minds...

I took a break from the PFM for a few years. I'm glad to see you've progressed and apparently become more farmer and community friendly! And also glad to see that you are offering something wonderful for kids = cooking! I am a culinary instructor and presented to the PFM board in 2007 the possibility of teaching cooking classes for kids at the PSU market and was told in no-uncertain terms that my idea was ridiculous and not something the PFM would ever include. I see also that the person in authority who told me such, is no longer with you. :-) Kudos for moving onward & upward to a better market!

This Saturday we're keeping our Asian noodle salad with mind-blowing peanut sauce and the beans with pan-Asian coconut sauce. Crowd pleasers, they are.
Our chickpea-quinoa salad with apricots and toasted almonds is making a comeback tomorrow! Also, we're quite excited for our boozy chili with seitan chorizo and lime sour cream.
This Saturday's menu is a doozy. 1. Eggplant rollatini with cashew ricotta and marinara sauce, served on a bed of creamy polenta 2. A Turkish-inspired chickpea-quinoa salad with apricots and almonds 3. Breakfast of champions - sausage, tofu scramble, and garlic brown rice. Don't miss it!
Tentative menu for this Saturday: the usual Pinoy breakfast (sausage and scramble), tofu noodle salad with mind-blowing peanut sauce, white beans in a spiced pan-Asian coconut sauce (currently a favorite of my family of omnivores). Come one, come all!
If you didn't catch our Asian noodle salad last week you might as well pop by Mercato C today and get a hold of it. Same goes for our beans in pan-Asian coconut sauce and our classic Pinoy breakfast. Come one, come all! Now, off to bed to catch some 2 1/2 hour shut-eye.
We are toying with the idea of having eggplant rollatini with cashew ricotta and marinara sauce on the menu this Saturday (soy free, gluten free). Also, a Turkish-inspired chickpea-couscous (or quinoa) salad with dried apricots and almonds. What do you say, yay or nay? We're keeping the Pinoy breakfast on as usual.
We can't break our love affair with our Turkish-inspired chickpea-quinoa salad, so that's still on the menu this Saturday. Same goes for our breakfast of champions of sausage and scramble. Our special for this Saturday is drunken chili con chorizo -- yummy kidney beans stewed in tomatoes, beer, and tequila with a healthy dose of cilantro. We're... serving this with our popular lime sour cream. Woohoo!
Last Saturday's Asian noodle salad with mind-blowing peanut sauce, tofu, and vegetables. We're bringing it back for this Saturday's market!
hey! tried your pinoy breakfast today and i enjoyed it. :) i suuuper loved the way you cooked the rice too! whenever we cook brown rice at home, it's always super dry. is there a way to make it as moist as yours or is it in the rice's brand? :) will try the asian noodle salad next time. it sounds good!
Today's drunken chili con chorizo was a hit! We're serving this again next Saturday :) PS This was lovingly cooked for a total of 3 hours. We take chili making seriously.
Join us for a unique event where we'll watch nationally known speakers sharing "big ideas" about changing the way we eat, live from Manhattan.

Hello from a fan in America! Hope all is well with you guys! Long story but figured Id share it! I took my first trip abroad to Athens this past May to visit the home of my ancestors (I was there during the first riots). While there I stayed at the Athens Gate Hotel, and met the morning breakfast cook (who sadly his name escapes me, but his brother is a member of the band) and we got to know each other over the course of the 8 days I was there. He gave me two of your CD's, 'Shades of Insanity' and 'When Purity Withers', needless to say I play your stuff just about everyday on my iPod! You guys rock! \m/ I was hoping that someone could get back to me on what the breakfast cooks name is? Id like to add him on FB and keep up with him for when I come back to Athens in the future. Keep rocking guys and the next time Im in Greece I hope to get more of your CD's!

I wanted to find out where I could find Bueno Chile Rub. I LOVE it...I put it on meat, in casseroles, and veggies. I can only seem to find it at stores at special kiosks, so i usually buy four at a time. Thanks, Bueno! 
Did you know that ounce for ounce, green chile has more vitamin C than citrus fruits? Have a bowl of green chile stew tonight to fight off any cold germs! See the recipe below.
Congratulations to Linda B. from IL, Virginia G. from OH, Petchy S. from NM, Jane N. from IN, Jacque C. from TX, Pat G. from VA, and Kayla B. from TN for winning our free cookbook Harvesting Our Heritage: Healthy Cooking & Eating for Life.

Did you know that eating chile peppers burns calories by boosting the metabolism? In fact, Weight Watchers has included chile peppers in their list of "eight super foods your body will thank you for eating." Here's to a healthy new year!
Did you know that the chile pepper is a nutrient dense food that contains naturally occurring calcium, iron, vitamins such as A, B2, B6, C, niacin and folate, minerals such as phosphorus and potassium and essential amino acids such as tryptophan, lysine, and phenylaine. Here's to a hot and healthy new year!
Did you know that eating chile peppers makes you feel good in the same way that exercise gives you a high: Getting your "chile fix" is not just hype; there's science behind the claim--chile has endorphin-boosting properties.
This chicken adobada recipe is a low fat take on a traditional favorite. Easy to make and nutritious too!
Congratulations to Pat G. from Virginia and Kayla B. from Tennessee. Your free Harvesting Our Heritage cookbooks are on their way! We have 8 more free ones to give until 8 pm MST tonight! Enjoy!

My son and I just finished eating the Hamburger Steak with onion gravy. It was an easy dish to prepare and WOW the taste was delicious! Thanks for the recipe. I'm glad I found the site!
I just found your blog while looking for a recipe for southern tea..Love It!! Southern cooks are the best.
I just read your about page, and let me say... what is the point of eating and cooking if all you are going to do is substitute something really yummy for something that is kind of yummy to save a few calories. Ain't happenin' over here and I am glad to see someone else that isn't afraid of the big sugarfree-lowcal-nocholesterol-organiccrazy-paranoid world we live in ;) 
Have a great weekend, Mary. Going to snow out my way so I better get some soup made soon. Lol
Mary, what do you think is your best ground beef casserole dish. I need a really good one. Thanks in advance! Luv ya!
I made the Apple Cobbler, today, with my three year old granddaughter, Mollie. It is delicious! Starting her off early... I want her to have the same love for cooking as her Nana. Thanks!
Chicken Chili crock pot recipe (very easy, & healthy): 4-5(depending on size) boneless chicken breast halves; 1 16 oz jar of salsa (i prefer one w/ black beans); 2 tsp garlic powder; 1 tsp ground cumin; 1 tsp chili powder; for ex heat add 1/2 tsp of ground cayanne pepper; salt & pepper to taste; 1 small can Mexican style corn; & 1 small can kidney beans (optional, I only use this if I don't have the salsa w/ black beans)
Thinking about gravy and biscuits this morning. It is 12 degrees here and I have decided if you can sop it, smother it, or fry it... then it is a Deep South Dish. Breakfast anyone?
Mary, just had to tell you about the miracle that occurred last night! I finally got the rice right! I've been married for almost seven years now to a born and raised NOLA boy. (Only being active duty in the Marine Corps keeps him away from home.) Anyway, I have mastered his grandma's jamalaya, and just about all of his other favorite dishes, but for the life of me I can never get the rice to come out right. (We have Stansel popcorn rice shipped to us.) It always came out in a big pile of stuck together glue...even after trying to follow his grandmother's directions... Anyhow, last night I followed your directions for perfect hot cooked rice, and it was....PERFECT! I couldn't believe it and my husband about cried! Thank you so much--just made my day to have perfect, fluffy rice!!! 
Can I *borrow* that quote on your homepage about the Banana Pudding???? LOL!!!!
I love scallops and I am the only one that eats them. Red Lobster has great ones, can anyone help me with a scallop appetizer recipe? Thanks.
Looking forward to that French Onion Soup recipe you mentioned in your last post. I was about to make some tomorrow. Now I'll wait for your recipe! :D
What website would i find the recipe for southern pecan pie? thanks so much!
I just found this site today looking for a hoecake recipe ... how wonderful that you have the treasured recicpes us Southern gals grew up on!
I have a question for you. I want to start my own blog about the different recipes I find. If I am trying one of your recipes what would I need to do to post it to my site? Just post your link with it or what? Thanks in advance! You can message me or just comment whatever is easier
Love your website...I was wondering if u have a recipe for blueberry turnovers? My Grandma used to make them, but I have no clue how to even start. Thank You 
I must admit...my favorite way to make blueberry turnovers is with frozen puff pastry. I cook blueberries that I picked during the summer and froze with a bit of sugar, water and cornstarch and vanilla flavoring...super easy. Now if any of you make your own puff pastry? well, I am just not that good yet!
Do you know of any cook ahead meals that freeze well. I usually am rushed when I get off work, would love just to cook ahead some meals and pull them out during the week
You had a recipe for oven fried chicken, i cant find it!!!! Help!!!
Help with herbs. I really dont care for rosemary. To me it taste like pine needles (must have chewed on one to many as a kid.) What can I replace rosemary with? I like mild tasting and dislike any that taste like pine or wood. 
I'm from N.MS, when I was growning up my grandmother used to make a Raisin Custard pie, it was like a Egg Custard pie w/ raisins. OMG, it was so good, I've been to every recipe page there is. The ones I find call for brown sugar, I'm looking for one that don't. 
Hello Moma Mary...just had to pop in and get some supper Ideas....I love and miss you! Hope your keeping warm! 
Does anyone have a French Onion Soup recipe that is as good as Panera Bread's?
I made this recipe this past week... Shrimp and Fettuccine and it was really good.
Made your hamburger sliders today. . what a great concept. My husband loved them!!
Mary, you look so familiar to me... I wonder if I've met you. I grew up in Biloxi and now live in the neighboring city. It's funny, I came across your website Deepsouthdish by accident and just realized you're from around the corner.
Just found your site and am so excited to try out some of these recipes with my family. We love to spend time together in the kitchen! What a wondeful site, looking forward to future post!! Have a blessed week!
last night u were talking about the 3 pot crock pot and i really want one. I wanted to share what my husband bought at Walmart for deer camp, but it never made it. Today when i needed another large pot to boil pasta, I pulled this out, it had never been used, it is an 8 quart multi-cooker, stainless steel, has 8 qt. base, 6 qt. pasta insert with handles, which was great, i boiled the pasta with the strainer in it and just lifted it out, and also a smaller steamer with handle and a glass lid, really neat, made by Tramontina. I think it's found a permanent home. HA!!
Love Mike Anderson's Seafood (etoufee), Loretta's pralines in the French Market, gotta have beignets at Cafe DuMonde, Mr. B's Bistro, ride the streetcar and have a snack or freakfast at Magnolia Grill, or breakfast at Mother's....I gain 10 pounds saying "N'awlins"

Good morning! Hope your new year has started off well. I know that many of you are going to be dieting, or at least cutting back on things, like sugar, carbs, and fat.

Hope y'all have been having a great weekend & have a great start to a new week. It's just starting to rain and get much colder here but looks like some of you could even have a snow day tomorrow!

Good Morning and BRRRRR! Wishing you a beautiful day. "Being happy doesn't mean everything is perfect. It means you have decided to look beyond the imperfections." ~Unknown
This is a wonderful sight. For those of you who know our Twin Timbers neighbor Kim Ray, you know she has Pancreatic Cancer and is going through a lot of different treatments etc. Everyone has been doing their best to help them by bringing food etc. Well this site has enabled us to sign up for certain days that she and her family are home to eat. Wonderful. Cheryl T. thanks for including me in with this info.
I just had a baby a week ago and one of my friends used this to coordinate with the different groups of friends we have together to allow them the choice to bring us a meal. It is very simple to navigate (from my point of view she set it up so not sure about that part) and blessing to me! 
My best friend was in a horrible accident last weekend, she was released from the hospital today & another friend coordinated meals for our friend & her father, who is battling cancer as well. Its a wonderful idea!! 
This site is brilliant and I use it all the for time coordinating meals for friends with new babies in my MOPS and MOMS Club groups, friends who had surgery, etc... It has made my job coordinating everyone so easy -- and it makes such a difference to those who receive the meals -- thank you! 
I think it is amazing that someone named "Adina" came up with this!! I love this program and just used it to organize meals for my brother-in-law's family after some complications from a recent surgery he had from injuries in Iraq. I feel so helpless so far away from them (we are in Kentucky, they are in California) but I am able to help them from a distance by coordinating meals! I love checking in and seeing the meals being provided. Thank you!!!
Hi, is there any way that you can "share" your meal plan with Facebook friends other then just posting a link?
New here but just to say, Kudos to those who came up with this idea! This is Awesome!
thanks for creating this tool.... the pastor's wife just used it to organize meals for someone sick and it is great... love it. love it. Blessings to you.
Never heard of this site before someone made a schedule for me! Thank you for creating this brilliant tool!! God Bless!!
Feels good to help others in need.
Thanks to Alexis Spallone for submitting her recipe for Orecchiette with Broccoli Raab. I tried out the recipe on my own family and it was delicious. The anchovies made me hesitant, but I'm glad I trusted Alexis. This is a great recipe! If you have a favorite recipe you'd like to send for possible inclusion on our site, feel free to e-mail it to us.
Another great idea from a meal coordinator: Create a snack schedule for a friend who is going through chemo. Arrange to have the snacks delivered to her house the days before her treatments. Make sure to include an encouraging note or something to make her smile.
I LOVE this site - and I'll be telling everyone I know about it. Thank you!!!
what a brilliant idea

My daughter adores Horizon; we started drinking it when she started solids. I am never going back. We love Horizon, especially since Horizon not only is organic and hormone free, but its farmers also treat its livestock well.
Quick, in one word describe the taste of Horizon organic milk!
this is like the only milk i fricken drink!
Last summer my dietcian advised me to switch to organic, hormone-free milk. Horizon fat free milk is all I drink now.
My three year old absolutely loves your chocolate milk boxes. He's been a faithful milk & honey ( to help with his allergies) drinker every morning for two years. He used to wake up each morning asking for milk & honey but now I hear "want chocolate milk, Mama?". : ) Thanks for making a quality product I can feel good about giving to my son since every chocolate syrup, powder, mix, etc. sold in supermarkets are full of harmful ingredients.
Drinking Horizon for the first time and I was astounded at the taste, it is just like what I drank as a kid. Clean smell and taste. Will not go back to the "other" milk. I love it!
OMGosh.....Horizon has these "milk" boxes it is 2.99 for a 3 pack. I am addicted to the vanilla and could easily drink 5 in a day. I've had 3 today. Horizon, I always have your regular milk in my fridge, and cannot ever drink regular milk again. Do you offer coupons for the milk boxes, or do you sell them at Costco or Sam's? 
In the past 3+ years of drinking Horizon Organic milk, I have never been so upset with your company. I must say, today I feel let down by your company :(
Thanks for sorting everything out! Feel GREAT about taking the time to listen :)
My 2 yr old daughter loves your milk. We give her the whole milk and also the little cartons of regular and vanilla milk, she calls them her milkshakes. They are def. a special treat for her, thanks for a great product!
Dear Horizon, please make ice cream because your vanilla milk would taste perfect as that or even the carton size of vanilla would be splendid, thanks.
My husband, me, and our son(18 months old) love your 2 percent and whole milk. Keep up the good job!
Where can we find gallons of white milk and how much does it cost? We are in mass.
Have you ever thought of making half-gallons of the vanilla or strawberry milk? For the past 4-5 years, have been buying the 3-packs or cases of the invidual sizes and Horizon is the ONLY milk we buy (and we buy a lot of it!). We'd love to see them in more economical packaging. We have seen the chocolate, but not the vanilla or strawberry. Thanks!
Love Horizon Milk products. I buy the 2% and it taste better than the regular whole milk products!
hi horizon i love your chocalate,vanilla and strawberry 8 oz milks im a adict!!!!!!!!!their sooo GOOD!!!!!!!
i LOVE your chocolate milk (in the little boxes) and the extending straws are pretty rockin. :D
Our daughter LOVES Horizon milk, and as a mom, I have piece of mind giving her Organic whole milk that I trust, and that my husband and I love as well! Keep up the good work!!
Bought Horizon's half gallon of choc. milk yesterday on a whim (I usually make it myself) and it has made the MOST delicious hot chocolate today! we are all enjoying a snow shoveling break with this right now!!
i loooove horizon milk! the regular's great but the chocolate is something else. easily the best chocolate milk ever! =)
We love your products. Any chance you will have a coupon for your cheese? My kids live off your American cheese slices & cheese sticks.
I started drinking your milk about 1 year ago. My cousin has children 4 & 7 and they drink you milk. I have never been a milk drinker and both of my children stopped drinking milk at 9 & 10 months to my dismay. If your milk was around then, they would have never stopped drinking it. It is so creamy and good, i find myself looking for a cold glass each day. When i bought the first half gallon home, my son was 19 then said why are you wasting you money on organic milk it all taste the same. So i told him to taste it and needless to say he finished the half gallon that day. Now i only buy you milk and when he is home from college i have to by extra because he will drink almost 2 containers in the weekend. Like i said, I wish it was around when he was a baby. 
We love your products at our house and I heat the chocolate milk for for hot chocolate. At least that way I know what's in it.
I <3 Horizon! Enjoying my 1% organic chocolate milk right now!
Is it weird that I married a man who has the same stomach issues (lacetose intolerant) as myself!? lol.. but i'm so glad we finally found a milk that doesn't make us sick. We <3 horizon a ton!
This Chocolate Milk is the BEST! My children love it and so do I!
I remember the delicious milk when I was a little (in 1950's) and over the years milk has changed...then 5 years ago after researched for eating due to my health and drank Horizon whole organic milk that shocked me how delicious it was, brought a lot of memories when I was little with the milk. 
Just wondering why.....when I scan the QR code on the coupons I printed from your site, it takes me to SmartSource and says the coupon is Not Valid. It does this for all of them.
I really love you small milks to go... my son loves the vanilla milk the best.... they were 10 for 10$ at Fred Meyer recently.. stocked up.... Please dont stop making them :o)
I got sick every time I had Milk, and one time my husband came home with Horizon and now is the only product we use, do you have Icream as well? that would be wonderful!! Please make some, or if you do tell me where to find it I would LOVE to be able to eat organic icream!!!
I started buying Horizon Organic Milk because I noticed that the shelf life was longer than that of nonorganic brands. When I tasted it, I was hooked. It tastes so much better than the other milk on the shelves and I won't buy anything else. I don't care that it's a little more expensive, quality is what I look for and my kids are healthier for it too.
Best.Milk.Ever!
I am hooked with the chocolate milk, best flavor... and the white milk has gave the chance to my body to accept milk again! my family and I go by quality and here it is HORIZON! thanks guys for a great product
definitely the only milk i can process and it reminds me of what milk SHOULD taste like!
Most of my life I thought I just didn't like milk. Then I tasted Horizon. It doesn't have the aftertaste that I had hated all my life. Now I LOVE milk!
the best tasting milk ever! My son goes gaga over it (with DHA Omega-3)...never thought that its 2% reduced fat will taste just as creamy and am thrilled to be getting my daily intake! Love it :)
'EAT FOODS WITH INGREDIENTS YOU CAN PRONOUNCE DAY' READ THE LABEL and free yourself from additives and preservatives... Just say NO to High Fructose Corn Syrup, Aspartame, MSG, Nitrates, Sulfites, Benzoate, artificial coloring and many others...on APRIL 22 (also Earth Day) Please repost to start spreading the word... HELP TAKE BACK OUR FOOD !
Never tried it, but definitely willing too. My son drinks milk like crazy and i don't think it is all that good for him. I should try organic.
Sniffle, I'm lactose-intolerant, yet I buy the big packs of your chocolate milk all the time. Totally worth it, though, it's my favorite milk. :3
My kids are watching the Disney Channel and we just saw your ad for milk with the Grandpa and Granddaughter playing chess. They were very excited to see it, especially my son who is in the chess club at school. After the ad was over he said "that is why I always beat Dad in chess because I drink Horizon." It was awesome:-)
My daughter wasnt much of a milk fan but once she tried Horizon chocolate milk... she loves it... she calls it Chocolate Cow... (LOL)... I'm so happy with your product.. Thank You...
We potty-trained both of our daughters by bribing them with Horizon Chocolate milk each morning that they woke up dry! Fastest potty training on earth! Thank you for such terrific products (the Strawberry Tube Yogurt is my favorite!).
Did you change your chocolate milk lowfat one? the calories are less and the taste as well :(
My 3 year old will only let me buy the "cow" milk! We love it and I feel great about buying it for her. : ) (now if only there was a less sweet version of your strawberry milk)
we love Horizon DHA milk! We have purchased the 2% and Vit D for about 4.5 years, awesome milk! I never liked fat free milk until I tried Horizon, just as creamy and delish as the vit D and 2%! Thanks for adding DHA to the fat free milk.
Cheesy question of the day. What's you favorite way to make macaroni and cheese? Post a recipe link or just tell us about it.
Love all the products! I have gotten other family members using the products! Just wish we could get milk by the gallon in our area.
I love the taste and the nutrition facts of Horizon organic 2% milk. It is also easy for my 6 year old son to handle it at school lunch time. I wish Costco carries this product where I can purchase in quantity.
Yummmm...my kids love the chocolate singles!
We all LOVE your milk! I was curious why it lasts so much longer (expiration dates) than the store branded non organic variety. We are now customers for life!
we religiously by your milk, we go through a gallon a week and every morning, and after his naps, my (almost) 2 year old runs down the stairs yelling "MUK" (his word for milk). thanks for making such a great product!
I have a 13 month old baby that loves your milk!
my baby started on your milk when he came off formula and he loves it. I use it as well because I don't get headaches with it like regular milk. I absolutley love that the expire date last longer than 5-7 days
We can't find horizon 2% in the gallon size....is there such a thing? We only find whole and fat-free.....
i love your milk. i cant stand to drink milk but i tried this and i can drink. thank you for the great tasting milk
As much as I hate spending almost $4 for half a gallon of milk, I will never buy anything but organic milk again. I have to buy 2% for my boy and fat free for hubby and me.
Love the chocolate milk! It's such a treat!
Love the Strawberry Milk! Wish I could get it in Large Containers!!!
My daughter had tummy aches real bad with milk.A lady in the store recommended your Organic milk.We made the switch and carefully monitored her.All your flavors passed the test.The pediatrician said its because your milk is processed differ. Is that true?
We just switched our son from Formula to your Organic whole milk with DHA Omega-3. He loves it and his belly has tolerated it perfectly!! Thanks
This is the only milk I found that my son can drink but I have to buy this milk in lactose free which is really hard to find I can only find it at this one Krogers
I wish every school lunch program would include Horizon instead of that "white colored water" they serve. (My son's description of milk other than Horizon)
Your chocolate milk is a treat at my house!! We could drink the entire carton in one day!!!
love the chocolate milk!
Having a son with ADHD I monitor his intake of processed foods and sugars carefully. Keep up the great work providing our kids with great whole foods like I was able to enjoy as a child growing up on a dairy farm.
Your Chocolate Milk is the BEST
my son loves your strawberry but I need more coupons
Chocolate Milk Is Gold With Our Family
great milk!!!
I love your milk. Even fat free tastes good. It's healthy too!
I just love your chocolate milk! I always get the individual ones @ Costco. Just bought some this past weekend though and it tastes different. Almost watered down. Noticed the packageing was different. Has something changed???
Thrilled to see the DHA in Fat Free!!!!
we all love this milk..glad to see it fat free! Thanks Horizon
Both of my kids love the Horizon milk and I like that it's organic and has DHA in it!
this milk is so Goooooooood.....
We buy Horizon chocolate milk by the case!
Can you recycle the bag that the shredded cheese comes in? I can't find the recyclable icon on it anywhere. 
We love Horizon milk and don't buy any other kind!
Great sweepstakes to go along with great products! Love the Horizon Half and HALF FOR MY COFFEE!!
Love the Horizon Organic Chocolate Milk after my workout !
Love this milk!
My child takes Horizon milk to school in his lunch box every day. He got hooked on Horizon when we would go to Starbucks. We would get out coffee and he would get a Horizon Vanilla milk. I look for it at every grocery store I go to ... looking for a sale on the 3 packs. :) 
yet another crazy snow day in the Northeast, and my family is loving the hot choc. made from Horizon choc. milk...thanks for such a great product!!
This family decided to have an organic milk taste test. We have found a few organic milks (generic) that are just a little cheaper. Honestly, we were trying to sway our kids into the cheaper milk (shame). The kids picked your milk EVERY time! . Your milk taste so much better and it SO worth a few extra cents. Thank you for keeping my children happy and we are now devoted customers. Thanks!
Horizon Organic Milk Rocks :)
My two boys (4 yo and under) love your milk!!! I should get stock in the company for how many 1/2 gallon DHA Omega-3
We love horizon! I started buying the DHA Omega-3 whole milk for my son, and now we are buying the fat free milk for my husband and I. I am pretty excited about the new fat free DHA Omega-3 milk! Thanks for making such wonderful products!
GREAT MILK
My youngest daughter said at breakfast,"Good milk, Mommy." 
LOVE the idea of the DHA-Omega 3 milk but has anyone ever tried to add Strawberry Nesquik to it? Wow! Mix it, leave it in the fridge for 6 - 8 hrs or so and next thing you know you have gray milk and it smells and tastes awful! I wonder why? Happens to us everytime! So, since my girls only drink strawberry milk we have to stick with the non-DHA... :(
When I tried Horizon milk for the first time 2 years ago after being referred to try it by a co-worker, I have wanted NO other brand since!!! I am sold!!! :~)
We love Horizon at my house. I wrote an email to the company about purchasing expired horizon single serve milks (and by expired i mean october 2010) and it's been 2 entire weeks and still no response. 
I am totally behind your products, and all organic dairy products, however your grated cheese gets moldy in my fridge before its expiration date all the time. What's up with that? It's happened three times at least. I hope you can get that figured out. I buy your other products as well...it's just that cheese thing...can you fix it please?
Love your products! My son is dairy sensitive, so we buy Almond Milk for them. Would you consider making organic Almond milk? My youngest loves your yogurt!
LOVE your organic milk! Its the best!
My family and I spend $15 dollars a week on Horizon Milk. We need help!!!!
My kids like the chocolate milk boxes.. great for on the go!
We love everything we have tried from Horison but your Chocolate DHA milk gets the most love here!!! I just wish we could buy it in gallons instead of 1/2 gallon! 
the Chocolate is so good 
love your products, especially 2% with dha. Hope you consider making a whole milk version of your individual serving packs. Would love to give them to my baby when she's ready for milk. 
Do you have any goat/sheep's milk products? Would you consider making some in the future? :) We love your stuff, keep up the great work.
Do you still make ice cream and if so, where can I find it.
Stop and Shop is selling expired 18 packs of strawberry milk singles for 5 bucks, is it safe to drink after the expiration date?
I love Horizon String Cheese!
Great cheese & milk!
Great milk our daughter loves it, just hate that it is so difficult to get more than 1 coupon a month for milkbreezers. Anybody have any suggestions? 
What is Horizons position in regard to the GMO alfalfa situation?? What in Horizons opinion does it mean for organic milk as they see it? Very concerned here!! Eagerly await reply. Thanks
can 1 yr old should have organic omega-3 whole milk?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C5F6QG1c-M Trying out Ella's Kitchen Smoothie Fruit
It seems as if Ella's is disappearing from shelves here in Northern California! Every time I go to the store (Target, BRU), there are MAYBE 2 or 3 pouches of the same flavor, and that's it. I truly hope you're not discontinuing sales here!
my baby loved the organic butternut squash, carrot, apple and prunes. I have made it myself so I now have lots of it to keep my baby happy. 
Your stage three pouches are the ONLY pre-prepared food my 1 year old will eat! It's great to always have a pouch handy for when we are out and about. We tried your 'nice rice' the other day too as rice had always been refused.... until now that is!
Hi all at ella's kitchen. i am a marie Curie nurse and i am holding a charity event in july to raise money for marie Curie cancer care. just wondered would you be up for donating a small prize to our kids raffle? wouldn't be offended if u didn't want too. thanks amy x x

b'So essential has aluminum become in applications ranging from electricity transmission, transportation, construction, and packaging of food and medications, that global demand is expected to grow by 12 percent in 2011, following last year\xe2\x80\x99s 13 percent growth.'

Aluminum can also save energy by more effectively managing heat in mobile devices.

NEW TACO BELL INVENTION. Since I love Taco Bell so much, and if you're reading this you probably do too, I thought I would pass this on. Since Taco Bell discontinued the hard taco with a soft taco on the outside with cheese in between. Buy a hard taco. Buy a cheese roll-up. Open up the cheese roll-up so it's a tortilla with cheese on top. Place cheese roll-up under the hard taco, wrapping it upwards over the sides of the hard taco. Enjoy :)
Taco Bell is the BEST!!!!!!!

Wanting to know what the woman in front of me ordered that totaled 42.78 
Dear Taco Bell, Yesterday I went to Taco Bell and I purchased food for my friend and my little brother. I ate nothing myself. Sadness :( Why do you have to list the calories of all your items on the menu? If I didn't know it would be okay for me to eat it. But now that I know, I can no longer partake of the goodness.
Dear, Taco Bell i really think there should be a closer taco bell to me. i can only enjoy the goodness of taco bell if i drive almost an hour away, then go to the mall... that's the ONLY WAY... -_- 
Soft tacos and diet pepsi perfect together....

Black Jack Taco and the Chicken Flatbread Sandwich need to be added to the permanent menu. Enough people ask for them to come back everyday.

Can you tell me what you think the approx. worth of a whole set of Taco Bell talking chihuahuas is worth right now. They are all still in the plastic even.
I just tried the Fresco Style Menu. I love it!!! So good and low in calorie and fills you up! So glad there is a fast food restaurant that I can enjoy and still watch what I eat. 
Taco bell people I am having tacos tonight!!!!
This a comment that will hoefully spread. It's time to bring back the old school taco bell in select cities just like Ford did with the Mustang. If you were not around in the 80's to enjoy the taste that made this company grow you dont know what your are missing. They used to cook the beans fresh in giant pressure cookers in the kitchen, taco sauce came in little tubs, ground beef was fresh, fire pits out in front of stores, menu items like the bell beefer, taco light supreme, beefy tostada, taco bell grande. They could call these select locations taco bell retro or something. people would pay more for the old school way and profit would be huge on these stores.
Taco Bell stills ROCKS BURGER KING'S SOCKS OFF :P- (drooling) Here in Kentucky, United States.
Friday, January 7, 2011 Hey all you Taco Bell Lovers! OK, I admit it, I could probably eat at Taco Bell every day. A few weeks ago I could not decide between a Burrito Supreme and an Enchirito. I wasnt hungry enough for both so I thought of a compromise - the best of both worlds, if you will. I am certain that they employees thought I was nuts - however, to their credit they accommodated me with a smile. I ordered a Burrito Supreme with Enchirito Sauce on top. OMG - it was awesome - except for the part about trying to eat it with two Sporks - I really needed a plastic knife and a Spork (spoon/fork). I think EVERYONE should try it at least once - and if you love it like I do - let Taco Bell know. Im not sure what to call it: perhaps a, Burenchirito Supreme, a Wet Burrito Supreme: Ill stop before I get too graphically creative. You have to try this - it is truly an experience of The Best of Both Worlds in the Land of Taco Bell!
you should try to put a taco bell in my town, across from the highschool, no doubt business for all other places would drop off almost entirely
Bring back the Choco Taco!!!!!!

Whoever runs this page is very smart. You know exactly when to post and you know exactly who your target audiences are. The Fourthmeal is around almost solely for the potheads and/or younger crowd, and you post around eleven or twelve at night, because you know you're going to catch them on here. You catch me every time. Bravo sir (or madam), bravo.
I fucking love Taco Bell.

yo quiero taco bell !!!!!
Dear Taco Bell Representatives, Please introduce an even 'hotter' hot sauce. I drink Fire sauce packets and get barely a tickle upon my tongue. I feel the heat levels of your food reach inferior levels, and being a connoisseur of spicy foods I constantly feel the need for something hotter, and the Fire sauce you provide generously with every order ceases to satisfy this ever-craving palate
Taco bell is awesomely amazing :D
I wish Taco Bell delivered v.v
Soooo sad that there is no Taco Bell in Germany =(
I don't know if your aware but you need a delivery service
Urgeeeeee Un taco Bell En acapulco guerreroo :D

Bring back the Chicken Enchilada Burrito. It was by far and away the most delicious thing on the menu. With the chicken and the cheese all blended together with that amazing enchilada sauce, it was a symphony of delectable delights that played with the senses in ways no man could've ever imagined. Please bring it back.
TACO BELL ROCKS!!

Yo quiero Taco Bell!
TACO BELL GAVE BIRTH TO ME D; <3
I've been seeing a little more variety in the phrases on sauce packets. However, I think Taco Bell should hold a contest where people submit, say, 10 phrases and people can vote on the ones they think should go on the packets.
i just love working at taco bell cuz i can eat all the delicious food whenever i want:)
Ive been getting three of the beefy crunch burritos everday since they came back. I eat there for lunch when im on break i work at whataburger. And my manager hates it when i bring taco bell food to whataburger. Hahahaha

Hello. I've been a regular Taco Bell customer for about 40 years, but now must change to a low-sodium, low-fat diet. I noticed that you have low-fat items on your menu but I can't find any low-sodium food items on your menu. Can you offer or recommend some low-sodium items, in addition to your low-fat items? Thank you and go Taco Bell!!
The Beefy Crunchy Burrito rocks!
GUnne buy that new $5 touchdown taco box later. =] can't ait to taste the tacoy goodness.

How many calories does the 99 cent chicken borrito have?

Okay, so I bought that 5 doller thingy with the burrito and taco and ... idk what that other one was called but I had to share... IT WAS SO GOOD THOUGH!

never understood why Taco bell comes out with amazing items, but then yanks them from the menu :/ Still my favorite, but I'd really like a chicken ranch gordita for 99 cents.
Beefy crunch burrito minus fritos & sour cream and if you realllly need the extra scoop of beef add it for 60cents and you got your cheesey double beef burrito back. :)
Left over broken taco shells to munch on awaiting order 
Love the Beefy Crunch Burrito. Its awesome.
yea even tha beefy crunch burrito is off tha huck
you should deliver on any order over 20 dollars
The super-power would be to deliver delicious food to all those late night munchers
START DELIVERING

You missed it. The Beefy Crunch Burrito should have been named the "Flaming Frito Burrito". COME ON!
i love wrkn at taco bell (:... 144th and maple
FB is boring at the moment and taco bell is 5 mins away yes brb :)
If I ever eat meat again, a gordita supreme is high on the list of foods to eat first
If Taco Bell had a super power it would be to send tacos to people through the taco bell commercials... you just call out the numbers you want and they pop the food through the tv... but hurry because once the TB commercial is done, well.... you have to wait for it to show again... That would be so cool man i would never get from the tv. well i always had this thought in mind. (includes any drink large)
LOVE YOU TACO BELL !!!!!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3 :D
I think taco bell shud deliver me some gordita crunches!!!!
I think Taco Bell should start having a buffet!!!!

cinnamon twists rock
when I had to go vegetarian due to health issues (diabetes, cholesterol, BP, etc) we had a tough time finding places to eat out. Most are hard core meat joints. But we've fallen in love with Taco Bell - Fresco bean burrito, triple layer nachoes, seven layer burritos, plus pretty much anything else, substitute beans and rice for meat. Taco Bell has given us a great place to go out to and eat healthy - and wifi together!
I'm so craving Taco Bell right now, but the closest one to me is an hour away :(
just because i gotta lotta money, does'nt mean i don't like tacos, honey...

BEEFY CRUNCH BURITTO NO RICE ROCKS 
I'm eating taco bell today. I always get a fresco crunchy taco. My first and last bites are usually lackluster because it's mostly just meat. Have you ever tried making a square taco, so every bite gets a little bit of everything?
Volcano Nachos are beast

Taco Bell should be on everyone's dinner table. 
hmm if i get the taco bell symbol tatooed on me do i get free tacos for life? lol
Dear Taco Bell, I can't begin to describe my feelings for you. You've always been there, from sneaking you into a movie with me, to being with me and my friends late night. I just wanna put your beefy crunch burrito in my mouth right now...I adore you and I'll see you soon. <3 Megan

I love you so much Taco Bell. 
mornings like today make me so sad that you don't deliver. PLEASE DELIVER.
What a great employee you have at the Adel Ga. store no. 1857. His name was John. We have never had such good service in any fast food restaurant or even a sit down restaurant. John made sure everything was perfect. He brought our food to our table, collected our trash when we were done and even opened the door for my wife when we left. We really feel like we had been treated like we were in five star restaurant. Thanks John

Is there any way you guys could sell lunch in the morning, because I'll eat taco bell any time. And I'm sure most people would too.
ok never ever ever ever put bacon on the menu again anyone who asks for it you should reach out and punch them in the facehole
Please come to Australia, in particular Adelaide South Australia. My son and I just looked at your menu and it looks stunning.
Thank you Taco Bell for pulling your ads from MTVs new show Skins. As a mother of an awesome teen it is appreciated.
i work at taco bell : ) its amazing lol
I just want to thank you guys for pulling your advertising from the new show. I saw the story on Good Morning America and it's nice to know that some companies still have morals in this country.
Thanks taco bell for dropping your ad on SKINS,,wish I could go buy something from you today ,I am a proud customer!!
You did right pulling your advertising off the MTV "Skins" program! Standing up and protecting our children is always right!
WAY TO GO FOR PULLING UR ADVERTS FROM SKINS!!!!
Yay Taco Bell, and two thumbs way up for pulling your advertising from SKINS :::))))
I applaud your decision to pull ads from Skins - this is an awful example of what we do not want for our your people in this country - Your management should pats yourselves on the back and encourage your associate to boycott this show - shame on MTV - Congrats to Taco Bell - you're responsible and a concerned company and interested in the future of our kids.
Thank you for pulling adds from MTV's Skins. You have earned my respect and my business!
CONGRATS Taco Bell for pulling your ads from Skins! Yes, "real kids" have "real issues" but we need to encourage our kids in a positive way, NOT glamorizing sex, drugs and drinking!
I applaud you for removing your ads from "Skins." I respect your willingness to take a stand and will definitely support Taco Bell with my business!
Thank you for taking a stand and pulling your adds from Skins. I've always loved Taco Bell but will for sure choose your resteraunts over others.. You are an example and encouragement to the American family. THANK YOU
A+ on pulling your ads from the MTV show Skins. 
Bravo, Bravo for pulling the ad, its so refreshing to see a big company take a stand...all the other sponsers should do the same....... LOVE LOVE TAco bell
my stomach's growling.... just thinkin of it
Thank you for removing your support of the absolute garbage show "Skins." I am glad that you realize that advertising on a show promoting teen sex and drug use and broadcasting child-porn was unethical and unwise. I head a family of seven, including two teens, and we will all be having Taco Bell tonight. Well done. 
Thank you for having the decency of pulling your advertise $$$ from "Skins." You show you do care for the families. I will take every chance to tell friends to support Taco Bell. Kudos to you. Angelica Rooker
is impressed with TB for pulling ads from "skins". We must draw a line and this is a good place to start. I head a family of nine and we will continue to patronize TB. Way to go.
I'm was very impressed upon hearing you pulled advertising from "Skins". It's time advertisers stood up for decency. I will support your business and will spread the word whenever I can. 
Thank you for pulling your ads from MTV's Skins. I will support your business and spread the word. :)
Glad to hear you pulled the advertising on Skins. American culture doesn't need any more money thrown at sex sales. 
We have always loved Taco Bell and were so glad to hear you pulled your advertising from the televsion show Skins. Thank you for taking a stand.
I agree 100% with you pulling your advertising from Skins. We talk so much about how our children are our future - well what in the world kind of kids are we going to have maturing into responsible adults if this is what they are being told their lives should look like. Absolutely pathetic and so is a lot of other shows on our TV's - 
Kudos to you Taco Bell for pulling your ads from MTV's Skins.
Beefy crunch burrito rocks!!!
I tried my FIRST Beefy crunch burrito! Great. And THANK YOU for sensitivity in pulling your ad from "Skins". THIS "public" appreciates that decision.
BRING BACK THE CHEESY DOUBLE BEEF BURRITO!!!
Thanks for pulling your ad from Skins I will be headed to Taco Bell to show my support 
WAY TO GO TB for pulling your ads from the demoralizing teen drama, Skins! Not ALL teenagers act the way they are portrayed on that show, but I sure wish more Company CEO's acted like yours and took a stand for morality!!
They really need to come out with a Chicken Box...they got a Beef Box for meat people an a Volcano box for people that like spice why not get a Chicken Fiesta Box going?
beefy crunch burrito = WIN
Does anyone rememeber the Chilito? (spelling?)
I must commend Taco Bell for pulling their Ad from the MTV show Skins! Great move. This is not the type of show I want my kids or anyone's kid watching! Thank you! 
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR PULLING YOUR ADS OFF OF MTV SKINS!!!!! 
Thanks for pulling your ads. 
It was very nice to see that Taco Bell is not going to have commercials on that very bad Skins MTV TV show. I am an old fashion parent who thinks that kids need to be educated the right way and MTV has been blocked from our TV, thanks Taco Bell!
Omg I love taco bell. Even though its always near a trailer park.
Thank you for pulling your commercials from Skins. 
Thanks for pulling your ads on Skins. If you hadn't, I would have driven across the street the McDonald's. Because you pulled your ads on Skins, I will visit my local Taco Bell again, probably tomorrow. Thanks.
Thank you for pulling your commercials from Skins. I really appreciate it!!! Thank you for taking a stand!!!

CUDOS to TACO BELL for doing what is right and pulling support of MTV's 'Skins'. As for me and my house we do not watch trash like that.
Bravo! Thank you, Taco Bell, for doing the right thing and pulling your ads from MTV's 'Skins.' 
Good job, Taco Bell, placing principle ahead of profit! I'm thankful you pulled your sponsorship of "Skins", otherwise my son would have been deprived of his Crunchwrap Supreme - and let's just say he needs his Taco Bell Fix.

Glad to see TB is no longer supporting that huge piece of Crap, Skins, on MTV. I'd sure like to meet the idiots that thought that show was a good idea. Not sure what you guys were thinking initially, but I'm just glad I don't have to give up Meximelts and Crunchwrap Supremes. 
I am so proud of your company for pulling your support of the Skins show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi Taco Bell~ I Think People Would Really Appreciate It If You Delived; You Should Look Into That; <3JessicaDawson.
Thanks for Pulling your sponsorship from that tv show!!!!! We will continue to eat Taco Bell! Crunch wrap supremes rule!!!!
The awkward moment when I mistake a church bell symbol for a taco bell logo..
We went to Taco Bell and we ordered the Beefy Double Cheese Burrito and then the most terrible thing happened--they said that they don't make them anymore! :( That was my absolute favorite thing to eat! Did y'all really take it away??

Sorry you guys are getting sued, but you should advertise what you really put in your meat. Not say that I don't like taco, I do, but it's just that when you say that their is 100% beef in my taco... i expect 100%...... not the 35% that's actually in it ...... Epic fail!
TACO BELL IS BOMBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB....!!..

If the volcano taco was human its mother would be megan fox and its father would be chuck norris. Hot with a little kick (roundhouse kick)
why don't you make a canned taco for older people ? they sell all taco shell's but no canned taco meat already prepared. good way to make a lotttttt of money..
Please bring back the cheesy double beef burrito. It was the best and your new beefy crunch burrito cannot compare. It kinda sucks.

hmmmmm beefy crunch burrito sounds good right now!!
Dear Tacobell, I live in Macomb Illinois... I will be going to the Tacobell in said town in about 15 minutes.. Do you think that there is any way you could call their restaurant and get me a free Crunchwrap Supreme? I have been a dedicated, and (I feel) valued customer over the years, and an act of such kindness on your part would really mean a lot to me. Sincerly, Jeff "Tacobell Fan" Wirsing
The one person that goes to Taco Bell, eats his meal, and leaves without ordering a Mountain dew Baja Blast is a complete and utter moron............Bottom Line....That stuff is heaven.
whole-grain tortillas, please! [at no extra cost!]
hey i love taco bell but there is none near my area. put one in georgina ontario canada if you do i will bow to you over and over
Bring back the black jack taco!!!!
i <3 beefy crunch burrito :D
Second day in a row this week ALONE that I've got tacos with meat (is it really meat?) that tastes/smells like a raw dead...something. Trying to eat them made me feel sick to my stomach. This has happened before. WHY can't your middle management take a da** pay cut in bad economic times instead of forcing rubber foo...
WHY can't your middle management take a da** pay cut in bad economic times instead of forcing rubber food down our throats and making the front-line workers work for peanuts while they weather the complaints that are the direct result of YOUR decisions at corporate.
Yeah, I took some pics the other day of some of these nuclear "tacos"...some didn't even have any cheese in them! Another thing...it is my right to communicate my concerns to you through your web site without sharing my DATE OF BIRTH! You think there is some law that allows you to REQUIRE that of me and kick me back out if I choose not to share it. WOW, Taco Bell is up to some crazy stuff at the corporate level.
Sorry for the long rants, but I don't complain about the prices. I order food and when I pay a premium to "eat out" I expect it to taste decent...I'm not hard to please (evidenced by the fact that I've never posted on your facebook or website before) but when the food tastes like a raw dead animal...I'm sorry...that is wrong.
I LOVE YOU TACO BELL!!!!!!!! <3!
Wow Steve Gray Has No Life Buht To Bag On Taco Bell Wen Everyone Know Itz The Ishh!! Idk Wut Taco Bell Yu Be Goin' To & If Yu Dnt Like It Dnt Go...Problem Solved :)
taco bell is my shit

(:
i love working at taco bell!

Hi Taco Bell. I realy like your 99 burritos. I eat em for breakfast lunch and dinner. THey make me fart alot though. I like taco bell farts because eveytime i fart its like love, i get a big wet kiss.
I am so sick and a cheesy double beef burrito would make me all better, but alas, it is a healing I will not be blessed with since you no longer serve the awesome deliciousness. Boo hoo.
Beefy Crunchy Burrito!!!! YUM!!!!!!

The saucy romance story, courtesy of the sauce packets. "Guess it's just you and me now. I'm single are you? I feel so comfortable in your hands. I'm not just another pretty face. Let me slip out of these wet clothes. I do all my own stunts. Thats my ticklish spot. This is gonna end with you eating me isnt it? Wait I want to remember you like this. Saying goodbye is the hardest part of this job. Promise you'll text me in the morning?"
I Love taco bell 
i love pizza hut and taco bell who came up with putting them 2gether?
If they ever have a Taco Bell category in Jeopardy..........I'll answer every question. "What is the burrito supreme Alex"..........."Correct, moving on....."
Guess I'll have the Chicken Burrito from now on .......... 
Wheres the beef?
after hearing about this 35% beef crap i will never eat at taco bell ever again....thats just wrong
Dear Taco Bell. You are making a tasty mistake by putting 5 dollar boxes on the menu. Now it is the only thing I buy (sometimes a side of fiesta potatoes too.) I used to get something different every time I went to Taco Bell, because I enjoy everything on the menu. But now, the 5 dollar box is the cheapest thing you have on the menu, for the amount of food that comes with it. It's all I ever order anymore. You should make new 5 dollar boxes, where we can choose from a variety of different things to go in it. This way I can eat something different now and then when I go to Taco Bell :o
i get a classic/cherry limeade sparkler before i go to EVERY class since august, i'm obsessed !!!! lol
WHY TACO BELL!.... WHY!!
35% real beef??? Are you kidding me???
I love Taco Bell
May I have a spicy maltodrextrin / soy lecithin / corn starch taco please!? Think outside the taco shell......because you don't want to know what's actually in it! 
I don't really care what Taco Bell uses in their food because I love it and will eat it no matter...and yes, I really mean that 'Soylent Green conspiracy' folks...
I love taco bell, and wish they had them in England !
Dear @TacoBell I enjoy your "seasoned beef" - don't let those negative nancies bring you down. 
Dear Taco bell, bring back the Chili cheese burrito! that is all thank you! 
if you make taco meat with a mccormicks mix, you add water and some unpronouncable ingredients to season your ground beef at home, don't u? just a thought...
<3 u taco bell. <3 ur 35% beef! Corn and Soy are good for you. 35% beef means 65% less cows are being grown and slaughtered for your company. 65% less cows means 65% lower methane emissions. Thus by using only 35% beef you're actually cutting green house gases and helping save the environment! 
My only complaint is that I know some people with Celiac disease who eat there frequently because they can't eat wheat...Now we find out there has been wheat hidden in the beef all along? At least warn people
Taco Bell for Breakfast
all you people hating on taco bell, atleast taco bell isnt like mcdonalds and all that fatty meats and crap
Did you clowns really need a law firm to hire scientists to tell you that the "food" that Taco Bell sells to you isn't really food at all? Do you genuinely think anything manufactured by Pepsi Co, McDonald's and the like was ever food? Wake up people. 
I'm enjoying a huge Nachos Bell Grande right now. Mmmm Taco Bellll....
The BOX MEAL has to be the most brilliant thing ever put on the menu since the grande Quesadia. KEEP IT!!! <3
ppl lie taco bell is made just right if it taste good itz made right
If I want a filling, tasty meal, cheap - I head for Taco Bell. If more lawyers were hungry for a cheesy gordita crunch instead of billable hours, this world would be a better place.
If everyone is so worried about unknowingly eating fillers of dubious origin, maybe they should've looked at the list of ingredients. It's been available online for a long time. Ignorance is no excuse.
Its all good Taco Bell! I'll still eat ya even its only 30% real.
Even though your food is only 35% beef I'll still eat it. XOXO
I LOVE YOU TACOBELL.<3333333
I aint got no beef with yo beef. xD
I lovvvvvvvvvvve taco bell!
This lawsuit is BS, and it'll probably backfire. Reading the article about it made me hungry for Taco Bell
I read an article that your beef is only 36 percent beef on yahoo today, is it true?
Ok...p[lease tell us what the other part of the 65% is that we all thought was meat....beef... I have always loved TAco Bell...spend lots of money there...but till i find this is False and get more info...you have lost out on my business!!!!!!!!! :( Hoping not to hear some Ewwwwy stuff... :(
mmm yummm! Taco Bell :)
Meat by product Tacos!
FUKIN LOVE TACO BELL!!!!! HELL YEAH!!

Thank You, Greg Creed and all Taco Bell employees!! You guys save me from hunger and hit the spot like nothing else!!

Bring back the chicken flatbread sandwich!
I LOVE YOU, TACO BELL!! I COULDN'T CARE LESS WHAT THE RUMORS SAY!! YOU GUYS MAKE THE BEST TEX MEX ON THE PLANET!! XOXOXOXOX

This is like going through a bad break up. I loved you Taco Bell! But no more.
I dont give a shit about your beef, you still taste good...
Taco Bell is one of the best things in my life!!!! thank u!
MMMM TACOS
Taco Bell is one of the top 10 best things about America, and I hope that the woman who sued you is forced into bankruptcy from the legal fees.
Wheres The Beef 
Taco Bell....I still love you! 
I still love you Taco Bell!!!!!!!
Tacobell made Local news here in Roseville CA. Some one is filing a class action lawsuit against tacobell claiming that the Beef does not contain real beef. They are making accusations like "there isnt beef only colored and flavored corn". The sad part is all that I have heard sounds like all the accusations arent based on any facts or evidence they can prove. I hope they dont get a dime for these false accusations. Tacobell will always be the best in fast food. 
Define BEEF please.
I don't care what you make your tacos from, they will always taste the BEST!!!!!
IIIII LUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUVVV <3 <3 TACOOOOOOOS!
so what is not 100% beef .. it is sill good that what i know lol :-)
This is just a test sent from the Great Chalupa in the Sky!!! Weed out the non-believers!!!! All true Taco Bellers have blind faith!!!!!!
I WANT FREE TACOS!! :)
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGET SUED!AH! Taco Bells getting sued D: BUT IMMA HELP YOU NOT
I still love Taco Bell, even if you do use fillers, but I am sure you don't. :) 
I <3 TACO BELL :)
Wheres the Beef?
I LOVE YOU TACO BELL!!!!!!!!!!
I still love you taco bell! Even if ur meat really isnt meat!
Where's the beef?
I love Taco Bell! Always have, always will!!! yummy!!!
I got your back Taco Bell......if you were a woman I would marry you!
36% of the meat having beef does not make it beef. call it what it is and I WILL STILL GOBBLE UP YOUR SOFT SHELL TACOS! YUM! :D
Lets all go to taco Bell and protest!! I will even eat a Beefy Crunch Burrito to demonstrate how its not beef and it your skeptic I'll even eat 3 or four more and I'll do it several times a week as well!!
Bring back the Chicken Ranch Gordita!! Was one of my favorites!
even if its not real meat who cares its way better than half the other crap u guys eat.
Stay strong Taco Bell!
taco bell try as hard as u can to stay.. if u go down we will miss you
I WILL NEVER STOP EATING TACO BELL!
I just had some Taco Bell and it was just as awesome as always. 
anybody tht wont eat at taco bell because of this whole fake meat argument might as well not eat at any fast food resteraunt because nobody really have real meat now adays so just get over taco bell is delicious and thts the way it will stay!
Fishy that Taco Bell getting sued just days after pulling ads from that deplorable mtv program.
Can I just buy a taco with the 30% Beef and leave the rest out? I'd pay another buck for it...
I wuv taco bell tacos :)
I want a taco. :3
Hey Taco Bell, guess what? I love you. I don't eat beef! There, I win.
 Yep them ppl should but their bussiness some where else. Honestly worry about more important stuff this is killing the bussiness I work @ a TH and its been so dead labor shoots up so high they have to let most of us go to make labor. K now what about bks chicken and the texture? How bout not food safety auditors are so annoying with there darn hand helds yelling out nope thats not standard. 
You rock! I don't care that your beef ain't all beef cause it still taste good!
You don't have the right to keep 'fiesta' in cheesy fiesta potatoes anymore since the chives were taken out.
i <3 taco bell
I LOVE TACOOOO S FROM TACO BELL
beef filler tastes soooooo goooooodddd
I love you taco bell you have the greatest food ever!! I eat at your place almost every weekend Friday through Sunday! Well I will be there this Friday for another great breakfast lunch and dinner! <3 
If I give you a taco thats 96% s--t and 4% beef, would you be willing to call that a beef taco? (JR)
Silly Taco Bell, youre getting sued. Shoulda used beef.
Forget the haters. I'm still proposing to my future wife at a Taco Bell.
and this WHOLE TIME... after I've seen the movie Demolitian Man... that Taco Bell won the franchise wars... smh NOW THIS?????
Are you ever going to come out with vegan "beef?" You would get so much more business!!
100% beef for .99 cents? Yeah right. What were people expecting? Top choice sirloin? Look at all these people jumping on TB's ass all of a sudden. It's not surprising though. Some people will always need someone to bitch at. As for me and and many others, I will always <3 you TB. Xoxo. 
Greg Creed, President And Chief Concept Officer I'm sorry to hear about the recent Lawsuit, and I hope you get it settled in a manner suitable to all parties concerned. With that being said, I found it interesting to note that one of your fillers was 'Oats' As I have an allergy to oats and other grains... I do like taco's very much- For those with Grain allergy's, Could you replace the fillers with the seasoned USDA inspected beef that's to be in your taco's. (* I can have only 2 grains one is Corn and the other is Rice) so I've already made a switch from the Double Crunchy Taco I used to order to a crunchy Reg. Taco Supreme. I so miss the flour tortilla's but can no longer have the gluten that's in the tortilla's. And the whole family has enjoyed your various Restaurants and the courteous Staff we've found at each one. Thank you very much for your time , as I know you are very busy - I will be waiting for this to be addressed in a future Post from You. Brenda Drake
QUE VIVA TACO BELL
Taco hell say it ain't so
Re: Statement / Typical neutral "lawyer-approved" PR statement...your statement refers to "facts" but does not answer anything. If your food contains the required amount of beef, then why not just come out and state, on the record, that the product is in compliance and, is indeed beef. :) I would note, that no one (including taco bell) has disputed the 35% finding, which is less than the required amount to legally call them "beef" tacos. What you conveniently avoid in your statement is the fact that you are required to have more than just 35% beef in your food to call them "beef." In fact, I find nothing of significant value in your statement that would persuade me one way or the other. What I do find in your statement is a round-about way of saying "trust us."
So i hear tacobell bein sued cause yall meat is not 100% beef!
I'd love some beef and sour cream with cheese sauce!!
Hey, can I have a free meal next time I visit my local Taco Bell?
I'm craving you so bad right now taco bell....
Dear taco bell. Where is my cheesy double beef burrito? I do not want chips in my burrito. Much love. xx
I'm really want taco bell for breakfast.
Oh Taco bell! Don't worry the negative talk will prove postive in sales. 
long live taco bell looking forward to trying the new stake burrtieo thing once i get money id allways eatat taco bell i know u use 100 pecent usda beef 
Taco Bell @ UMASS Lowell is awesome
I like Taco Bell, It is my favorite fast food. When you make meatloaf, do you add oatmeal, spices sauces...etc... It is still meat. We all add fillers to food to make it stretch, What do you think Hamburger helper is for ? Don't dis my Taco Bell !!!
what is non meat substance? is it unhealthy or gonna make me sick someday. your my fav taco place. so i hope this just gossip
i love TACO BELL! LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!!
The lawsuit is about it being less than 40% beef which is required by the USDA. I personally think it should be 100% beef. 
While I'm "liking" Taco Bell ... remembering my favorites from years past like the "taco light" and crispy cinnamon/sugar tortilla chips.
Luv Taco Bell, been eating there for years, even buy extra to heat up and eat the next day, great food, great value. Would love to see Taco Bell bring back the Bell Beefer humburger they used to serve it was awesome. 
Can someone tell me: is there any gluten in Taco Bell's beef tacos? (crunchy, not soft)
I know I am late with this But TB say it aint so!!! Please make it 100% on all your Meat products, there's enough crap in the food and water supply already. Bad enough they want to make us eat Cloned vegetables and animals without us knowing it. 
The more they talk about the beef on the news, the more I crave Taco Bell. Can't wait for my next run to the border!
Stupid lawyers sue over anything. Really these folks should just be debarred
I think I will stick to burritos. When I worked at taco bell 18 or 19 years ago we actually used real beef. The tacos at Taco Bell lost their taste like 5 or so years ago. Now I know why. I understand the part that is water or spices but all these fillers are crap. They help you get fat and give you no nutrients. Sorry TB but I'm off eating anything from you with that meat type product that you serve.
Bring back the Chicken Flatbread! That was awesome!!! I need it here in Cincinnati if you could please and thank you!
Thank you Taco Bell Great Falls, I love going to lunch, driving over there, spending my money, getting a touchdown box, and not getting my taco. Then opening my burrito and having it be a mess. Way to take pride in quality.
Taco Bell arf arf 
If it wasn't for Taco Bell, I would have starved to death as a teenager. Cheeserito still my favorite....
taco bell beef could be soylent green for all i care. shit is delicious and i will continue to eat it until the day that i die.
So i was at Taco Bell a half hour ago and i intentionally used only the sauce packs that say "taco me" lol
I LOVE TACO BELL!!! :) 
taco bell is the best fast food restaurant that exists
Just wanted to say i love u guys!! 
Urr Volcano taco's rock ...Ps.... Give The Lewiston Taco Bell red Food coloring 
I love tabo bell , y'all need to sells some real beef ...
Every fast food faces some kind of lawsuit everynow and then It'll pass Still got to have my Tacos tho lol
Anyone who wants a natural additive-free meal wouldn't be eating at Taco Bell or any other fast food restaurant. I just like how people are surprised but the meat mixture thing. All I have to say is if you want a quality meal with no additives or preservatives get off your lazy ass and make you own damn tacos!
Look, ive been a long time customer and ive always enjoyed your food. After hearing that the beef can barely be consitered beef, im really disheartened. Can you guys throw me a coupon for something? I think im gonna have to stick to the chickenlike substance from now on...
I love taco bell the way it is. Real or not real beef...its easy to digest :) My hubby has a rare condition and as a result suffers from extremely slow metabolism and digestion. Long story short...when she had a regular taco from taco bell she was able to digest with no problem. I think taco bell should not be intimidated by law suits in this power hungry and bad economy, instead fight it through company honesty and defending their products. 
I'd like to know why the Chicken Ranchero soft taco was pulled from the menu. I loved them... 
In my environmental Bio class we just talked about how the 65% non-meat in your beef is actually healthy and delicious. I'm going to start eating more of your delicious tacos.
The people sueing you are just haters, forget them
Why not use real beef??? (volcano tacos 4life):))
LOVE TACO BELL!!!!
Won't lie. I probably eat taco bell 4 days a week. I love it. But the taco bell in Wiggins MS is poor. Everything from service to quality of the food. Love having a taco bell this close to home but it needs to change. 
I love Taco Bell and there little dogie too. In my option... if it tastes good and doesn't kill then just enjoy! Now it's off to the Bell I go even though snow is falling heavily outside.
Meat or not, im eating whatever the hell I please. Nobody MAKES you eat taco bell. either eat it or make your own damn tacos!! 
Im gettin hungry just thinking about it!
I miss you taco bell..
Ugh, I love Taco bell so much. I will most likely still eat there though. Just please make it 100% beef in the near future. It would be good health wise!
I hope you guys SUE the PANTS off those sons O'Bitches who are slandering your name with FALSE facts!!!! Taco Bell is FOREVER, MY FAVE! I would drive MILES (and I do) just to have you!!!!! xooxoxoxoxo
Yummy! Had tha beefy crunch burrito tha other day and loved it!
HEY TACO BELL! I started a GROUP called LEAVE TACO BELL ALONE! THEY ROCK! Wont you all please join?!
So after watching the news today.. I need to say WHERE'S THE BEEF! wow and all this time I was thinking it was beef...
I LOVE TACO BELL!!! I wish Taco Bell delivered!
i don't give a fuck what u guys use. i will eat Taco Bell 'till the day i die. my sibs and I love this stuff.

Put a Taco Bell in Pella, Iowa! and Ankeny, Iowa!!!!!
omg! i want a taco right now with only cheese on it!!!!
I love Taco Bell! But, getting older, it doesn't love me as much anymore (heartburn galore, but worth it. Just follow it with sime Tums. LOl.) I hate getting older. :(
Bring back the Chicken ranch gorditas!
Taco Bell has tasted progressively worse over the past year or so. I don't know if it's my local stores or what (I've been to more than one). It's not just the meat either; the shells and sauces taste lower-quality than they used to. This is before I heard about the beef controversy, too, so don't take this as me jumping on a bandwagon here. Like an Alzheimer's patient I keep going back hoping it'll taste good again, and each time I'm disappointed. I miss my delicious Mexican Pizzas. :(
We still love you, Taco Bell. We love you for who you are, 40% or not.
All this talk about Taco Bell on the news just makes want Taco Bell..... IU Taco Bell!
ITS NOT REAL BEEF!! 
Wheres the BEEF?
dear taco bell.... all though I could careless about the stupid rumors that are obviously false I would like a burrito that uses that meat they sell in stores w only 4%of fat so I may consume something healthy for once :) I could careless if it costs 5$ I'm already paying 7$ a burrito at el pollo loco haha thank you for reading :)
Bring back the BELL BEEFER SANDWICH!!
Beef Chalupa Sup .I L <3 VE U BIG TIME

How do I add a photo to this page to express my Taco Bell love?
Bring back the Chicken Flatbread Sandwich!!!
I just want to say regaurdless of what people say,your the best fast food on the market!! =)
I don't care if it's 30% beef, the other 70% is love. Taco Bell forever.
Taco Bell, listen. I don't care if the meat in your food is ground up russian orphans--- its delicious. I <3 you.
WHERES THE BEEFY CHEESY MELT? I LOVED THAT. BRING IT BACK PLEASE
it doesent matter you ate it before you knew it still tastes the same "AWESOME" so why does it matter now? hmmmm just like kids and lima beans if you tell them its candy theyl eat it and like it.......if u chang the name to lika beans theyl say no....... TACO BELL RULEs!!!!!!!!!!!1 :D
Bring back the chili cheese burrito and xl chalupa
The food today tastes nothing like it did back in the 60's when I was a young girl and they were newly starting out...Burrito supreme had meat, beans, tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, and sliced olives...it was the BOMB! Now, it's not really worth buying anymore...things change with the times I guess...just wish the beans didn't have trans fats...Good luck, I'm sure this suit will just die out and be forgotten<3
What happened to the spicy chicken burrito?! i loved that thing. Very filling.
OMG I <3 TACO BELL!!!!!!!
i see this whole lawsuit thing pointless.. add more meat in the tacos and keep the price the same and youve just made a whole lot of customers happy.. we all know yall have been getting skimpy on the meat..
I LOVE the Beefy Crunch Burrito!!!!!
Is it really necessary to put wheat in the taco meat? For those of us with gluten allergies it makes it even harder for us to eat out. I honestly don't think people understand about this allergy. I loved taco bell and now i can no longer eat it because you added wheat to your product. I will have to cross taco bell of my safe list.
is it true the crunchy bruito the meat is 30%
How about another meal squeezed in about coffee break time!! :) 
Does Tacobell deliver ?
Just use real beef not this fake meat thats only 30% that fake make could make people sick
HaHa valid point "where's the beef". Taco Bueno doesnt have this "problem" 
Taco Bell is awesome. Keep it up! The only thing that would be better is if there was one closer to where I live! Anyway I will still be eating there!
luv taco bell and will not give up my taco bell
Dear taco bell, i love your food so flippin much!!!!!!!! Sincerly, your biggest fan me! :)
I love Taco Bell!
How come the best fruitista Orange Creme is removed? Market research plz?
Instead of denying what everyone knows Taco Bell should simply fix the quality of there food. Taco Bell's recipe does seem to have changed over the years and not for the better. Why would you need to put other "ingredients" into a time honored food such as a taco.. One could hardly call it that, I mean honestly would you rather have other ingredients or a real mexican steet taco? I would say the real mexican steet taco.. Taco Bell lost its way and is now trying desparately to defend what they should just be fixing. Like all companies in American when faced with change they need to step up and stop making excuses for there products. Just FIX IT. 
I love your Tacos, especially the BEEF ones!!!
I just ate at taco bell... I KNOW I did not eat 88% beef. It also had a hint of tomato, sour cream, lettuce, nacho sauce, a crunchy center, and a soft grilled out side... It was a CRUNCH WRAP SUPREME!!!! NUM NUM NUM
What does chuck Norris eat? Taco bell....nuff said...
I'm more filler than meat too, Taco Bell beef. I won't hold it against you!
Taco Bell. I still, and will always love you. Haters Gon Hate
Nacho cheese gordita..Awesome!
AUUUUUUUUGH Bring back the Fully Loaded Nachos Deal!!!! PLEEEZ I BEG OF YOU!!!!
we needs to bring the flate bread back.. they was good..
Guess whats new? ...The new Quad Steak Burrito: With four times the thick, juicy, marinated steak, its sure to fill you up! Four portions* of new thick and tender steak, all wrapped in a warm flour tortilla filled with seasoned rice, fire-roasted salsa, reduced-fat sour cream and cheddar cheese. http://www.tacobell.com/menuitem/Quad-Steak-Burrito Legal Stuff: At participating locations for a limited time. *Four times the steak compared to a Steak Burrito Supreme.
i saw the thing on the news about the lawsuit whatever tastes like beef to me good enough hahah
 Bring back the chipotle grilled stuffed burrito. Please for my birthday :)
Every time I hear about the lawsuit, it only makes me crave Taco Bell even more... love the food, whatever it is!
On the way home from work I begged my dad for Taco Bell... He acted like he didn't want it... Then as we got closer to home he detoured off and got us TB... I'm so glad you guys are open past 10 (everything else around us is closed), it's basically the only thing we get to eat when we have to work late! And it's soooo good! I love the Verde and the fire roasted sauces! (and most of your food too! hah!
WHERE'S THE BEEF?
bring back the spicy chicken soft taco! 
Mmm...I <3 Ur Fire Sauce I Always Steel A Handfull Of Ur Fire Packet Sauce's...I Wish They Sold It In A Jar @ The Store's!!!!
Beefy Crunch Burrito <3 but i miss the chalupa XXL
About how much is that new quad steak burrito? Hopefully you won't get rid of the 99 cent burrito so college kids can survive.
I couldn't help but to notice your new Quad Steak Burrito. Give me a reason why I shouldn't pass up on this...
My girlfriend and I really think you should change the name of the Beefy Crunch Burrito to the Flamin' Frito Burrito! It has such a better ring to it! :)
first place i'm going when i get back from afghanistan is Taco Bell!!!
Haha your being sued...Where"s the beef?
Dear taco bell, If i had all the money back that ive spent on your food, i could be going to school right now thank you for being delicious! <3 cory
What the fuck! How am I suppose to have my 4th meal when the damn taco bells here in phoenix az close at midnite on the weekdays and 1am on weekends. This is an outrage! 
I dont give two fucks what the meat is I L.O.V.E TACO BELL!!! fuck the haters!
just had me some taco bell tonight! woot!
Dear Taco Bell how I love your 5 big box meal, such an awesome deal!!
Why does anyone care about the meat filler? Taco bell tastes too good for it to matter. The crap you have to take after is unsightly but still worth it. ;)
Seriously, after a few beers WHO FREAKIN CARES what you're eating??? Tastes like goddamn STEAK!! So here's to all of u who are SUEING & complaining about this GREAT fake mexican drive thru... DO YOU EAT HOT DOGS??? WTF is in THAT?? Chicken beaks, cow guts, & eyeballs. Does Oscar Myer tell u whats on the package? NO! So STFU if u don't like Taco Bell than drive the F by & leave all the Taco Surpremes for ME! Okay now you need to look down your pants & ask WHERE'S THE BEEF???
We love you taco bell :D
I HAVE TACO BELL AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK 88 PERCENT BEEF YEEAAHHHH
Don't be a food snob, eat Taco Bell.
The Rancero Tacos need to come back. Now! I loved them. Especially with the avocado sauce. Yum!
heard your guys' meat isnt real, that sucks D:
Pleasssseeee bring taco bell to scotland!!!!!!!
Mmmm i was reading about the lawsuit and i'm so hungry for taco bell now. <3 you
The lawsuit is absurd. Is there any sort of petition or show of support that we can show to help? This lawsuit is a perfect example of what's wrong with our tort system.
CUD WE HAVE TACO BELLS IN UK PLS ????
Cud we have Taco in Poland?
aaahhh the only taco bell near me is under construction and I can't take it anymore please transport some taco's to me ASAP!!!!
If Taco Bell delivered there would be sooooo many less drunk drivers. Seriously, it would be doing the community a favor. :D Please?
I love taco bell its the shit
I heard TacoBell is getting into some "beef" trouble!
i love the beef but wat is up with the news saying Taco Bells beef aint beef? I would like to here back
Beef or fake beef I still love it
THANK you for pulling your ad off SKINS !!!! YOU ROCK !
the chicken and the steak are all real. And the other 70% of the taco beef is soy and wheat filler. Perfectly edible.
All this b.s. about the beef supposedly not being all beef, blah blah blah. The news story I saw said it was beef with oats, wheat, and soy. Ok, so, um, even if it were true, wouldn't that technically make it even healthier to eat anyway? What's the big deal? Rock on Taco Bell! My family are still loyal customers!
I really don't care about the stupid lawsuit up against your corporation. I still LOVE taco bell! I just wish y'all would come out with more Atkins diet friendly options!
taco bell rules
so what's the other 65percent of the beef!?
hey what ever happened to the taco bell chihuahua? and the kewl krazy straws with eyeballs!?!? lol love the new beefy crunch burrito.. its amazing grilled with extra fritos! yumm.. gonna go get some now :) 
I don't care about the beef issue...Taco Bell is way tastier and much better for you than all that other crap sold at the burger places. Taco Bell is manna from heaven!
Hey!! Oats, Wheat and Soy never tasted so good!
Taco Bell same on you! I am looking at the picture of the Quad steak Burrito and it looks yummy and is making me hungry!!! 
What is sad is that rich lawyers can sit in a million dollar office and create lies to get richer. Taco Bell Meat has 88% usda approved Beef. 12% is seasons and spice to give it flavor. If you have questions go to the Taco bell website...... Dont believe the hype.....
I have to work late tonight, but that's great, because that's also Taco Bell Night! <3 You Taco Bell! Don't listen to the haters."5,391,268 People Like This"!
Love Soft shell Taco's.
The way I see it, if you don't like the 88% USDA approved ground beef then why not try another option, the chicken and steak choices are awesome! o the Quad Steak Burrito looks really good!
i love taco bell
I love Taco Bell! :) Who cares what all those people are saying!
fake or real beef taco bell is still amazing!!
Taco Bell night every Wednesday at my house. I wish they hadn't stopped the XXL Chalupas
I <3 taco bell and I <3 all the possitive comments on here!!! I bet this stupid lawsuit is actually goona help TB cuz of all the press and all the ppl who <3 TB just gonna go out and eat more of it!!! Taco Bell u "ROCK"!!!

any plans on getting your delicious tacos to Norway soon?
I want some friggin Taco Bell right now. Hmm 5 layer burrito. Yummmm. (:
Can u bring back the spicy chicken burrito please please?? 
What about chicken flatbread will it come back
I was thinking about my Meatloaf recipe, Ground Beef, Oatmeal, Breadcrumbs, onions, garlic, Stewed Tomatoes, Salt & Pepper, Parsley, water and Chives. Can I still call it MEAT Loaf or will I be hit with a Lawsuit because it isnt 100% Meat? It's called Cooking and , Chefs all over the world ADD things to meat to make there food taste better and follow recipes, Ive always loved Taco bells food and seems millions of other do as well, I think if you dont like it dont eat there. If there isn't somthing in it thats unsafe to eat then what is the issue?
Is there any word on if the chicken flatbread thing will be back? 
THE QUAD STEAK BURRITO IS HEAVEN IN A FLOUR TORTILA 
Bring back the Bellbeefer!!!! 
please taco bell in guadalajara mexico!!
taco bell. you are the best thing that has ever happened to me
Pretty sure I had crunch wrap, two 5 layers and soft taco last night and I tell you that meat was amazing lol screw that lawsuit 
I really wish people would do research. The only "meat" that is being brought up in the lawsuit is the hamburger. The lawsuit is about how much (%) is hamburger and how much is filler (soy and oat products)!!! Oh and BTW, Taco Bell, I just ate your quad steak burrito! It was so yummy! 
BRING BACK CHILI CHEESE BURRITO!!!!!! PERMANENTLY!!!!!!!!!!!
I Just tryed taco bell for 1 1st time and im 13 
I just had Taco Bell for dinner an hour ago, including a beef taco. It was so good-- whatever it was!
I went out today and purposely bought three beef soft tacos at Taco Bell and enjoyed them immensely...just to STICK IT to the man. Is this what it feels like to be a smoker?
I love the Taco Meat!
Would like to thank the Taco Bell in Spokane, Washington on the Newport HWY. for throwing in free Cinnamon Twists for my "Wait" only waited, not even two minutes, have waited longer then that at other places and got nothing!

HEY, I CAME UP WITH A NEW SLOGAN FOR TACO BELL. L.A.S.T.? uh uh. NEW SLOGAN IS F.U.C.K. Taco bell. Friendly, Urgency, Caring, and Kind. yay.. lmao 
I don't care if you don't use real beef n junk. It's fuckin delicious!
Taco bell justget real meat then i will eat there again
In the ad it says seasoned beef it never states how much seasoned beef. I have been eating it for years. All fast food chains mix their meat with other ingrediants, who cares? It taste good!!!! leave Taco bell alone.
I have but one claim about the beef served at taco bell. WHY IS IT SO DAMN GOOD?! I love how i can drive or walk to taco bell with only a few dollars in my wallet but get a meal that's filling but easy on my wallet! thanks taco bell! granted, i know this sounds like a suck-up comment, but after the accusations against you, i thought you might need to read something a little more inspiring. 
I agree with SmittyWerbenjagermanjenson. I do remember the McDonald's thing. If Taco Bell has less beef in it, wouldn't that still be good cuz it's more veggie stuff. Btw way I'm bringing taco bell for lunch tonite at work. Ummmm yum!
What a ridiculous lawsuit. I'm heading to Taco Bell today for lunch. Great food!
So what if there's a lil sand in the meat? Still taste better than Mic Ds soy protein burgers. Love Taco Bell! Oan great advertising props to the CEO, THanks for suing Us
I'm glad you're fighting the class action lawsuit. Every time a company pays these pirnah off, it encourages them to sue someone else. All they care about is fattening their pockets on the backs of hard working citizens. I don't usually eat fast food but I might start frequenting Taco Bell!
you guys should really just take advantage of vertical integration and place your franchises on the beach, less transportation costs.
Taco Bell is Amazing!
wendy's did wheres the beef , we know that taco bell ' s beef is real and taste great
they also have chili peppers on a stick ?
Just to set the record straight...I'm not suing you!!! Love you guys, and I'll always think outside the bun!!!
I love taco bell and this class action suit will not stop me from eating taco bell!
I LOVE TACO BELL!!!!!!!!
This law suite is just a way of saying they are miserable and have nothing better to do with there lives!! i love Taco Bell.
I don't care if it's all beef or not, I love everything Taco Bell fixes (and don't believe all of the news anyway).
I love Taco Bell food!! Taco Supremes and Cheese Roll Ups!
says Bravo Taco Bell for your beefesque product. Even if it is only 35% well I say just eat 3 of them ...to get 105% 
TACO BELL FOR LUNCH ON THIS GORGEOUS DENVER FRIDAY! WHO'S WITH ME?
COMMON SENSE PEOPLE!!! 88% of Taco Bell's Taco Meat Mixture uses 100% BEEF...meaning the Beef itself is not beef byproduct or crap like that. When you make tacos at home, you cook the 100% beef then you add all your taco seasonings and what not and what you end up with is Taco meat with 85-95% beef and the rest seasoning and fillers...SAME FREAKIN' DIFFERENCE!!!
My very first job was at Taco Bell. I personally cooked the beef a time or two. This is absurd!! I'm feeling Taco Bell for lunch today people!!
i dont care what they say, taco bell is delicious and thats all that matters. it will always be my favorite fast food restaurant <3
Taco Bell, you make great food! I have a suggestion.... maybe you team up with @Morningstar Products and use their beef crumbles and their chick'n and give vegetarians some options to be able to buy more great TB products. Just something to think about.
After watching that video i am definitely trying to make my own taco bell meat at home..thanks for the secret recipe
Can have a grill chicken Cesar burrito please. Thank you.
Taco bell needs a shreaded chicken option
I don't care what they say about you, Taco Bell. I love your tacos just the way they are :)
I just had your Double Steak Burrito. Wow was it good and filling. I can't imagine the Quad Steak Burtito. It must be huge.
Because of the lawsuit I am eating EXTRA Taco Bell this week!!!!!
bring back the bell beefer 
I just read the Giant Ad "Taco Bell" took out in the Los Angeles Times. "Thank you for suing us! Brilliant...Awesome...Love it! Way to go Greg Creed! I'm going to Taco Bell tonight to celebrate! Let's help Taco Bell increase sales! Great Ad!
TACO BELL I LOVE YOU!!!! NOW MORE THAN EVER!!
i <3 taco bell..
Your beef is awesome! I've been eating it for over 20 years and I'm healthy & fit. Keep up the good work!!
I worked at Taco Bell for a few years when I was putting myself through school and ALL their ingredients were natural and the BEEF was definitely BEEF. Stand strong Taco Bell! 
I used to work at an express Taco Bell in a Casino.......It was a sweet job, I love the food, I wish there was a Taco Bell where I live now :( What do you think Taco Bell, could you build one here? Manzanita, OR......
I think the beef y'all use is the best. Don't let them intimidate you into changing. Good Luck
Just had a chili-cheese burrito. I don't care what those people say, Taco Bell most definitely uses BEEF!
I love taco bell i will stand behind taco bell forever heidi
Your food is insanely delicious. What person has nothing better to do other than attack the wholesome beefy goodness of Taco Bell? Apparently one bitter crazy lady. STAY TRUE TACO BELL!! WE SUPPORT YOU! &hearts;&hearts;
been sick all week, today I finally felt better and went and got my favorite food .... Taco Bell, made me so happy! got a crunchy beef burrito and a beefy 5 layer burrito! Taco Bell fur immer!!!!!! <3 <3 
Mmmm.... Tacos....
Definitely impressed with the way your company has responded to those so-called allegations - we still love Taco Bell!
I know the idea behind the lawsuit was to tear you down but in reality all it is doing is making me crave taco bell everyday lol
Keep yer chin up taco bell :). I know you got the beef
IM WAITING FOR TACO BELL TO OPEN IN SAUDI ARABIA - RIYADH GOD!!! IM THE NUMBER 1 FAN OF TACO BELL
IM WAITNING FOR TACO BELL TO OPEN IN SAUDI ARABIA - RIYADH
Even though I usually get chicken at Taco Bell, I know that the beef is totally legitimate and delicious. Anyone who makes false claims against Taco Bell is an enemy of mine! You guys will win and hopefully get compensated quite well! <3 y'all!
I don't care what your "beef" is made out of. It's delicious and I will keep eating it!
i went to taco bell yesterday and i got the 5 buck box. it was amazing. lol.
Just went to Taco Bell by my house and imagine my horror to discover they're no longer carrying the Cheesy Gordita Crunch!!! NOoooooooooo!! It threw off my whole order! LOL 
I have always loved Taco Bell. Dont let the haters get you down. Team Taco Bell.
88% BEEF! Screw those people suing you T-Bell. I LOVE YOU!
*'Thank You For Suing Us'* That's the headline on fullpage ads Taco Bell is taking out in newspapers across the country Taco Bell claims that what they use is 88% beef and the rest other ingredients. the surers claim its 38% is beef. I say if its good and hasn't killed anyone yet why mess with them about what they or how much "beef" they put in it but let me know what you think in the comment box below.
Dear Taco Bell, I support you all the way!!! And I love your beef!!!
By attacking my Beefy 5 Layer, they are attacking me! For the good of all that is beefy, beany, nacho cheesy and 12% seasoning, I am behind you all the way!
All the publicity has worked me up an appetite for some Taco Bell Nachos..yummy!!!
i say fuck those people who make false accusations, i love taco bell, always will, keep doing what you are doing.
Those who don't like the Bell stay home and cook your own meat! I LOVE ME SOME BEEF MEXIMELTS!
Wonder if me sitting here thinking about Taco Bell & then a friend "just happening" to "like" Taco Bell that moment means I should go to the Bell for dinner????
Beef or only 35% beef, I'll still eat it! It's delicious keep up the great work Taco Bell! Yo quiero Taco Bell!
I LOVE TACO BELL 
Beef is good to me....why the big fuss????

I have been eating Taco Bell most of my life. The taste and texture of you beef is fine and your food is always fresh and wholesome, keep up the great work.
Taco Bell is the greatest, keep up the good work!
Dear Taco bell i love your food and im glad its no less than 50% ral beef. Thanks for setting the record straight. But can you find it in your heart to start giving us 100% beef with no fillers?? Just saying because now that i know its not 100% i realize y it takes a lot of tacos to have my fill and id like to get full. Thank you love you still.
I love you Taco Bell!! I will support you no matter what! thank you for helping me get through college on a budget!
I havnt heard from anyone dieing from eatting damn Taco Bell so they can take that lawsuit and shove it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love Taco Bell. My dad told me that he would never buy me that ever again. I don't even get tacos with meat on them, so this doesn't affect me. I will always support the Taco Bell cause :)
Did taco bell really get sued for not using resl meat or is this a rumor? Cuz i still be wantin me sum taco bell shytt
I just go back from driving 20 min to buy a #6! and when I got home, the tards there forgot to put MEAT in my chalopa! WTF?
I don't care WHAT'S in Taco Bells beef...better not change a THING! I eat there 4 times a week.
Stupid ppl wit stupid lawsuits!! Almost every fast food joint is the same! They just wanna take the mexican food away from us!! Lol... I love taco bell...
I don't care if the filling is made of sawdust, it's AWESOME!!
we don't know what's in any of the food we eat out in fast food places and restaurants. this is a frivolous law suit. this person just wants money. like they said he didn't even contact taco bell to get the facts. also if we allow this we might as well go after all restaurants which is stupid. it will also open the door for everybody to sue these companies for nothing. 
I Love Taco Bell!!!! 
It's funny y'all have an item on the diet menu that means "fatty" n spanish.
per article taco bell says that what they use is 88% beef, 3% water, 4% seasonings and 5% other ingredients. i'll have a mexican pizza please :)
so i heard taco bell beef is actually less than 30% beef, i dont think u can call it beef in that case
per Taco Bell they use 88% beef, 3% water, 4% seasonings and 5% other ingredients.
Hey Taco Bell, I'm working up some people from here in Birmingham, Alabama to go down to the law firm in Montgomery to protest their charges against you. The situation is just absolutely ridiculous. I hope I'm able to work it out!
I just think it's kind of funny that anyone thinks they have the right to sue Taco Bell because they don't make their meat mixture a certain way. I know that when I make meatloaf, I use "100% real" beef, and then I mix it with oats and eggs and spices. That's how I make MY meatloaf recipe. If you want your dinner to only contain boring unseasoned ground beef, make your own damn taco. If you don't like it, don't eat it. And please get lost so that the rest of us can enjoy our meals. :)
Y did u guys get sued! D: u have the best tacos ever! i love ur tacos! especially the volcano burrito
everybody likes taco bell
eating out is a choice. if u don't like taco bell stay home. how can u sew taco bell for a choice u made to eat out.
GET THE FACTS FIRST per Taco Bell they use 88% beef, 3% water, 4% seasonings and 5% other ingredients.
Why are the Taco Bells in Port St. Lucie Fl constantly raisin their prices...twice in a window of three months...$2.09 for a mexi-melt...$5.79 for three tacos and a drink...$1.39 for a crunchy taco...I'm sorry Taco Bell...I must divorce you for your competitors $1 menus...They ain't great, but I can afford them!!!
BRING BACK THE SPICY CHICKEN CRUNCH WRAP SUPREME!!! along with all the other spicy chicken products
we all know whats going down with our tacos, but we don't care its delicious and cheap, keep up the good work and will be visiting shortly
Idgaf if its fake meat im eating you as I txt you TB rock!
Much nicer to have a drive to Taco Bell than a sad life at home. It's at least nice from ages 4-16. God bless you all.
Greg, I just read your full page letter in the wall street journal. You rock : ) I loved it !!!! 
you guys shouls still be sponsors for x-games!!!!!!
I don't care what those assholes say. I love you, taco bell!
Even if your beef is only 36%...I don't care. I'll still support Taco Bell! :]
You should totally sell 3 tacos for $1.05 and call it the "105% beef taco deal" just to be a smartass to those crooked lawyers. HAHA <3
Wheres the BEEF??? Heck, I dont care at all. It is still good to me no matter what!!!
I use to eat at Taco Bell till I figured out there was not much "BEEF" in your Taco's!!! I believe you will lose you Lawsuit. I will not be eating at "Taco Bell till you all get this "FIXED!"
YALL GOING TO GET REAL BEEF NOW??????????????????
I have spent over say $300 in my lifetime on taco bell and have gone to taco bell more than a dozen times and I have never had bad tasting food or anything wrong with my visits. I don't know why people would want to jump to lawsuits and etc. If something is wrong, don't lose heart and make things worse for everyone instead try to resolve the problem so everyone can remain happy. Viva La Taco Bell!
I'll never leave you Taco Bell! Your gorditas are just way to good! :) I loved your quick response to the lawsuit also! Your CEO needs a raise haha! #TeamTacoBell
I <3 Taco Bell!!
Isn't good to mess with the Bell, and accuse them of putting in their shell meat that you say is not beef, and file a ridiculous brief. The taste buds will ultimately tell! <):-)
30% beef 70% delicious 
I love Taco Bell, worked for the company several years ago and they strive to serve quality!
I love that people who previously enjoyed Taco Bell are taken aback by this and swearing it off now. Seriously? You're surprised? You're SO SHOCKED AND OFFENDED that you felt the need to 'like' this page just to bitch? Ha ha ha, oh wow. I'll continue enjoying Taco Bell. I don't give a damn if it's soy, at least one can't be cruel to a soy bean plant like one can be to a cow anyway. By the way, I hope you know what's in your delicious hot dogs, 'chicken' nuggets and those hamburgers, too. Happy eating, children. You'll eat anything the media feeds you. Om nom nom.
I AM HUNGRY FOR CRUNCHY DELUXE TACO BELL TACOS!!!
Asking if Taco Bell's beef is real beef is like asking how many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop...the world may never know. 
I still like you Taco Bell.
I LOVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVE you taco bell
Where's the beef?
Hurry up and give us the flatbread back, my love.
BRING BACK THE BELLBEEFER AND PROVE THEM WRONG!!! I LOVE TACO BELL!!!
When I worked at Taco Bell in High School, we cooked the beef on site. I still like Taco Bell...always will!
idc whats in the beef. all i want is my XXL chalupa.
Taco Bell is The Shitt!!!!!!
Why sue Taco Bell? I mean at least they have something inside the shell. They should be sueing KFC! Look, its all skin and bones and no meat. You get more chicken from a chicken wing at 7-11 compared to KFC!!! 90% Bones, 10% skin and no chicken meat at all!!!
wt time dos tacobell close?
I like their swift response. Set the record straight...if 88% beef what EXACTLY is the 12%? Is the chicken real? Just wondering what am I putting in my teens? 
I saw your full page 'ad' in the SF Chronicle today and I think that it was well written and a good idea. I like the way that you pointed out that plain ground beef can be a little tasteless. Anyone who cooks knows that one needs to season ground beef. 
I want a Taco Bell in Germany! When you come to Germany?
taco bell is great!!! been eating it for the last 30 years. not everyday. but if you dont like taco bell. theres something wrong with you. go eat mickey d's, garbage!!!
I don't really care how much beef is in it. Gotta have me a burrito once in awhile.
I don't eat Taco bell just don't like it my kids like it I just read thr full page thank you in the philly faily news good for greg and all involved way to put it out there! 
I understand the need for flavoring when it comes to ground beef. I do the same thing at home when grilling out doors or making a meat loaf for dinner. No big deal to me Taco Bell.
Read that Taco Bell will open up in UK in 2010/11. Is something happening there? Is there any plans for the rest of Europe? Think Sweden's been ready for it for the last 20 years at least... :/
volcano tacos Mmmmmmm lol
the more i hear about you guys being sued the more I want tacos and tort reform. and doesn't the USDA standard for selling beef only apply to selling it as a stand alone product? I.E. like at the super market.
I still love you taco bell! but I gota ask... How real is the chicken and steak? 
As a Public Relations student studying this lawsuit/case, I would hope that Taco Bell comes clean with the entire recipe. They must be transparent. They should provide video of their meat, how its made, lab results on EXACTLY what is in it. This is an opportunity to receive a positive look and an opportunity to gain the public's trust. I hope they get it worked out. Either way, I still love Taco Bell. 
Real carne por favor! Carumba lol
wheres the beef?
I love Taco Bell X Lax For America on the cheap !!! Real beef is for Sissy Men Real Men eat beef substitute !!!!!
I really do love TB, especially when they make my food just right and it comes out hot. Just like all fast food places you have to think what is really in this stuff we're eating. Most of it is straight crap!
I still love you Taco Bell. I will still eat my taco supremes and enchiritos etc. 
Taco Bell... Flatbreads please? ...Please? I think I speak for the general public when I say i'll eat there every day if you bring them back.
Dear Taco Bell, I still love you! And so do all of my friends! Sincerely, Cherie Masterson Zachary, LA
I want Taco Bell now more than ever! One thing I always wonder though, are the Tostadas a regional item? Why are they not listed on the regular website menu? (I see them on the nutritional disclosure) I get one every time I eat at Taco Bell!
This lawsuit really makes me hungry for Taco Bell. I haven't been to Taco Bell lately but now im freaking craving it bad!
Plz send me a lifetime supply of crunch wraps supremes 
im eatting taco bell
Dear Taco Bell, I hear you guys are getting sued for artificial beef. personally i don't care, so a defense you guys can use is " what did the public expect for really cheap food?" i mean real beef wouldn't obviously be that cheap. so there for fillers are added to make the great tasting/cheap food everyone loves.
Taco Bell, you know I love you like a crack addict loves his rocks, but...Ingredient Force? Please don't go that route.
During these arduous times that Taco Bell faces, it is of the utmost significance that all the true and loyal TB patrons stand by this great and noble establishment. I for one, will continue to frequent the Crunchwrap Supremes, the holiest of fast food grails. And I am proud that Taco Bell continues to use the perfect concoction of beef-byproducts and other obscure ingredients to deliver the best, authentic Mexican experience. 
I love cheese !
so.. is it true taco bell is getting shut down??
I love the food.. but coco powder in the beef??.. that is so freaking cool... maybe you should stress your incorporate culinary delights so the masses would be more impressed?
I have a new slogan for you guys.....here it goes.....ready " Hey................Whats in your Taco? " BTW....bring back the XXL Chalupa
i love taco's
you guys should change the cinnamon twist with mini churros :D
I walk into Taco Bell and always know exactly what I'm getting: 5 Layer buritto, Nacho Belle Grande, mt. dew! Taco bell is amazing
Taco Bell everytime i go to your store, i order volcano nachos because it is the best invention ever. I order it without jalapenos and with extra sour cream and cheese. But everytime i do that, it just seems like it freaks the employees out so they forget to and volcano sauce. This saddens me
Love me some Taco Bell! Whole wheat soft shells would be nice, better for you and taste the same.
Dear Taco Bell, I will soon be going to get a delicious 5layer burrito, chicken burrito, and cheesy double beef burrito. :) I love you. <3 Your #1 Fan, Nichole Visnesky
Who knew today is National Corn Chip Day? Time to celebrate with some nachos Mmmm! http://www.tacobell.com/food/nachos
i <3 your tacos
i love taco bell
I <3 you, Taco Bell! ^-^ Hang in there!
so whats up with ur beef? how can it only be 35% real beef? thats false advertisement.
Y'all should get delivery. I'm just sayin delivery pizza closes @ 10pm. What are we supposed to eat when we all been drinking all night and can't drive?? If u deliver all night y'all b making a smart move.
Taco bell rules. stop makin up lies about them. if you dnt like it dnt eat it. its fucking simple or are u just fukin retarded. GO TACO BELL YOU ARE AWESUM IN MY TUMMY
Taco Bell is the best! Hang in there! You won't lose any business from me! :)
Let's start a petition! WHO WILL STILL EAT AT TACO BELL? I will! 
I luv u taco bell fuk the haters
Come on, who didn't know taco bell wasn't all meat? 
: I'm really bummed the Taco Bell here in Grand Forks North Dakota doesn't have those "Cantina" tacos anymore. They were the most authentic "late night mexican bar" tacos i've ever had. I can even smell the drunks when i'm eating those tacos. Please bring them back! They were so yummy! -Big fan.
If you guys have to raise your prices because of that stupid lawsuit, I'm going on a manhunt in Alabama. I <3 Taco Bell. Besides, nothing that they listed was bad for you anyway, and some of those things are being incorporated into 5 star cuisine to acheive desired textures. Dang...this is making me hungry...I guess I know where I'm going for dinner!!!
I love taco bell its the best place ever. 
I LOVE TACO BELL :)) when i go to USA, is my first food when arrive :)), cheers from MEXICO
I just wanted to say that I legitimatally almost died last nigh from eating taco bell hahaha. I choked on it and my cousin laughed and asked me if I was choking. damn tacobell almost killed me haha 
Oh great taco bell... true story. In my early 20' s i surfed almost every day. After the surfing and even the days i didn't surf I ate Taco bell. I wish I kept the receipts because I ate your food EVERY DAY FOR ONE YEAR!!! No joke. 365 days of taco/burrito goodness. I'm now 37 and I still enjoy your food, ( I just don't eat it every day) The new Quad Steak Burrito is delicious. Nice save after that nasty hot chip burrito.
I'm having Taco Bell again tonight just to show you guys how much I love your food. Please bring back the green onions though, I miss them.
Taco Bell is all that is good and delicious in this crazy world! Just had me a 100% real BEEFY 5 layer, so good! <3 Taco Bell
Quad Steak Burrito...........OFF THE FREAKIN HOOK!!!!
To the punks that are suing Taco Bell,leave em alone.I still love the food.They need to get a life.
Love,Love the food. Need more chains of stores,and can I please get some more sour cream? Yummmm : ) 
Taco Bell has got to be my all-time favorite fast food restaurant! My 2 that I frequent, Edgewood and Bel Air, are nice and clean, and I really have had no serious problems with the food. Sometimes, I'll get Taco Bell on my own and then meet up with my girlfriend and she wants it, too. I do not mind! :D I'm always in the mood for some T Bell! You guys rock and I stand by you!
I LOOOOOOVE TACOO BELL! I WISH I COULD HAVE IT MORE BUT MI BITCH ASS FAMILY ALWAYS WANT STUPID ASS MCDONALDS!
We love Taco Bell. I think you should bring it to Australia.
sucks about the lawsuit. I don't eat meat, so whenever I do hit up TB I order everything substituted with bean anyway...
I don't care what they say, I still <3 you, Taco Bell!
a single item from taco bell that would fill me up... never thought i'd see the day. thanks, the quad stead burrito is pretty freakin awesome!
mmmm....taco bell, no beef..who cares
Eating some TB beef right now! Delish as always! <3 me some Taco Bell!!!
is there an email for complaints, had a very bad experience with taco bell about 20 minutes ago.
eatting a beefy crunch right now! muy bueno. 
i love you. i need your meat
also,please bring back the chilicheese burrito.....i miss it sooooooo much.
Taco Bell! Whatever you do, don't make a settlement. These idiots behind this lawsuit don't deserve a dime!
in pennsylvania they dont have the chillito burrito colorado does its so bomb with sour cream and potatoe bites
Dear Taco Bell, I would just like to tell you that I never thought your "meat" was 100%, frankly I don't care. I enjoy your food and hope all this doesn't set you back too much. But, come on guys. Play it within the law.
still love ya,taco bell!;)
Quad-steak burrito......gods gift to me! Thank you!
The Taco Bell here in Fort Collins, RAN OUT of food! on a Saturday night! In a college town at 1:30, i think we should get some free food!
I like Taco Bell
I discovered Taco Bell in college and love it!! If Taco Bell wins the lawsuit, how about "free taco" day!!?
Love the "Thank you for suing us." ads. They make me want to make a run for the border! I hope the company prevails but if you lose, tender payment in Taco Bell coupons.
taco bell you will prevail. its not like other companies use real stuff always. i mean mc nuggets are made of by products. ive seen bk use microwaves to heat the burges (flame broiled my ace). and supposedbly mc donalds meat has some weird things in it when you see it under a microscope. ive always loved and still do love taco bell, many awesome moments have happened with my friends in taco bell.
The 5 buck box is the olny thang i like at taco bell! 
LOVEEEEEE TACO BELL!!!!!!! 
lol at the meatlike filling taco bell uses as quoted 
Taco Bell and the lawsuit: You know what I really don't care what they have in their burritos, I like them. The chain is socially responsible and cares about older citizens. We live in a community of about 20k and it is age restricted to 55 or older, the Taco Bell store is crowded every day. A senior can get a meal for a $1 and even get a free drink. Well done Taco Bell thanks for caring. 
came to germany! -.- we want taco bell in germany! :DDD
Just want you to know that I am standing by you in all this lawsuit crap. I have been a fan pretty much all 29 yrs of my life and you will always be my fav fast food resturant :) nothin but love for ya &hearts;
OK...to the idiot who started the whole lawsuit mess; get a hobby. May I suggest playing in traffic? You obviously have WAAAYYYYY too much free time on your hands. No one is forcing you to eat there at gunpoint.If you don't like their food, go somewhere else, but for the love of God and all things holy, don't ruin it for the rest of us. To Taco Bell; Your food is fantastic, don't change a thing
I Love Taco Bell ,, It's True Mexican Food ,, And Very Heathly I Just Love It So Very Much (; <3 
Quad Steak burrito kicks ass... Don't ever let it go.
My enchrito today was wonderful. The ground beef, onions, beans on a flour tortilla with sauce and melted cheese -- oh, so good. And a dessert of cinnamon twists. I call that a great Sunday dinner. 
This lawsuit is crap! When you charge 89 cents for a taco, what do people expect... beef tenderloin?????!!!! I will continue buying tacos from TB because they're yummy! This lawsuit won't stop me!
Please bring back the chicken tostada!!! I love my Bell <3
omg quad steak burrito omg guys wtf is next how does it get better than quad?
I could go for some Taco Bell.
Dear Taco Bell, i just had the new Quad Steak Burrito combo. It was REALLY good, but i think it shoulda been called "taste like beef jerky", lol <3
Thank you Taco Bell for having cheap-ass food available when we were poor and really needed to eat and still have money for gas. 
u guys SUCK!!!!! i want the chicken enchilada burrito back u JERKS!!!!
I just wanted to let you know I'd die without your Chili cheese burritos!
Leave Taco Bell alone.Their seasoned meat/meat product makes me happy
Taco bell I <3 you, no matter what. :)
When you coming back zesty chicken balls
you can tell tacobell's meat doesnt have all that much beef in it, but it still tastes great :D i'm cravin' me some beef stuft burrito with extra baja and sourcream
Taco Bell 35% Beef, 110% delicious!!!!
I <3 you Taco Bell!
i love TB just sayin
Taco Bell for dinner... Can't forget the Baja Blast!
Except for the stuff that says partially hydrogenated soybean oil and anything with artificial red and yellow coloring, sounds okay. I can eat the rest. Am allergic to TBHQ in popcorn, I know.
They put a small amount of beef in their taco and it is cheap. 
I'm sick of all of this hating..... Taco Bell food rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG. Taco Bell, you would by far be the best thing in the UNIVERSE if you delivered food! that would be beeeeeast!
great tacos!!!! Yum!!!
Seriously... the Cheesy Gordita Chrunch just vanished out of no where. BRING IT BACK!!!!
taco bell please send me a case of fire sauce as ever time i go to my local taco bell they tell me they are out cause it is so expensive i am tired of not gettting it and it is about to have me not eating at your stores.
The new Quad Steak Burrito is awesome!!
The Quad is SOOO good. Both the burrito and the quesadilla combined are the only thing that can fill me up! Uses a bunch of steak though. Three quads=1pan of steak...idk if the restaurants are losin money over it but it sure is delicious! 
me gusta taco bell
hahahahahahahahaha one of my bros we call him taco
Again: What group is behind the lawsuit? What Political Group is funding this. Follow the money! Ever heard of Hamburg Helper -- Taco Bell has good food -- Unless you are part of PETA, Environmental Movement and any of the other doomsayers!
Taco Bell, we want the return of the chili cheese burrito
Just think, if that Alabama lawyer had sued Wendy's over their chili, they'd probably just give him the finger. <):-)
are there TACO BELL in italy?
I LOOOOOOOVE Taco Bell!!! It should open until 4:30am! PLEASE!!
Thinking outside the bun isn't always good, I miss the Bell burger!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Q RICO LOVE TACO BELL ><

Dear Taco Bell, I am in a band called Roots In Stereo. After a long day at practice we love nothing more then to drive to our nearest Taco Bell and consume a couple of your hot delicious burritos. Even better then your burritos, we love to wash it down with some crisp, refreshing, flavorful Baja Blast Mountain Dew. So, I am going to cut to the chase. Please sponsor my band Roots In Stereo. We will do you proud! Love, RIS

1st of all I love Taco Bell but your Taco Bell in Hammond Louisiana (the one but the mall) sucks. Twice I have gone there at 1:40 (20 minutes before closing) and they tell me that they already cleaned up. Closing time is 2am right, so why don't they put everything up after 2????? I used to deliver next door to the Racetrac so that is the only place I could get something to eat at that time of the morning. I will never go back there. Why haven't ya'll opened one in Amite Louisiana? PLEASE open one there.

I was so hurt today when I went to the wonderful Taco Bell in Washington, NC and was told they no longer serve my all-time fave...the incomparable Cheesy Double Beef Burrito! I felt tears come to my eyes and my appetite was ruined. Why, dear TB, why would you stop serving it? Please reconsider, please, please.....
why did they get ride of the chezzy double beef and chicken enchalada burito 
what happened to the chives on the cheesy fiesta potatoes.
Why did you take away the CHEESY DOUBLE BEEF BURITO.???? Boycotting Taco bell until it is safely returned.......
You need to make Taco Bell dispensers. Ones that you can put in your favoite burrito and it just makes one in a ZAP.

Taco Bell In Burlington IA is THE BEEST!!!! I just love the service & food:)
I love Taco Bell, but I hate that the prices on the Why Pay More Menu keep going up. I got sticker shock the other day because I didn't look at the menu before I ordered. I usually order crunchy tacos and chicken soft tacos, and it seems like the prices go up every few months. Those happen to be two of the items at Taco Bell with the fewest calories, and they're what allow me to eat at Taco Bell and still lose weight.
BEEFY burrito...... 2 thumbs up from me

my mom and I tried the new beefy crunch burrito and it was so good. 
Taco Bell has so many choices I think they need a simple printable menu that I/people can keep in the car. I looked on the website but didn't see a simple plain printable menu with all their offerings. Sometimes when I get there I don't want to hold up the people behind me so I always get the same thing.

I received 4 coupons for free items from Bob Cavanaugh from Taco Bell after one store completely messed up my order. That was a bit of a surprise. So tonight we went to a different Taco Bell, the one on Day Dr. in Parma, Ohio and everything was free. The employees there were very nice and courteous too :-) Thanks for "fixing" the mix ups!

PRINTER INK FIASCO! I have a wireless HP printer/scanner/copier. I have to replace the ink cartridge (at $14.25 a pop!) about every 40 or 50 copies. Apparently there is a class action lawsuit against hp over this issue. However, customers who join the suit will only get about $6. This doesn't come close to covering the big bucks I have laid out for ink. HP WHAT ARE YOU WILLING TO DO ABOUT THIS??? YOU SHOULD EITHER FIX THE PROBLEM, OR GIVE ME A NEW PRINTER THAT DOESN'T COST A FORTUNE TO USE.
Listen up! Rob Riggle will be answering YOUR questions LIVE tomorrow during the HP ePrint Live event. HP's Liz Philips (@LizAtHP on Twitter) will be reporting live from NY and will choose a few and for a video response. Respond to this post with your question.

Made the mistake of opening up a bag of ketchup chips while making dinner!
I imagine the Stuffing ball recipe to be inclusive of all your favorite recipe ingredients & merely shaped into balls & baked in the oven for about 30 to 40 minutes?
Kary, our family LOVES your show. In our family, we have food allergies and sensitivities. I would just love it if for one episode, you could offer some tips for alternatives or substitutes (ie. ground flax for eggs, rice milk or soy milk for dairy, etc). We've tried some of our own substitutes in your recipes but it would be nice for it to come from a kitchen that has tested the substitutes/alternatives until perfect. Just a suggestion/idea. We adore you and your recipes!!!!
Hey Kary! I received an inbox message with regard to the Live Right Now group from Andy Phillips, Online Producer, Best Recipes Ever. The message was asking for my email address....I wanted to check to see if this was on the up and up. Thanks!
Just watched today's episode - you did a great job explaining the Japanese Hot Pot and it looks so simple and delicious! Can't wait to try it out sometime.
Can Kary (or anyone here) tell me what's the best way to store vegetables in the fridge? Thanks!
Hi kary, question for ya! i love the recipe for the fall off the bone bbq ribs that you broiled first with cajun spice then put in the slow cooker....thing is i broiled off way too much that won't fit in slow cooker. i plan on freezing them. when i go to cook tehm in the slow cooker would i defrost them totally first or can i put them in frozen/semi-frozen? thanx for any help <3
Hi Kary, Where do you go to buy the puff pastry? Thanks! <3
Question about cookware. I noticed you use a lot of stainless steel cookware. . Any one brand or type you can recommend?
I am looking for a good indian samosas recipe, one with a bit of spice to it. There are so many different recipies out there I am not sure what to try. Do you have any suggestions?
Do you have any good beef and bean burrito recipies?
It was to my amazement when i started seeing your show that it will become such an imp part of my daily routine that i dont miss a single show. I'm originally from India but your show has got me closer to Canada & i love u ,the way you talk infact everything!!!!!
how do i go about getting a recipe that was say 3 days ago.. im looking for the flat chicken that you did. thank you .
Hi Kary, do you know of a sugar free vanilla and choclate cupcake recipe and sugar free frosting recipe!!! All help would be great!!!
Sorry i have an other question. Kary the rainbow party cake .. I watched the show lastnight online and it did not show how you put the white icing ontop of the purple icing without the white and purple getting mixed together!!! If you can help me mast this that would be awesome!!! Thank you happy sunday!
Serving sizes and nutritional info...most recipes do not say if per serving / total amount made or per gram or ounce etc... I am wondering about the BEAN AND GRAIN salad? 
Thanks for the tip about using cream of tarter & vinegar to clean up pans when the grease has gone all sticky. I'd love to know why that happens. Anyway I tried baking soda & dish soap which required a lot of elbow grease. Yesterday I cooked something that made that sticky mess again so I finally had the opportunity to try your tip & it worked great! I made a paste of cream of tarter & vinegar and rubbed it on the pan, left it but only for a few minutes then put it in the dishpan and it washed up nicely! There were only a couple of sticky spots left so I did it again and it came up nice and clean. No elbow grease required. Thanks!!
My husband and I are helping out at a Soup Kitchen in February at a Church in our area, and need to make a Shepard's pie. I have never made it before. Do you have a good recipe for Shepard's Pie? I need to make a portion for 8 - 10 people. Thanks, Evelyn

Hey! May I have your recipe for beetroot and horseradish relish? Pretty please?
Have a question, I made your beetroot and apple relish, but after about 3 days it was covered in mold. The juices covered the shreds, and I used a fermeter. If I use whey could that help in the prevention of mold? This is the first time I've ever gotten mold on a ferment other than kombucha.
I perused your site and was unable to find one there, so I was wondering...Do you have a beloved recipe for lamb liver? 
I made the salmon cooked with cream recipe that you shared and it was FABULOUS! Everyone in my family liked it!
Road trip today! What are your favorite healthy snacks for the road that keep you off the truck stop junk and away from the fast food stops? Soaked and dehydrated nuts, raw milk cheese, sardines, fruit and coconut muffins always seem to make our list.
do you soak quinoa? since it's really a seed not a grain, i wonder if it needs to be soaked. 
What are your thoughts on hominy? I make traditional Pozole with a bone broth base and the hominy is an integral ingredient...not sure what I think of it nutritionally though. Your input would be welcome! :)
I am so excited, I just had to share...after tons of phone calls and searching, I have found a reliable and constant source of naturally raised chicken feet! They will order me a case at a time for a little over cost! WOOHOO!!! It would have been easier to score a kilo of brown heroin. Butchers acted like I was asking them for a golden egg, not chicken feet!
Question about fish sauce: We were in an Asian market, and discovered there are two kinds, the brown, thin sauce I'm used to, and a sauce made from actual ground up fish, with only water and salt added. They look to be nothing like each other! So can you please tell me which one I should be using?
Give up breakfast cereals and start the day with something nutrient-dense. Pictured here: roast grass-fed beef hash, farm eggs and pan-fried seckel pears with walnuts. Wash it all down with a mug of rooibos tea. What's your favorite nutrient-dense breakfast?
Any thoughts on Molasses? Would you say it was beneficial or healthy as a sweetener? Specifically for kids?
Jenny, will you weigh in on nitrate-free (or is it nitrite-free?) bacon? My CSA can't make it (USDA rules), so do I go with local + mandated chemicals or the Hormel "Natural Choice"? 
Does anyone have raw ice cream recipes that do not include eggs? I'm allergic to eggs. :(
HELP! I'm babysitting my friends squishy (baby) while he helps me move and decied to make crackers for him. All I have is chickpea flour will it still work for an at home nourishing teething biscut?
Looking to teach your kids about real food and nutrition? Food Renegade is now accepting enrollments for the spring session of Real Food Nutrition & Health, an online class teaching kids about wellness from a holistic, real food perspective.

I love these coconut milk popsicles by Divine Health - they're brimming with nutrient-dense fats, farm eggs and seem to be pretty low in added sugars for such a simple and kid-friendly treat.
As promised: rabbit stewed in Riesling with winter root vegetables and fresh herbs. Rabbit is rich in minerals including phosphorus and selenium, and it also offers a favorable omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio. Moreover, much like chickens for eggs, sustainability-minded real food lovers can enjoy raising rabbits even though they may be low on space.
We've been talking a lot about the importance of roe in a nutrient-dense diet as it's positively brimming with vitamins and good-for-you fatty acids. In this recipe for the traditional Greek dish: taramosalata, we combine roe with olive oil, lemon and smoked paprika.

Love this take on calorie counting: give it up and just eat real food. You don't need to count calories, fat, protein and carbs when you're eating wholesome, natural real foods. It really is simple: eat real and lead an active lifestyle.
A prominent vegan has since reevaluated his position on the omnivorous diet, pasture-/grass-based farming and why farming that excludes animals just isn't adequate.
My 5-year old just begged me to make fried chicken livers with New Mexico chilies for supper. Try your kids on nutrient-dense foods - you'll be surprised by how much they love it. 
Easy no-fuss supper tonight: choucroute garnie. I love how simple and utterly satisfying the combination of sauerkraut, good sausages and cured meats is. Cheers to the Alsatians.
We're thumbing our noses at the new USDA guidelines which call, again, for more vegetable oils while ignoring the benefits of good, healthy traditional fats like butter. I'm serving sole meuniere, drowning in butter, lemon and parsley.
The US Supreme Court refused to hear the case of former Tyson poultry farmer Alton Terry. Terry, after attempting to organize area farmers and complaining about Tyson's practices, lost his contract with the mega company. He eventually lost his farm too.
The USDA released the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans today: key points being 1) Enjoy your food, but eat less and avoid oversized portions; 2) Make half your plate fruits & veggies and switch to reduced fat milk, and 3) Watch out for sodium on labels and reduce sugary beverages.

Have you seen it? Our olive oil ice cream with blood oranges was featured on WebMD via my favorite recipe source: Foodily. If you haven't already tried it, please do - it's absolutely lovely with fresh cream, orchard blossom honey and blood oranges which are coming into season right about now. 
Brimming with roasted berries, sweetened by a touch of honey, this creamy custard-like flaugnarde is a simple, nourishing dessert. In a fit of nature's loveliness, berries are rich in lutein - a fat-soluble antioxidant - which makes this marriage of berries, farm eggs and fresh cream not only taste heavenly, but also that much better for you.

After yesterday's disappointing news about Colorado's Department of Health crackdown on small grass-based ranches and raw dairies, I'm excited to share this news with you: the Colorado governor elect John W. Hickenlooper will be serving grass-fed beef from one of my favorite ranches at his inaugural dinner. He found Diamond F on a trip through the Crested Butte Farmers Market.

Advice from my 5-year old: We should eat more fermented vegetables, fruits, fish eggs, salmon and nuts and seeds. Okay, mom?
I love a good frittata for breakfast or lunch - a lovely way to use up choline-rich eggs and leftover vegetables. This frittata makes use of two of my favorite winter vegetables: potatoes and Swiss chard. Sometimes I'll serve it with a touch of fermented hot chili sauce (http://nourishedkitchen.com/fermented-hot-chili-sauce-recipe/). What are your favorite additions to the frittata?

Colorado Public Health is cracking down on raw milk producers in the state and it has me deeply unnerved. More disturbing yet, is that when the CDPH does go after a raw milk producer, they seem to use that as an excuse to take other products too - grass-fed meats, for example.

After suffering significant financial losses due to losing organic status, this wheat and oat farmer files a lawsuit. Turns out his organic crops were contaminated by GMO canola from neighboring farms. Instead of supporting the farmer's rights to keep his fields free of contaminants, the agriculture minister finds fault with organic standards urging for "coexistence" of GM contaminants in certified organic crops.

As many of you know, after a long and hard battle, genetically engineered alfalfa was deregulated by the USDA yesterday - opening a dangerous precedent that is likely to inhibit your ability to access truly organic dairy and beef.
Finally ordered black olives for salt-curing. Can't wait to share the process with you real food lovers out there. In the mean time, see how we cured green olives.
Maybe it's the long and drawn out winter that has me thinking about summer Barbecues. I'm not alone either - Jenn from The Leftover Queen developed this lovely recipe for pasture-raised pork with apple barbecue sauce. 
Everyone seems to be coughing and sneezing around us, but we're ready. Here's our three-step method for fighting the flu without the medicine cabinet.
All right real food lovers, I need your input. I have avoided including nutrition information Nourished Kitchen becausee 1) it's time-consuming, 2) nutrition calculators fail to account for differences among grass-fed/conventional foods and 3) our focus should be on real food and ingredients rather than counting calories, carbs, protein and fat. It's as much your blog as mine. Do you want nutri
Rich with the flavor of smoked paprika, here's a nourishing soup that brightens the cold and solemn days of mid-winter.

What happens when you're busy blogging and you forget you're milling flour.
just got a delightful recipe from WebMD--the source? The Nourished Kitchen!! I should have known when the recipe created something delightful out of real food. Spiced Apple Sauce. Looking forward to making it, and looking forward to TNK becoming more and more mainstream!
I love the multitude of colors offered in carrots - purple, yellow, red, orange, white. They're lovely. These carrots are destined for rabbit with riesling - a recipe Nourished Kitchen's European readers have been asking after for some time.
I made a pot of turkey broth yesterday. After removing the meat and pulling out the long bones, which may splinter, I was left with a pile of shredded meat and crumbled bone bits. Is there any reason you can think of to NOT give this to the cats to eat? The bones are clearly not going to splinter, since they're all crumbled up into bits. I've got a full half gallon of it and would hate to waste it.
I recently made some fermented corn relish. If you hear of anyone else making it, feel free to share. Mine came out tasty, but a little salty.
Hi Jenny! Just wanted to tell you that the orange beef recipe from Simple Dinners & Healthy Meal Plan was sooo delicious! I just took the leftovers out of the fridge and it tastes even better today (even cold). Think I'll make the roast lemon chicken with olives tonight. 
Just got rabbits via my good hunting dog yesterday so I'm looking forward to trying the Rabbit and Riesling recipe tonight!
Does anyone know of a real food pyramid that I can use for our homeschool lessons the USDA one makes me ill just looking at it.... all those grains!!
this may be a dumb question, but is it better to have some of the organ meats (heart, liver..not sure what else?) ground in with the ground beef, or is it better to just use the liver as a dish. Last year we ended up with about 60lbs of ground beef when we purchased our side, and I'm trying to figure out how to make it the most nutritious. 
Trying to buy the Healthy Meal Plan from your site but the advertised coupon code RFM20 doesn't work?

"The Miracle of Giving" Satu hal yang membuat orang merasa berarti adalah adanya perhatian dan kasih sayang dari sesama. banyak orang yang sangat membutuhkan perhatian kita di dunia ini, tapi banyak dari kita yang tidak peduli dan tidak mengerti apa arti dari saling berbagi. Padahal, kalau saja kita senang berbagi, maka dengan sendirinya kita tahu arti berbagi itu sendiri. Pengalamanku, dengan berbagi aku merasa menjadi orang yang lebih berguna bagi orang lain dan itu menjadi kebanggaan bagi diriku sendiri. Aku sayang kepada anak-anak, aku sering sedih melihat anak-anak yang memulung sampah di pinggir jalan, mengamen, atau pun yang menjadi tukang semir sepatu. Kusisihkan sebagian uang jajanku untuk membeli coklat yang aku bagikan kepada mereka. Dari hatiku, aku merasa senang sekali melihat senyum dan tawa mereka saat kuberi sebatang coklat. Aku berpikir bahwa apa yang mereka kerjakan bukanlah kewajiban mereka sebagai seorang anak. Seharusnya mereka masih senang bersekolah dan bermain bersama teman-teman mereka. Pekerjaan yang mereka kerjakan menurutku sanga tidak layak. Cita-citaku nanti adalah suatu saat akan aku dirikan panti asuhan dan sekolah gratis bagi mereka yang memang tidak punya orang tua dan tempat tinggal. Agar mereka bisa merasakan indahnya menjadi anak-anak. Karena belum waktunya bagi mereka untuk mencari makan sendiri. Semoga cita-citaku kelak dapat terwujud, sehingga semakin berkuranglah anak-anak yang tinggal di jalana ataupun di kolong jembatan. Amiinnn..
""THE MIRACLE OF GIVING"" Persahabatan, suatu ikatan yang mungkin sangat penting bagi seseorang, dimana dua atau lebih orang saling mengisi baik suka maupun duka. Semua orang pasti membutuhkan sahabat, sebab tidak ada satu orang manusiapun di dunia ini yang bisa hidup tanpa bantuan orang lain. Semua masalah di kehidupan ini hanya bisa tercurah kepada sahabat, walaupun orangtua sangat dekat kepada kita, tapi mungkin hanya sahabatlah yang bisa mendengarkan, bahkan mengatasi semua masalah kita. Senang jika melihat sahabat bisa tertawa bersama-sama terbuai akan lantunan suara-suara yang enak didengar ditelinga. Tak ada satupun unek-unek yang tersembunyi di hati jika ada sahabat. Senang, sedih, suka, duka semuanya pasti ada, tetapi jika ada sahabat mungkin semuanya itu akan menjadi suka, suka yang paling mendalam di hati. Tapi, bagaimana jika sahabat pergi meninggalkan kita? Huftz, sedihnya bukan main. Apalagi jika sahabat itu sudah sangat dekat kepada kita. Tak pernah kita meninggalkannya walau seharipun. Dia selalu ada di dalam setiap suka maupun duka. Seperti di tahun baru ini, aku bisa berkumpul kembali dengan sahabat-sahabatku di SMA dulu. Kami semua sangat menyayangi dan mengerti satu sama lain. Tapi, waktu jugalah yang memisahkan kami semua, karena kami harus meneruskan jenjang pendidikan kami. Walau ada banyak rasa sedih tersirat di dalam dada, tapi apa boleh buat, waktu sangat kejam, sehingga dia tak membiarkan kami selalu bersama setiap saat. Di tahun baru ini, kami berkumpul kembali ke kampung halaman, dan bisa juga dibilang reunian. Kami berumpul bersama di rumahku, saling berbagi cerita kehidupan yang telah kami rasakan masing-masing di negeri orang. Bunyi tertawa, wajah cemas, wajah gembira, hingga air mata ikut membumbui acara reunian kami ini. Dulu, kami selalu bersama sampai-sampai di kala ujian pun kami bekerja sama. Dan sekarang waktunya mengulangi semuanya itu dengan berkumpul bersama lagi. Sangat senang rasanya bisa melihat wajah-wajah mereka lagi, walaupun sudah sedikit berubah dari yang dulu. Suara tertawa mereka satu-persatu yang khas, gaya bicara yang blak-blakan, hingga sifat dan karakter mereka yang mungkin tidak bisa diubah lagi. Hmm.. senang dan senang. Apalagi kami berkunjung kembali ke sekolah tercinta kami dulu, walaupun sekolah itu sudah di renovasi, hingga kelas kami yang dulu kami tempati untuk belajar sudah lekang tak tersisa. Dan yang bisa kami lakukan hanya berfoto-foto di depan sekolah kami tempat menanam sejuta harapan, impian dan juga kenangan. Namun, kebersamaan sejenak itu ternyata luput juga, yah karena waktu juga. Bagaimanapun waktu terus berputar, tidak akan pernah berhenti apalagi mundur. Kami semua kembali ke rutinitas semula, kembali mencari sesuap nasi untuk sejengkal perut di negeri orang. Tapi, kebahagiaan sejenak itu tak akan pernah kulupakan seumur hidupku. I LOVE YOU MY FRIEND

#THE MIRACLE OF GIVING# Suatu hari aku pulang dari kerja kehausan kecapean, dikantong cuman ada 2 ribu perak. Hati ini pengen beli makanan buat jajan, tapi tiba-tiba datang orang2 dr panitia masjid untuk minta sumbangan. Ku kasih aja 2 rb itu. Awalnya sedih sih duit tinggal satu2nya kini g da. Palagi kondisi lagi kritis banget. Tapi aku belajar untuk iklas, ku pikir kalaupun g iklas tetep aja g kembali malah g dpt pahalanya. Akhirnya q lupakan duit itu dan aku makan nasi aja ketimbang nahan lapar. Setelah makan aku bengong sendiri di belakang rumahku. Kebetulan belakang rumahku sungai. Sungainya pas saat itu lagi surut. Eh asik-asik bengong aku lihat ada duit 10rb. Malah kelihatannya masih utuh kaya baru aja kecebur. G tau deh duit siapa. Aku raih tanganku untuk mengambilnya. Alhamdulilah.... aku dapat 10rb. mungkin ini rezeki dr Tuhan pikirku. Gantiannya aku nyumbang 2 rb td. Aku percaya jika kita memberi dengan iklas walaupun sedikit pasti Tuhan akan memberikan gantinya yang lebih banyak. Dan itu sudah ku buktikan sendiri.. sejak saat itu aku percaya dengan adanya keajaiban dr sedekah.. sedekah juga yang bisa membuat kita menjadi kaya harta, kaya hati, dan kaya segala-galanya. . Sejak saat itu walaupun duitku lagi krisis aku selalu berusaha sedekah jika ada orang minta2. Karna jika kita semakin g da duit semakin kita pelit malah Tuhan akan semakin mengunci pintu rezeki kita rapat2. Ya.. aku percaya rezeki mudah datang jika kita mau berbagi... Tuhan selalu adil..
" Tango Spread Miracles " The Miracle Of Giving Terkadang kita takjub dengan balasan yang diberikan oleh seseorang kepada kita untuk sebuah pemberian yang menurut kita pada saat melakukannya adalah biasa-biasa saja . Namun balasan ( yang sebenarnya tidak kita harapkan ) yang diberikan dahsyatnya luar biasa, karena balasan itu bisa datang dari orang yang diberi maupun dari-Nya yang tidak kita ketahui apakah itu. Apalagi ketika melakukannya dengan penuh keikhlasan, kerendahan hati, penuh cinta dan kasih. Pemberian tidak hanya terfokus di luar lingkungan kita saja dan pemberian juga tidak hanya berupa materi yang berbentuk uang dan barang, tetapi pemberian yang terbaik adalah sebuah pengorbanan yang tulus dari dalam hati. Memberikan pengorbanan tidak semudah membalikkan telapak tangan. Seperti kasih Ibu yang tidak pernah putus kepada anaknya walau dengan sepenuh jiwa dan raga telah ia berikan. Ibu tidak pernah mengharapkan balasan, begitu juga aku terhadap anakku Syila. Aku selalu berusaha memberikan Syila yang terbaik, menjaga, merawat dan melindunginya dari apapun. Dan aku tidak pernah mengharapkan apapun walau sebesar biji Zarahpun. Tetapi tuhan berkata lain, ini lah yang dinamakan The Miracle Of Giving . Berawal dari pengalamanku sendiri, dimana kami orangtua yang keuangannya hanya pas-pasan saja. Dengan hadirnya rezeki dari-Nya yakni berupa anakku Syila, kami terfikir apakah kami bisa membesarkan Syila seperti anak-anak lainnya. Aku hanya bisa pasrah dan berdoa. Segala materi atau apa saja yang aku punya dan waktuku aku korbankan untuk anakku tercinta. Aku akan selalu lakukan yang terbaik untuknya dan aku tidak berharap balasan walau sebesar bakteripun. Tapi Tuhan berkata lain, dengan seiring berjalannya waktu dan tanpa kuduga Tuhan membalasnya. Semua kebutuhan Syila baik susu, popok, baju, obat, vitamin dan kebutuhan Syila lainnya terpenuhi dengan mulus tanpa ada halangan yang berarti. Padahal kalau dihitung-hitung penghasilan kami dengan kebutuhan Syila begitu jauh selisihnya. Dan ini tidak berakhir sampai di situ saja, Tuhan sangat mengerti pemberian dan pengorbanan umatnya. Kami juga sebagai orangtua sangat heran dimana kebutuhan kami juga sangat terpenuhi jauh dari kehidupan kami sebelumnya baik materi maupun non materi, terima kasih Tuhan. Aku selalu berdoa agar Syila menjadi tumbuh dewasa dengan segala cita-citanya dan dalam hatiku selalu ingin melihat senyum indah dari bibir kecilnya sampai kapanpun. Semoga kasih dan sayangku ini sangat bermanfaat baginya walau hanya sekecil apapun. Aku sangat tidak berharap kasihku ini berbalas darinya, walau hanya sebesar biji Zarahpun. Duhai anakku tempuh harapanmu, gapai cita-citamu, genggam duniamu, buang rintanganmu, terjang ombakmu, tundukkan duniamu, taatlah kepada Tuhanmu, dan aku berjanji kasih sayangku akan selalu mendampingimu sampai tiba ajalku. Terima kasih Tuhan And the miracle of giving for me from God is you, my child.. I will always love u ^_^
Jika kebahagiaan kita pahami sebagai sebuah pilihan, maka modal pertama untuk mendapatkannya tentulah kemauan untuk bahagia. Tanpa komitmen, kesulitan dan persoalan mudah sekali menghancurkan sebuah keluarga. Setelah membangun komitmen bersama kearah kebahagiaan, modal berikutnya adalah kemampuan untuk menyatukan kekuatan dari masing-masing pihak. Untuk itu mulailah melihat sisi positif masing-masing pihak. Tanpa kesediaan melihat hal-hal positif pada keluarga kita, maka tidak ada sinergi yang tulus kearah kebahagiaan. Sikap positif pada keluarga dapat ditunjukkan dan ditumbuhkan sehari-hari. Mulai kebiasaan memberikan pujian dan apresiasi yang tulus pada keluarga. Setelah komitmen dan sikap positif pada keluarga, pondasi selanjutnya adalah kebersamaan. Luangkan waktu untuk bersama. Bermain bersama, bekerja bersama, berlibur bersama. Kebersamaan adalah momen saling membagi. Ia akan menumbuhkan perasaan saling membutuhkan dan saling melengkapi. Sebuah hubungan yang didasarkan pada perasaa saling membutuhkan secara positif akan menjadi awal yang baik bagi sebuah kebahagiaan bersama. Komunikasi adalah sebuah proses pertukaran makna guna melahirkan pengertian bersama. Komunikasi akan melahirkan pertautan perasaan atau emosi yang kuat antara mereka yang terlibat. Karena itu, guna meraih kebahagiaan keluarga, sebaiknya komunikasikan berbagai peristiwa penting yang dialami agar masing-masing pihak semakin mengenal dunia masing-masing dan merasa dilibatkan dalam dunia satu sama lain. Meyakini falsafah hidup yang sama semakin memperkuat tali batin keluarga. Menjalani bersama ritual agama membuat harmoni keluarga terjalin lebih hangat dan dalam. Misalnya saja melaksananakan ibadah bersama. Dengan kegiatan seperti itu akan membantu menyadari hal-hal yang lebih mendasar dalam hidup. Sebuah kecerdasan spiritual yang jelas sangat berpengaruh pada kesanggupan orang untuk bahagia. Bermain adalah ciri khas manusia. Sediakan waktu untuk bermain, bersantai, rileks dan humor. Melalui permainan kita membagi perasaan yang kita miliki dengan sesama anggota keluaraga. Permainan melahirkan tawa canda, hal sederhana namun teramat penting untuk kebahagiaan. Fleksibel dalam berbagi peran dan tanggungjawab. Kadang bapak yang menemani anak, kadang ibu yang sibuk diluar. Berbagi peran dan tanggungjawab membuat masing-masing pihak semakin merasa sebagai satu kesatuan. Banyak masalah dalam keluarga timbul hanya karena enggan berbagi tugas. Bapak merasa tidak perlu menangani pekerjaan dapur dan anak, sementara beban sang ibu begitu banyak. Untuk memperkuat pondasi bagi kebersamaan keluarga, sebaiknya carilah kegemaran dan kepentingan yang sama antar setiap anggota keluarga. Lalu rencanakan untuk menjalani kegemaran bersama itu. Merencanakan, menjalankan, dan mengevaluasi kegiatan itu secara bersama semakin menguatkan kesatuan keluarga. Secara bersama melayani dan menolong orang lain yang kurang mampu atau tertimpa bencana akan membri pengaruh positif. Pengalaman itu akan membantu masing-masing pihak semakin bersyukur berada dalam kondisi yang lebih baik. Secara bersama menolong orang lain, membuat kebersamaan itu semakin bermakna. Tidak ada satu pun keluarga yang terbebas dari problematika. Jika kesulitan itu datang, dan kita merasa tidak mampu mengatasinya sendiri, jangan ragu meminta bantuan dari pihak yang lebih ahli. Kekuatan dan kemampuan kita menghadapi hidup tidak akan dikurangi sedikitpun ketika kita meminta bantuan pihak lain.

"My 2010 Unforgettable Moment" Akhir Juli 2010 adalah saat2 yang tak kan pernah kulupakan seumur hidupku bersama sahabat2 terbaikku. Bali adalah salah satu mimpi ku selama ini. Mungkin sebagian orang sudah sering ke Bali. Tapi mimpi menjadi kenyataan ini kan menjadi kenangan terindah untukku. 5 hari menghabiskan waktu bersama sahabat menikmati liburan ke Bali. Tanpa persiapan apapun, kita ber 4 nekad liburan ke Bali. Untuk hotel pun baru kita booking saat sudah nyampe di bandara Ngurah Rai. Dan selama di Bali kita tak butuh jasa biro atau tour guide, menyelusuri Bali sambil me rental motor , benar2 pengen mengulanginya kembali. Dari Pantai Kuta hanya dengan motor kita berhasil sampai ke Tanah Lot , Sukawati dan Ubud. Ini adalah foto di salah satu Pura di Ubud. Berlagak seperti gadis2 Bali , kita mengabadikan moment tersebut. Dan selama liburan inilah ,aku bisa lebih mengenal dekat sifat masing2 sahabatku. Kompak dan berani mungkin inilah tema liburan kami ke Bali. ingin mengulang kembali, dan mudah2an suatu saat bisa terwujud lagi...:)
"My Unforgettable Moment" ini foto kenangan waktu masa-masa emasnya regu pramuka RAJAWALI SMP NEGERI 145. Mereka dipertemukan saat ajang pemilihan regu inti, minggu demi minggu, dari beratus2 siswa hanya ada 2 orang yg bertahan, 2 orang tersebut mencari orang2 yg berminat untuk gabung keregu inti, alhamdulillah ada yg mau. dan setelah mereka menjadi regu inti, inilah kisah mereka: Pada kelas 1 SMP regu ini sangat sangat menunjukkan semangatnya untuk menjadi regu terbaik, mereka sudah menunjukkannya. Kelas 2 pun tiba, mereka semakin menunjukkan kekuatannya dan kekompakkannya dalam ajang lomba, alhamdulillah mereka memborong piala2 terbaik. pada kelas 3 mereka vakum untuk ujian, dan yg sangat membanggakan mereka lulus. setelah lulus, mereka tidak lupa dengan tempat asal mereka jadi seperti sekarang dan mereka mengajar adik juniornya untuk membuktikan mereka bukan kacang yg lupa dengan kulitnya. Slogan kami 'KAMI BUKAN PECUNDANG YANG SERING PUTUS ASA, TAPI KAMI ADALAH BURUNG RAJAWALI YG SIAP MENUNJUKKAN CAKARNYA' !
Buah jatuh tidak jauh dari pohonnya. Itulah saya. Ibu saya seorang perawat, dan sayapun mengikuti jejaknya. Ibu orang yang saya sayangi. Tahun baru ini saya kebagian jaga malam. Berarti saya merayakan pergantian tahun di tempat kerja. Sebelum saya membaca FB Tango yang mengadakan THE MIRACLE OF GIVING, saya sudah berfikir, pada malam tahun baru kali ini, saya ingin memberikan sesuatu kepada penunggu pasien di tempat saya bekerja, tetapi saya masih bingung, mau memberikan mereka apa. Tetapi ketika saya membaca FB tanggo, saya jadi punya ide. Akhirnya saya membuat bingkisan tango yang dikemas dalam plastik bercorak dan saya ikat dengan pita supaya kelihatan lebih cantik. Walaupun isi tanggonya tidak banyak, tetapi kelihatannya bingkisan itu jadi menarik. Malam itu saya berkeliling ke kamar pasien, dan saya memberikan bingkisan tango itu pada penunggu pasien yang masih terjaga. Mereka kelihatan sangat senang sekali menerima bingkisan tango itu. Disaat orang lain diluar bersuka ria, para penunggu pasienpun jadi bersuka ria dengan bingkisan tango yang saya berikan. Mereka katakan bahwa makan tango di malam pergantian tahun baru tidak kalah serunya. Melihat mereka gembira, ada kepuasan tersendiri buat saya pribadi. Saya jadi ingin memberikan bingkisan ini menjadikan suatu kebiasaan.
"THE MIRACLE OF GIVING" Sehat itu adalah hal yang terpenting.. tetapi masih banyak orang yang meremehkan kesehatan,,meskipun mereka saat sakit baru menyadari kesalahan mereka dan berusaha untuk tidak melanggar hukum kesehatan.. anak ini menjadi salah atu contoh ketidak pekaan terhadap penyakitnya,, saat dia masuk ke RS dia adalah manusia yang tidak punya semangat hidup,yang sama sekali tidak bisa melakukan apa2,,dan dia hanya pasrah samakehidupannya,,,dan itu banyak dialami oleh beberapa pasien yang putus ada dan tidak punya semangat hidup..saya sebagai perawat yang ingin mengabdikan diri dalam pelayanan kepada pasien dan memberikan yang terbaik untuk kesembuhan pasien akan berusaha membuat mereka bangkit dan tetap semangat untuk kesembuhan mereka salah satu yang kurang dimiliki pasien adalah Tender,Loving,Care da inilah misi saya memberikan kesabaran,mencintai dan merawat mereka dengan penuh kepedulian setiap hari,dan dengan ini mereka akan menunjukkan sebuah tanda keajaiban dalam diri mereka,,mereka akan mulai tersenyum,akan mulai membuka diri ,menjadi sahabat dan peduli ama diri mereka sendiri dan semangat untuk sembuh akan menjadi keinginan mereka selain TLC(tender,Loving and Care) saya juga memberikan mereka SENYUM,SAPA,SEMANGATdan SPIRIT, hasilnya mereka akan memiliki pengaharapan bahwa hidup itu indah dan semboyan mereka adalahHATI YANG GEMBIRA ADALAH OBAT YANG MANJUR. anak ini menjalani ini semua haru demi hari dan dia berjuang melawan penyakitnya,,dan dengan cinta,perhatian dan semangat dan semua yang saya ajarkan kepadanya membuat dia bisa bertahan dan bisa pindah dari ICU ke ruangan biasa,,hal yang kecil yang saya berikan mungkin bagi sebagian orang tidaklah bermanfaat apapun tapi bagi orang yang lemah ini akan menjadi kekuatan yang memberikan mereka suatu keajaiban yang sangat berharga dan yang tak terlupakan. berikanlah TLC dan senyum anda pada orang yang membutuhkan maka anda akan melihat sinar kebahagian dimata mereka saat melihat senyum dan perhatian serta cinta anda.dan itulah yang saya lakukan selama saya bekerja menjadi suatu saluran berkat bagi orang lain.
THE MIRACLE OF GIVING Pencerahan terkadang datang di saat yang tak terduga, begitulah yang telah kami alami sebagai siswa SMA Negeri 1 Palembang. Kisah ini dimulai pada awal Agustus 2008 dimana teman kami Ledya, sedang ber-ulang tahun ke-17. Sweet Seventeen ! Memang terasa manis, semanis pengalaman yang kami dapatkan. Layaknya anak muda yang penuh semangat, di hari itu kami habiskan uang hanya untuk membeli beberapa telur dan tepung terigu. Bukannya mau membuat kue, melainkan membuat adonan di tubuh teman kami. Satu telur mendarat tepat di atas rambut lurusnya, disusul telur lainnya yang secara cepat membombardir tubuh kecilnya. Tepung terigu menjadi santapan pendamping yang tak kalah penting, berhamburan lengket menempel disekujur tubuh menyatu bersama telur yang mulai menebar bau tak sedap. Ditengah pesta pora kemeriahan perang, kami mendapat teguran keras dari beberapa guru. Secara mendadak pesta yang meriah berubah menjadi suasana kuburan, sepi, sunyi, senyap, hanya ceramah yang terdengar menyindir tingkah nakal kami. Ditengah kerumunan nasehat yang mengelilingi telinga, kami merasa sangat bersalah. Telur dan tepung yang begitu berharga kami sia-siakan hanya untuk permainan. Masih banyak orang diluar sana yang kelaparan kekurangan gizi, sedangkan kami hanya bermain dengan gizi tersebut. Pesta berakhir, kami pulang dengan muka penuh dosa dan tertitip hukuman untuk membawa 3 kg telur dan 1 kg tepung tiap orang esok harinya. Semua sudah terkumpul, ada 40 lebih kantong plastik hitam berisi telur dan tepung yang terlihat seperti mini gudang logistik. Semua diangkut kedalam mobil lalu diantar ketempat yang tak kami duga sebelumnya. Satu per satu diturunkan dari mobil menuju sebuah rumah yang lumayan besar dengan suasana taman kosong yang dipenuhi anak kecil bermain. Tempat yang sederhana dengan permainan seadanya. Disinilah tempat kami berbagi, panti asuhan Al-Ikhlas di pinggir kota Palembang. Senyum anak-anak itu lah yang semakin menyemangati kami untuk selalu berbagi. Berbagi dari hal kecil yang kadang kala kita anggap remeh dan kita sia-siakan, namun sangat besar dihadapan orang-orang kecil. Keajaiban berbagi inilah yang menuntun kami untuk selalu menatap kebawah, membuka pintu menuju jalan baru, jalan yang menunjukkan betapa berharganya nilai kebersamaan dengan sesama. Terima kasih Tuhan telah memberi saya dan teman-teman pengalaman ini.

"THE MIRACLE OF GIVING" Buku untuk Masa Depan Berawal dari kebiasaanku membeli buku dan majalah yang kemudian setelah selesai aku baca,aku hanya menumpuknya dirumah.Lama-kelamaan buku & majalah itu semakin menumpuk.Orangtua sudah memperingatkanku kalau aku tidak segera merapikan tumpukan buku & majalah itu,maka mereka akan membuangnya..Duuh rasanya sayang kalau harus aku buang,kalau dijualpun hasilnya juga tidak seberapa.Tiba-tiba sahabatku punya ide untuk menyumbangkan buku&majalah bekas tersebut.Good idea pikirku saat itu,kalau diberikan kepada orang lain mungkin buku-buku itu jauh lebih bermanfaat.Akhirnya kami menghubungi teman-teman kuliah yang lain untuk membantu kami merealisasikan keinginan kami menyumbangkan buku bekas.Ternyata, teman-teman sangat antusias bahkan mereka turut membantu menyumbangkan buku-buku bekas milik mereka. Kami begitu senang karena barang-barang yang tadinya kami anggap sudah tidak berguna,kalau diberikan kepada orang yang tepat bisa menjadi barang yang begitu berharga. Sejak saat itu saya dan teman-teman sepakat untuk melanjutkan aktivitas ini,kami mengelolanya dengan lebih baik dan terorganisir. Akhirnya banyak donatur yang turut menyumbang tidak hanya buku bekas tapi juga buku baru. Sasaran pemberian buku pun mulai melebar tidak hanya panti asuhan tapi juga rumah singgah,kampung-kampung yang belum memiliki perpustakaan,warga dikolong jembatan,dan juga sekolah-sekolah yang kurang mampu.Semakin lama komunitas kami semakin berkembang hingga akhirnya kami memberi nama komunitas ini "Books For Hope".Kami berharap komunitas ini semakin berkembang seiring dengan meningkatnya kesadaran masyarakat akan pentingnya membaca dan juga seiring dengan meningkatnya kepedulian terhadap sesama.
"THE MIRACLE OF GIVING" Keajaiban akan terjadi ketika kita mampu meberikan contoh yang baik terhadap orang yang ada di sekitar kita Tetangga disini kebanyakan orang-orang yang sibuk. Suami Istri kerja semua sehingga mereka cenderung cuek dan kurang peduli terhadap lingkungan tempat tinggalnya. Miris rasanya jika melihat kondisi lingkungan sekitar sini yang kurang terawat. Misalnya : sampah yang menumpuk di selokan dibiarkan begitu saja otomatis air menjadi tergenang dan tidak mengalir, rumah yang tidak terurus sehingga terlihat sedikit kumuh, dan masih banyak hal lainnya. Awalnya saya sedikit bingung melihat kondisi ini karena kebanyakan dari tetangga saya usianya jauh lebih tua daripada saya, maklum saya dan suami merupakan keluarga muda. Menurut pengalaman saya, biasanya orang yang lebih tua tidak akan memperhatikan jika yang muda memberikan saran. Hal ini, pernah saya lakukan ketika memberitahu tetangga depan rumah membiarkan drum air terbuka di halaman rumahnya karena hal tersebut akan menjadikan sarang nyamuk apalagi kondisi sekarang yang terus menerus hujan. Hasilnya, saya malah diceramahi balik dan ujung-ujungnya saya sendiri yang sakit hati. Daripada saya capek tidak ada hasil lebih baik saya bertindak real. Saya hanya ingin membuktikan sebuah kebenaran dari suatu ungkapan yang pernah saya baca di buku yaitu Lebih baik satu kali contoh daripada lima kali nasihat. Bersama suami dan anak saya yang masih berusia dua tahun, kita bikin gebrakan potisasi (menaruh tanaman pot di area pinggir jalan depan rumah kami. Saya buat teras rumah saya tertata dengan berbagai tanaman hijau sehingga terlihat lebih asri dari biasanya. Saya juga ajak anak saya yang masih berumur 2 tahun menyiram tanaman di depan rumah. Tidak itu, saya dan suami selalu kompak memeriksa selokan 3 hari sekali, tak tangung-tanggung meskipun saya wanita, saya rela membersihkan selokan jika dipenuhi oleh sampah dengan cangkul. Berat banget, tangan sampe panas rasanya tapi demi perubahan lingkungan yang saya harapkan. Saya sekeluarga harus tetap semangat. Namun apa yang terjadi? Ternyata tidak BUTUH waktu yang lamauntuk menularkan virus tersebut. Sebuah KEAJAIBAN terjadi. Virus kebaikan yang saya sebar akan kepedulian terhadap lingkungan sekitar tempat tinggal telah menjangkiti tetangga-tetangga saya, satu persatu mereka mulai meniru kebiasaan saya dan suami, mereka menghiasi rumah mereka dengan taman, menaruh tanaman pot di pinggir jalan area depan rumah mereka masing-masing, bahkan kesadaran mereka untuk menjaga saluran pembuangan (selokan) di depan rumahnya masing-masing telah muncul. Indahnya bisa menularkan kebiasaan baik kepada orang-orang disini. Memberikan/mengajarkan kebiasaan menjaga dan merawat lingkungan bukanlah proses yang instan oleh karena itu lakukan semuanya mulai dari hal yang kecil, lakukan dengan cara yang menyenangkan dan lakukan terus-menerus. Disitulah nanti keajaiban akan dapat kita lihat.
THE MIRACLE OF GIVING "JANGAN TANYA APA YANG NEGARA SUDAH BERIKAN PADAMU TAPI TANYALAH APA YANG SUDAH KAMU BERIKAN UNTUK NEGARA MU" Budaya tradisional indonesia adalah salah satu kekayaan bangsa yang harus dijaga kelestariannya dari ancaman kepunahan dan pengaruh buruk budaya luar.Makin maraknya pengaruh-pengaruh budaya luar membuat tunas-tunas bangsa menjadi tidak mengenal budaya indonesia. Oleh karena itu saya sebagai generasi muda yang mempunyai hobi menari tarian tradisional..saya memberikan sesuatu apa yang saya punya untuk anak-anak berbakat yang kurang mampu dengan harapan mereka dapat mengaktualisasikan bakat mereka dan menanamkan rasa cinta terhadap kebudayaan indonesia. Dan saat mereka sudah dewasa mereka akan membagikan kembali pengenalan budaya melalui pelatihan tari gratis untuk anak-anak kurang mampu dengan demikian saling berkelanjutan generasi ke generasi berikutnya dan tujuan yang baik ini menjadi satu Kebiasaan..untuk tidak pelit berbagi keahlian pada orang lain....Kalau bukan kita sebagai generasi muda siapa lagi yang akan melestarikan budaya indonesia....
Saya seorang istri berumur 21 tahun.saya sudah berkeluarga dan mempunyai seorang anak.mempunyai seorang anak merupakan anugrah terindah dalam hidup saya,melengkapi keluarga kecil saya dengan senyum dan tangisannya,hari hari saya begitu indah karenanya Namun betapa mirisnya hati saya jika saya melihat nasib anak-anak diluar sana. Ketika seorang anak di eksploitasi bekerja padahal dia belum cukup umur ,yang seharusnya seusia mereka bermain,belajar dan bereksperimen bahkan mencari jati diri,malah sibuk dengan hal yang seharusnya tidak ia lakukan di usianya,jika terus seperti ini bagaimana ya nasib sebuah negara kedepannya?padahal banyak yang bilang kalau anak adalah tunas bangsa,generasi muda yang akan selanjutnya meneruskan perjuangan bahkan memimpin sebuah negara.bagaimana ingin memimpin jika semasa kecilnya disibukkan dengan hal yang seharusnya tidak ia lakukan Dalam kasus seperti ini alangkah baik nya jika kita memberikan penyuluhan pada setiap orang tua,agar hal diatas tidak terjadi,misalnya memberikan wawasan tentang dampak dan akibat nya bagi anak mereka jika hal ini terjadi,memberikan pengertian bahwa anak anak di bawah umur tidak boleh bekerja justru di usia nya yang dini mereka harus belajar menuntut ilmu untuk masa depannya kelak,memberikan hak-hak mereka,maka mereka akan menjalankan kewajibanya sebagai anak.Dan untuk anak nya seharusnya juga di berikan pengertian tentang hak dan kewajibanya,memberikan pengentahuan yang mana yang baik dan buruknya semoga artikel ini dapat bermanfaat untuk kita semua.SO guys if you want to save the world save the children first !!!

"THE MIRACLE OF GIVING" Indahnya kebersamaan mungkin itu yang tergambar dalam benakku di kala itu.. suatu kelas yang mungkin muridnya tidak terlalu sedikit dan tidak terlalu banyak, akan tetapi sarat akan kebersamaannya. Di suatu kelas yang mungkin pertama kali aku menginjakkan kaki disitu tidak terlalu kental dengan nilai kekeluargaannya.. akan tetapi, walaupun diawal awal waktu kita masih belum mengenal satu sama lain...masih belum bisa menilai diri masing-masing pihak. Telah jelas tergambar rasa kebersamaannya. Disaat Sang Pemimpin kita yang sangat amat tabah menyatukan visi menjadi manajemen46 yang kompak. Saya yakin, hal itu tidaklah mudah.Akan tetapi, ketika itu disuatu hari kita ingin mewujudkan apa yang telah diperjuangkan sang ketua untuk menjadi manajemen46 yang kompak. Pada saat itu ada penilaiian tentang kekompakkan kelas. Jelas pada saat itu debenakku tidak akan mungkin terjadi. karna saya yakin, kita masih belum mengenal satu sama lain, selain itu masih banyak orang-orang yang individualis. Semua itu terbantahkan dengan apa yang telah kita capai. Pada saat dilakukan penilaiian atas kekompakan kelas kita,tidak disangka kita menembus angka 100% dalam berbusana Muslim..Subhannallah..awalnya saya tidak percaya dengan pencapaiian itu. Semua teman-teman yang Muslim Alhamdulilah memakai pakaian Muslim tersebut. Semua pikiran yang melayang di benakku tentang ketidak kompakkan kelas menjadi sirna...Ini merupakan yang keAjaiban yang besar menurut saya...karna kelas yang tadinya masih berisikan orang-orang yang mementingkan egonya masing-masing telah terbantahkan dengan satu visi bersama menjadi Menejemen46 yang kompak.
Berbahagialah orang yang dapat memberikan tanpa mengingat dan menerima tanpa melupakan. #1Hari1Kebaikan
THE MIRACLE OF GIVING GIZI MEREKA ,TANGGUNG JAWAB KITA Masa kanak-kanak adalah masa yang paling penting untuk investasi gizi untuk perkembangan mereka di masa mendatang,namun sangat disayangkan kadang ada sebagian anak yang gizinya tidak terpenuhi,kendalanya biasanya dari masalah ekonomi orang tua si anak. Dari situlah saya dan teman-teman tergerak untuk menggaalakkan kegiatan POSYANDU ini,kegiatan ini selain mendapat bantuan dari kelurahan juga swadaya dari kami di bulan-bulan tertentu ada pemberian vit A dan faksinasi,dana biasanya kami dapatkan dari sumbangan orang2 mampu di sekitar kami dan juga dana iuran wajib RW. Kegiatan utamanya sebenarnya setiap minggu pertama di hari selasa setiap bulannya,meliputi timbang bayi,pemeriksaan ibu hamil dr Puskesmas dan pemberian faksin bagi bayi/balita. Namun yang menjadi beban pikiran kami di sini masih banyak anak dengan berat badan dan status gizi rendah,saya selaku penggerak sebenarnya sangat ingin sekali membantu lebih banyak kepada mereka dengan memberikan makanan tambahan yang bergizi,namun apa daya saya juga bukan orang yang sangat mampu,semoga dengan adanya program "SAHABAT TANGO SPREAD MIRACLE " ini semoga sedikit masalah bisa teratasi ,dengan memberikan makanan tambahan sehat bergizi untuk anak2 kurang mampu dan berada di garis kuning KMS. Terima kasih Tango.

"The Miracle of Giving" Pendidikan. Pendidikan merupakan hal yang sangat penting di zaman sekarang ini. Karena dengan pendidikan semuanya dapat diraih, oleh adanya pengetahuan. Tapi melihat pendidikan di negeri kita ini, rasanya sangat menyedihkan, banyak anak-anak yang belum pernah merasakan cipratan pendidikan. Mereka tidak dapat, karena biayanya yang sangat mahal. Mereka bukannya tidak mau, tetapi keadaanlah yang membuat mereka seperti sekarang ini. Mengapa untuk mengecap pendidikan saja, mereka susah. Mengapa? Banyaknya anak-anak yang buta huruf, banyaknya anak-anak yang buta pengetahuan, itulah contoh kecilnya. Oleh karena itulah sebenarnya mengapa bangsa ini memiliki banyaknya masalah, seperti busung lapar dan kekurangan gizi. Orangtua mereka sebelumnya juga sama seperti mereka, tidak tahu apa-apa tidak pernah mengecap bagaimana pendidikan, dan merekapun tidak memberikan gizi yang cukup untuk anak-anaknya, sehingga mereka bodoh dan miskin. Bagaimana kita tidak sedih kalau seperti itu, sedih melihat mereka tidak berdaya. Mereka kosong, kosong tiada berisi sedikitpun. Mereka terus saja tertawa di dalam kebodohan yang tidak pernah usai, mereka tertawa di dalam penderitaan yang sangat mendalam. Sejak kecil mereka sudah bisa merasakan bagaimana pahitnya kehidupan, kehidupan yang penuh dengan lika-liku penderitaan. Mereka tanpa menolak terus mencari uang untuk kelangsungan hidup mereka di luar sana. Mereka hanya bisa bermimpi tinggi, setinggi-tingginya tanpa tahu apakah mereka bisa meraih mimpinya itu atau tidak. Cita-cita mereka tinggi, tapi apa daya tanpa pengetahuan. Itulah mereka, anak-anak tidak berdosa, daging-daging kosong tanpa pengetahuan. Jangankan untuk pendidikan, untuk mengisi perut saja mungkin sangat susah rasanya. Aku sebagai pemuda Indonesia tentunya tidak sampai hati ketika mereka tidak tahun membaca, tidak tahu berhitung. Oleh sebab itu, aku sering membantu anak-anak di sekitar tempat tinggalku untuk sekedar membantu mereka membaca, dan menghitung. Merekapun menerimaku dengan baik. Aku sangat senang bila mereka bisa tertawa lepas ketika diajari, aku juga sangat senang ketika mereka bisa mengerti akan pelajaran-pelajaran mereka. Aku mau mereka maju, maju untuk menyongsong kehidupan yang lebih indah, dan maju untuk menyongsong Indonesia yang lebih maju. Hidup anak-anak Indonesia!

"Tango Spread Miracles" "The Miracle of Giving Birth and Giving Love all the time" Hal yang paling terindah adalah melahirkan seorang anak manusia, mengantarkan dia ke dunia untuk melihat indahnya kehidupan ini. 27 bulan yang lalu, tepatnya 10 September 2008, satu hari yang membuat hidupku benar-benar berubah. Kami memberinya nama "Russell Edward Soesanto". Tidak berhenti aku menatap wajahnya, memeluknya tubuh mungilnya untuk pertama kali, menghirup wangi kulit lembutnya. Seperti mimpi rasanya. Tiba waktu membawanya pulang ke rumah, melewati malam pertama tidak mudah. Anakku menangis setiap sejam sekali, padahal aku merasa lelah sekali. Aku menyusuinya, tapi anakku tetap menangis. Ternyata karena dia tidak nyaman menyusu langsung dariku, dia lebih mudah menyusu lewat botol. Aku berjanji pada diriku, aku harus bisa memberi ASI apapun yang terjadi. Akhirnya aku harus meluangkan waktu untuk perah ASIku setiap 2 jam sekali, Puji Tuhan karena rajin memerah dan keyakinan yang kuat, ASIku banyak dan anakku bisa ASI exclusive 6 bulan walaupun tidak menyusu langsung. Suatu kebahagiaan yang luar biasa. Saat ini anakku sudah tumbuh besar, sehat dan cerdas. Dia tipe periang sekali, tapi tetap saja bila sedang masanya "tantrum" aku seringkali menarik nafas dan tidak sabar menghadapinya. Terkadang aku tidak mengerti apa yang membuatnya tidak nyaman, tapi pelan pelan aku pahami. Akhirnya aku bisa menyingkirkan emosiku, menjadi lebih sabar. Anakku, kau telah mengajariku tentang bagaimana menyayangi tanpa ada batasan, mengajariku tentang kesabaran dan keindahan memberi tanpa mengharapkan balasan. Terima kasih Tuhan untuk kesempatan indah ini.

New post, Baked Potato Soup or everything awesome about baked potatoes in a bowl of something so warm and hearty, you might even briefly forgive January for being so ... wintry. Top with everything you'd load on a spud, or nothing at all. It works either way.
New post, Pizza with Bacon, Onions and Cream, a.k.a. Alsatian Pizza, flammekueche, Flammkuchen or tarte flambe, and perhaps a bit of a resolution buster, oops. I'm not sorry.
New post, Roast Chicken with Dijon Sauce. I've been holding out on you. We found our new favorite chicken dish last October, have made it repeatedly since, but I got caught up in the holidays and it fell through the cracks. It's quick, inexpensive, punchy with Dijon and the perfect way to end another blizzy day. You can still make up for lost time!
New post, Chard and White Bean Stew: Dinner last night was awesome. And if, understandably, the prospect of a healthy-sounding white bean stew doesn't capture your enthusiasm, imagine the same on a olive oil-brushed, garlic rubbed thick crouton, topped with a softly poached egg. Now you get it?
New post, Chocolate-Peanut Spread (or "Peanutella"), for people who enjoy Nutella but wondered how it would taste with peanut butter instead. Wonder no longer! 
New post, Mushroom and Farro Soup: Two weeks I admitted finding soup boring and near-universally disappointing and then proceeded to eat it every day since. The soup seal has been broken! This soup is anything but dull, loud with beef broth, porcinis, their soaking liquid, mushrooms and tomato paste. It demands consideration.

b'i am a land owner in wv who sold my gas rights to your comp. with other land owners in my area . the 120 days for you to pay for the lease has past and my neighbors are calling me because they all sighed because i said it would be good for all .if i could get some info for them it would be great\r\n'
b'Thank you, Chesapeake Energy, for (literally) knocking on my door at precisely the right time. I am completing renovations on my house, and was told I needed to update my septic system. I had no idea where the money was going to come from....until your representative showed up. The amount I received from my lease was exactly the amount I needed. \nYou guys were the answer to my prayers.'
b'Thank you Chesapeake! I have rented my house for 8 years now on Wilawana Rd and I have just found out that it will be torn down to build a large appartment complex in preperation for chesapeakes arrival on Mile Lane in Sayre. '
b'How do I find out about internships with you guys? I worked for Nomac for two years before I came back to school and now I am majoring in Geological Engineering at the University of Mississippi. Thanks'
b"It is totally ridiculous for the loud noise you guys allow in my residential area! I live in North Richland hills in Grace Meadows and the loud noise woke me and my family up 3X's. We have work and school and we need our rest for. The noise is excessive and you can feel the room vibrating. It's totally ridiculous! Especially from 11pm to 6am while people are trying to rest in the comfort of their own home. You can't used the same LOUD equipment you use in a vacant undelevloped area in a residential area! And work way into the night as well! I HATE the excessive noise and the totally disrespect just for a buck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
b'I just want to give a shout out to Chesapeake for the 11p to 6a beeping, pipe crashing, semi-truck reving and home vibration - without it - I could have actually slept last night - who would want to do that? North Richland Hills + Chesapeake = Love. Who cares about the actual people that LIVE THERE!'
b"I sent over information regarding Race sponsorship. I haven't heard anything yet. Let's go racing is just around the corner!!! "
b'ROAD WORK ALERT'
b'WHY CAN I NOT GET A CALL BACK FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!! I have 7 acres of land and want to just inquire and see about gas! My Family has been involved for over a year'
b'Sr. Reservoir Engineering Technician Lynn Looper was recently honored as a State Mentor of the Year Finalist at the 2011 David and Molly Boren Mentoring Awards Ceremony hosted by the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence. Lynn has volunteered for more than 10 years with the Chesapeake Energy Mentoring Program. Chesapeake launched its mentoring program in 1995 and now has more than 400 employees volunteering at four inner-city schools and has become the largest corporate mentoring program in Oklahoma.'
b'funny how some are giving chesapeake the devil about the roads in wetzel co wv.one day last week trying to go to work on one of the drill sites I found the roads a mess .only when I got on the part that chesapeake takes care of was I able to feel safe.great job Davy Lee '
b"Today was my first day at Chesapeake and I must say it went well. I see what the hype is about. The employees were cordial, knowledgeable, and they seemed energetic. It's nice to know I am making a difference when I sit at my desk. As expected, Chesapeake provides a top-notch environment for professionals who want to work and learn. I love my office, my computer, and my chk water bottles as well. I look forward to being the employee you expect. Thanks Aubrey...thanks CHK...see you after the Oklahoma Blizzard 2011 and thanks for thinking about our safety.\n\n-Trae McNeely "

Brown Sugar Pecan Shortbread featured in this Saturday's Winter Tea class
It always brings me cheer to know that there's an avocado in the house.
Wishing you a joyful new year filled with great meals to share with friends and family.
Any sort of fish cooked on the bbq with a tomato and basil salad,and to finish a pavlova with lots of thick cream and plenty of fresh fruit, i know that this sounds basic, but sometimes basic is best and maybe Manu's watermelon and champagne granita .
Hey guys:) First time I saw the show last week..and fell in love with it! ...and the Chef's are pretty HOT too;)...I forgot when and what time I watched it. So just incase you are wondering when as well...its on Wed. on the W network, channel 19 in my house:)...Kisses with lip gloss from Van City/Canada.
yay for having a tasmanian team this year!! GO TASSIE!!
After watching the 'sneak peak' videos, it seems the Victorian team will be the annoying, opinionated, never satisfied team of MKR 2011
I heart MKR!!! Lots lots, I can't wait for the show! Manu is devine. Manu, manu!!! 
Go Victoria!! Btw i know its got nothing to do with this page but are they bringing back My Restaruant rules?
Haha, this show is absolutely horrible, it's just an imitation of Masterchef. Typical Channel 7 and their inability to think of a good program themselves.
Bring on the WA Team - the Italian Mamas!!!!!! This is our year WA!!!!!!
To all the contestants on the new series from around Oz - congratulations, we wish you the very best!! Hope you enjoyed your experience (both positive and negative) on this amazing and fun show. To all the viewers we'll be joining you in watching it all unfold in the kitchen! Be nice to these guys they are living out their cooking dream - we can't wait to watch the flames begin! Go MKR 2011!! Love Shadi and Veronica 
To all the friends I met last year on this wall hope you're aboard ! Looking forward to this year's shenanigan's lol, this was a fun page to post on!
Go victoria team.
so can't wait for the show to start...last season was just awsome!!!!
Can't wait for the cooking to begin!! the show rocked last year
From sausages to steak, kangaroo to crocodile, what will you cook on your BBQ this Australia Day? Enter you best dish into the My Kitchen Rules State vs State competition to win! - http://bit.ly/MyKitchenRules
Bring on the TASSIE team!! Can't wait :)
go team victoria go go go 
Can't wait for the show to begin.........Go Sth Aust
SO can't wait for the show to begin, go NSW.....
kick some butt vic team...
I love a cooking show. It has been to long in non-ratings period..... now the fun begins!! Don't care who wins... all fun!!!
Can't wait for my kitchen rules to start Monday.Feels like for ever l have been waiting for it to come back
Does anybody here have some recipes they like to share l am always looking for new and interesting recipes world wide that are at a reasonable price and nutritious. Secret family recipes would be awesome but very hard to get a hold of.
yeh thank god for manu,, what a honey,,,, oh pete your cute too, but manu ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm yummy
So excited! We just got this show to air in Canada, and I'm obsessed! I never figured an extreme cooking show would be so exciting :) 
Thrilled there's a Tassie team this time round, was a scandal not to see one in S1 to showcase the exceptional quality of our produce, our passion for seasonality and our collective culinary prowess. I feel foolish for not knowing sooner, my partner and I would have loved to represent our magnificent state. Ah well, I look forward to seeing what our state reps can do! Don't let us down! All of Tassie is behind you!
LETS SUPPORT OUR LOCAL GUY'S FROM NAMBOUR PLAZA BUTCHER.. WHO IS WITH ME Amanda Stibbe-Neil
Just wondering when we will find out who the winners are from the competition for our creations you had on here? before tonights episode or not til another day? :-) Would really like that cookware!
Butchers Artie and Johnny (QLD) are about to start cooking! My Kitchen Rules starts in 5 minutes! (AEDT)
Do you think the judges giving their opinion before the other guests have tried the food would bias the other contestants? If Manu and Pete say, BAD, it's hard to imagine the others saying "NO , you're both wrong"! I dont know but wouldnt it be better for the judges to wait to comment ?
Comment of the evening has to go to Pete Evans when asking all the diners - "Does anyone have a hard one??", and someone replied - "No, it's only you two!" (meaning Pete and Manu) ... LMAO ... Classic dinner table comment, lol ... Love it!!! lol ... I thought perhaps he was getting a little "excited" over the dessert, but he was referring to the pears!! lol ;-)
Well done guys ! No egos there just a great effort :-)
Finally.... a couple of guys who just want to cook... well done guys!!
^^ the PORK looks so delicious n' the Desert looks spectacular :D well done guys 
Well after watching less than one episode of My Restaurant Rules its obvious that they have selected mediocre cooks who are going to struggle with the requirements of the show, just for ratings. Think its one show I'm happy to miss.
I loved Johnny and Artie....You guys looooooooved the pork too..Must try cook the delicious desert it looked stunning!
HELP - My tivo had problems with its aerial 2nite and did not tape the first episode, does anyone know if it is being repeated (and if so, when???), it is not showing me any future episodes when I go into the tv guide, but this could just be because of the aerial :( 
Channel 7 in Brisbane is crap .... the last 5 minutes it has been frozen on the cakes in the oven ... don't know who won the $20000, grrrrr.... is it just me??
Think the teams overall seem like nice down to earth people....particularly like the car dealers, the sisters, the cousins and the butchers lol
well done qld did a really good job....now time to relax and let the others feel the pressure
my favourite show... just love it.... Manu you are hot! Oh yeah great going you butchers I would have died for a bit of pork...mmm pig.....mmm
good to see a young team representing Victoria. I hope they do well, they look like they have their heads about them. Nice also that we have a good looking duo representing us! 
what was their score from the judges... our phone rang just as they were talking
Go Victoria! Hottest team by FAR. 
C'mon WA girls... Bring it home!! Thought the QLD boys did really well tonight... Lets the games begin!!
I thought Artie & Johnny did well tonight, onya boys. That pork - looked delish. I'm a WA girl so I gotta back the girls from WA. In saying that, good luck to all the contestants.
Get some Pork on ya fork. That pork crackle sounded amazing but can't wait to see what our WA girls bring to the table... 
The judges scoring seemed a lot more generous than last season. The pork did look divine ! 
Ugh! I don't know whether to cheer for the team Victoria (where I live) or for Daniela and Stefania (which are Italian like me) :D ahah! ... I <3 this show!

Is there a way to link the microchip forum with facebook?
OH my gosh! I had to get on and tell you... I have been carrying around my coupon for a free bag of chips, and I was just at my fav store, Winco, and picked up a free bag of Sweet Potato chips. OH, they are so good! Thank you!! You have a loyal consumer in me. Yummmmm.
Once again, I have eaten an entire bag of your sweet potato chips for dinner. I'm pretty sure FSTG should be subsidizing my gym membership.
We love the Sweet Potato Chips!
my one dog ate most of those sweet potato chips and i think that you dont need soo much salt!but thanks!
So I still have not found a store in my area that sales them. I hope to find a store before the coupon expires. Any ideas for a store or chain of stores that cares your band?
My mom got me hooked on the multigrain chips about a year ago. I in turn got my husband hooked on them! We buy them @ Costco and go through one of the giant bags in a week! I am now loving the cheddar and sent my husband out a while ago to get a bag of sweet potato chips! Regular chips...forget them! These are WAY better and good for you too!!
I your Multigrain Tortilla chips! Being a first time purchaser I will be looking for more of your products :) I found the chips @ Neighborhood Co-op Grocery in Carbondale, IL
I love your sweet potato chips!! I am also a first time purchaser - will buy again!
Enjoying you Olive AND Jalapeo chips with some delicious roasted red pepper hommus. Thanks for this awesome product! 
The "Chocolate" flavor tortilla chips....omg, They are INSANE!! I'm in love!
Almost time for the big football game so it's time to gain a little fame Try some cheese on our crackers in honor of the green bay packers or for the stealers fix a treat to enjoy from the sidelines or television seat and after you're full do a touchdown dance to enter yourself for a chance to win some cash for you to spend after the superbowl has come to an end but the chip bowl will always be filled to the top the mission of Food Should Taste Good will never stop Tackling hunger with a healthy snack which can be seen from the label on every sack You can always count on this Great Team Because Food Should Taste Good will follow its dream To present a product to our fans for which we are proud And win the approval of the crowd! 
OMG everything chips and cream cheese. Better than a fat bagel any day!!!
i voted for nathan barnatt because his video was just better than everyone elses
Nathan Barnatt's video is brilliantly done and hilarious.
I voted for Nathan Barnatt's video because, well, it's just the best. Period. The dude has mad dancing skills. Poor souls get jealous so easily!
People need to understand that Nathan is not a celebrity, no matter how much I wish he was. Unless you're Smosh or Shane Dawson and have over a million subscribers, the internet is not a very lucrative business and Nathan is trying to use it as a springboard into a successful comedy career. He made the best video and deserves to win to make more amazing videos and still have somewhere to live and have food to eat. I get that you're upset because you think you have no chance left, but don't blame Nathan. Blame the people who saw the funniest and most entertaining video and voted for it.
I'm only in it for the case of chips!! woot
I'd still love a case of chips and a hundred bucks, so i'm still in it!
I just want to stop by and give huge kudos for the efforts of FSTG to end childhood hunger via **nokidhungry** and Share our Strength! We love the blue corn chips, and knowing every bag we purchase contributes to an even greater cause than our snack attacks is heartwarming! :-)
With so many epic dances from both pros and joes, this weeks videos should go down in the hall of fame. Congratulations to Jeremy K., Tim O. and Nathan B. for winning our Touchdown Dance-Off weekly prize-pack - $100, a case of chips, and a custom leather football! We loved watching Jeremy and his buddys classic dance moves that made us want to get up and dance, Tim Os baby break it down in a way weve never quite seen before, and Nathan take his jubilant jig all over town! Submit your best moves for a chance to win our weekly prize pack or even the $10,000 grand prize! http://on.fb.me/FSTG_touchdowndanceoff
This contest is officially the Summerslam 1988 of chip contests. I hope to see a steel cage match in the very near future for the WWF title. Where is Mean Gene?
Still hoping for a free bag of chips... :)
I LOVE your Sweet Poatato chips. We bought 6 bags today!
Please stop bashing Nathan Barnatt. You're jealous that he's worked for years to get to the point he has. Maybe if people actually watched Nathan's videos and his commitment to trying to make a career out of his hobby, they'd be less likely to act like jerks. Also, he's got the most professional-looking video out of all of them, and if you view it in full screen, it's clear he's using a consumer-grade camera like everyone else. Remember: Envy is one of the seven deadly sins.
Your chips are so good....thanks for the coupon. I have added your products to my shopping list.
I love the sweet potato chips!
I just saw on your web site that you have a chocolate chip! My local supermarket doesn't carry them. How do I get a sample???
Found out about your products through this contest. I'm a sucker for chips, and they look really good, so I ordered a box of sweet potato, jalapeo, cheddar, and blue corn. Can't wait to try them out. =) 
Just wanted to pop in and let you know that I love your Olive tortilla chips. yum yum!!! I really wanted to try the sweet potato ones but my store did not carry them. Maybe I will find them on the shelf one day! :)
I voted for Nathan because he had the best video. Period. But now I would still vote for him just to shut up everyone who is whinning about it like a baby :D
Finally got a chance to try the Sweet Potato chips (right now!) and they are just as addicting as the multigrain I usually buy. Can't wait to try more varieties!
I have never heard of Nathan Barnatt. Ever. I have NO IDEA who he is. BUT because of all the controversy on here I just had to go check out his video and I thought it was HILARIOUS! And very well done. So I will vote for him. All of this complaining about him is getting him more attention. I never would have bothered if it wasn't for all the squabbling.
Who could eat your chips after reading all the mean spirited demoralizing comments fans have written to each other on your wall. What kind of company wants their fans ripping each other up to prove that they're a bigger fan of your product? Gross!
I just got the chocolate flavored chips and I can't wait to try them
These chips can not compare with any others
I hate you. One bag of olive chips and I'm hooked. I hate you. 'Nother bag from the store tonight.
olive chips???? where do i get them?????
I received a sample pack of your chips and I gotta say the sweet potato chips are absolutely delicious. Can't wait to try the others. In fact maybe I'll have some for breakfast right now! :)
I just had some of your OLIVE chips!! YUM YUM YUMMIE
I had seriously had to tell myself to put down the bag of multigrain chips and walk away! My favorite new snack by far!
Is everyone ready for the big game next Sunday? Check out Green Bay Packers Aaron Rodgers and his end zone celebration. Lets have some extra fun this week - anyone who does an Aaron Rodgers championship belt move in a new Touchdown Dance-Off video submission gets a case of chips! Whos going to win the big game, Packers or Steelers?
Grabbed a bag of Sweet Potato Tortilla Chips today. It's a little bag of heaven. I just ate them alone, but would love to partner them with some Laughing cow cheese. Oh Yum!
I got a coupon for a free bag of chips on Facebook. I used it this week and I was greatly impressed. The flavor of the Cheddar chips was awesome. They were fresh and tasty. Crisp, deliciousness. I would like to see some corn free chips as I am allergic to corn. This is a great product and I am going to tell everyone about them. So happy to have a healthy and really tasty snack.
I couldn't think of anything I like more than a sale on FSTG chips :) Got some at Whole Foods and was so happy :)
I picked up my first bag today courtesy of the free coupon and loved them. I got the lime chips and it was very difficult not to eat the entire bag. Thanks!
I tried my first bag today. Multigrain tortilla chips along with some hummus. These are amazing. I am newly gluten-free and frankly, these are a godsend. Thank you! 
I was a little skeptical of your product when most of what I saw at my local Whole Foods was sweet potato flavor (I don't like sweet potato flavor). But I got some samples at the gluten free social hosted by Gluten Free Birmingham and was blown away! I like most of them! Too bad they are not the least expensive item.
Ok guys go vote for our video....Just click on johnathon keenum..hope yall like it
I love, love, LOVE your Chocolate chips(but I am so bummed that they are so hard to find here in Madison, WI). Planning to make dessert nachos for the Super Bowl, and they'll be perfect!

Good work to you all, I've only had sweet potato chips, can't wait to try others, Happy New Year!
Multi-grain :-) can't believe my hubby ate Flaxseed and loved them!!! Thanks for a great product!! 
Multigrain is The Best I've ever eaten! So glad our Costco carries them.
Having a heck of a time finding the sweet potato chips. Got a coupon to try them but can't find any. I'm in Easley SC and have Bi-lo and Ingles. 
love your multgrain and sweet potato chips! thank you for using non-GMO ingredients!
Love the sweet potato chips and the olive ones as well- delicious! No MSG or autolyzed yeast either, which is what I have to watch out for. Thank you for using all natural ingredients!
received my free coupon, but finding the sweet potato chips is going to be a mission. Wish me luck!!!
Sweet potato chips so delish!
we have tried olive and sweet potato...love them both..my little girl loved the sweet potato...can't wait to try the other flavors! Thanks for the yummy snacks..
Love the Olive chips. Not sold in my area so have to special order or have my mother-in-law send me some! :)
Love the sweet potatoe chips?
I think it would be simply awesome if you could do a variety pack @ Costco. I always buy your multigrain variety each and every time I am there but would love to get some of the other flavors in Costco size and price!!!!
I am addicted to the sweet potato chips! My two year old says that they are delicious.
Happy New Year everybody! Seems like 2011 is gonna be a hot one at least if you ask Jalapeo. Just look at our first giveaway with everything from a gourmet hot sauce six pack to a chili pepper growing kit. Enter to win on our Giveaway tab. http://bit.ly/FSTGgiveaway

I purchased a bag of chips while in Atlanta for christmas and I LOVED them. I have never tasted a better chip. I have only tired the multi-grain and cannot wait to try more.
I got a coupon for a free bag and that is the only reason I even tried them and LOVE them. The Multigrain are the Best but so hard to find. Seems like my publix and target always have the sweet potato and lime but i Love the Multrigrain! Now whenever I find them, I stock up!
LOVE "the works!" yum yum yum yum Multigrain is bueno too, but The Works YUM!!!!
Love me some jalepeno. Wish more stores carried. Best flavor!
I got my coupon for my free bag, and got the sweet potato. They are amazing! We dipped them in a roasted red pepper hummus... OMG! It was fantastic! I am now hooked. :)
I love all our chips. Thanks for making something so natural and tasty! 
How do I enter the contest ? Love the cheddar !!!
You guys make the best chips ever! I will never buy another brand. Your flavor selections are awesome... 
i just got my free bag! had them with a weight watchers jalapeno cheese wedge! these chips are amazingggggggggggg !!!!!!! tyyyyyyyy!!!!!
i love your chips but not a fan of the sweet potato one. i bought it last week with a disappointment. nobody ate the chips either in the house which is surprising cause everyone likes the chips i bring home well not this flavor. oh well its a hit or miss. 
just used my free coupon for the olive tortilla chips! they are so great and taste awesome with hummus! thanks!
Sweet potato chips are delicious! Will recommend to my friends and bring a few bags to the next gathering!
I went to Meijers and I could not find any of food should taste good band. is it located by organic or chips?
i used my free coupon for the multigrain chips. it was the only kind i could find at our krogers. they are really good! thanks!
Just wanted to thank-you for the free coupon, and discount coupons I received. I thought I was getting the sweet potato flavor just for ME; my family loved them & now I'll use the other buy 2 get 2nd one free coupon!
I got your coupon and i can't wait to try the sweet potato!!!
the sweet potato is my fave. it is amazing!
I've never been so in love with a food brand. The Sweet Potato are my favorite, but I have yet to try them all.
I won a case of chips on Dec 10th through Twitter and haven't received anything yet. I also noticed that the twitter id "oliveforoliver" that I won through has been suspended as well. Can someone please help me out? I was really excited about getting these chips!
got my coupon but dont know where to get my chips at.. seems no one around my area has them
I just got my coupon too!! do you know if Costco will take the coupon? 
I tried your chips (multigrain) when I received the free coupon. I just bought the sweet potato, now I just hope I can find the Lime chips. The store by my house only sells 4 flavors and not the lime. They are all so good so far.
Got my coupon for a free bag. Tried the olive ones - AWESOME. Can't wait to try the rest. Thank you Food Should Taste Good.
these chips are great, I bought "The Works" tortilla ones! 
I was so surprised today when UPS showed up with 4 full size bags, I was pleased with the service I received the other day on the phone with Megan....I was expecting maybe a couple bags of trial size, when I received 4 full size bags for my family to try! So far we tried the chocolate kind and they are so yummy.....Thank You Food Should Taste Good....... :)
I picked up a bag of your chips at my local ShopRite. I got "The Works" and they are AWESOME!!!! Thank you for making such a great product.
I came across the Sweet Potato chips by sheer chance today at Sunset Foods in suburban Chicago. I'm hooked! I'm so happy to find them as I'm in the process of going gluten-free.

Excuse repeats please! New phone... and I like the chips THAT much. :)
Best food- man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word God speaks.
Got my first bag of FOOD SHOULD TASTE GOOD chips today, sweet potato. I was expecting them to be on the bland side but I must say I'm surprised as they are rather tasty! Thumbs up!
Thank you for the coupon for the free bag. Tryed the olive, very tasty. My 3 year old even likes them. 
I got your free coupon and found your chips at Kroger in the health food department, I got the Olive flavor and I gotta tell ya they rock !! 
First bag I tried was the Multi Grain...hooked on the first chip. Then I found the Sweet Potato..need I say more??? Now when ever I find them (BJ's wholesales carries the large bags) I stock up.... :)
OMG! The Sweet Potato chips are the BEST things on Earth! I have all of my friends eating them!!!
I just tried the sweet potato chips...found them at Whole Foods. No words can express the sheer joy in eating these! WOW!!! I'm on my way to the nearest Costco to see if I can buy these in bulk. If so, my kids will be packing these with their lunch. Can't wait to try the others!
hello, I contacted the food should taste good site a few weeks ago because i still have not received my free bag of chips voucher. And the person i spoke with said he would send it right out, but it's been several weeks, and still no voucher?..... can you help??
I love the Olive.....could hardly stop eating them!! Thanks.
Hello Food Should Taste Good People, I was finally able to redeem my coupon for a free bag. You guys have created an amazing product. I was delighted with the multi-grain chips I got today and they went great with my roasted pepper hummus! Nice job! Your food does taste good!
why or why have i not tried dipping these chips yet? im 5 flavors in and i have yet to dip hahaha
Rec'd my coupon for a free bag. Thank you so much!! I chose Sweet Potato - yum! Great crunch, just right on the salt, subtle flavor...what's not to love? <3
After reading the reviews, I can't wait to try these amazing chips. I'm in southern CA, anyone know where I can pick some up? :)
THANK YOU for making this product! I'm a culinary student and currently in nutrition class working on a project about GMOs when I found out about your company. We LOVE your products. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! 
Tweaked the Cobb Salad Dip recipe since avocado's are hard to find right now and loved it. Even hubby who normally scoffs at my culinary creations ate this dip right up and loved the jalepeno chips. Thank you!
Hi, I used my coupon to buy the free FSTG chips. I bought the cheese chips. They were very good, just thought the cheese flavor could be a little stronger but overall very nice. Thanks.
My favorite thing this week will be having Food Should Taste Good chips in one hand and a remote control for watching movies from Netflix in the other hand. I haven't try any other flavors except the multigrain flavor but I will check Jalapeno flavor.
Just tried the Sweet Potato for the first time. SO GOOD!

Awesome, great tasting! 5* Sweet potato my fav!
Wouldn't mind tasting the sweet potato, my kids absolutely love them. 
Wouldn't mind tasting the sweet potato, my kids absolutely love them. 
are there any stores in NE Arkansas (Jonesboro) that carry these chips? I have not found a place to redeem my coupon.
I went online and checked to find out where I could locate your products since they didn't have them in the town I reside in. So I went to another town that was on your list and asked them is they had your product and they stated that it might be in the back and that they just hadn't put it on the shelves yet. It's a pain trying to locate a place to find them before the coupon expires.
i drove all the way to brandenburg to get these damn chips cuz thats were you all told me they were when i called you and guess what they werent there i say you owe me 20 bucks 
I just wanted you to know that I finally got my free bag yesterday with my coupon and I got the Multigrain. They are delish!! I am sold and will most definitely be buying your brand more often. Healthy AND good, what more could I ask for?? Thanks again for the free coupon!
I just tried the olive chips. They are awesome!!!!
I can't fiond the jalapeo chips - Any ideas? I love hot stuff!!
How do I contact someone at your company? I just ordered a bunch of crackers and they're shipping to the wrong address! I need my Cheddar Crackers! Help!
Just picked up some more lime, I wish they'd had jalapeno, I didn't even know those existed. I need some!
I love the Multigrain chips. I feel more healthy every time I eat some. They have some great ingredients in them. 
I got the chips today @ krogers.
I got the sweet potato ones....they r fantastic! Is there any way I can get some coupons? Thanks!
Multigrain chip baby! Delish with Moose soup!
just got a case of them today - Olive, Multigrain, The Works, Cheddar, and Yellow Corn :) Yummy! 
LOVE YOUR CHIPS
Tackle Blue Corns caption challenge and share yours in the comments.
Loved the placement on Parenthood! The box is so distinctly yours, and it was so nicely placed. By the way, my favorite is Lime.
thanks for the free coupon! I luv ur sweet potato chips! Onolicious!! :)
Tried to use my coupon for sweet potato chips at Target and they told me they had never heard of that brand???Where can I get these, I want to use my coupon...
I jjust tried to get a coupon but the form doesn't fit in my screen and there's no page scroll to make it work or your contact by email form either.
i live in colorado city,texas zip 79512, and i can't find any sweet potatoe chips,and that means i can't usev m6y coupon!
I'm a couple days behind, but just watched Parenthood on the DVR and saw the beautiful box of Food Should Taste Good. I'm wondering which flavor was in that box.....mmmm hopefully it was my favs, the multigrain. :)
Tried the Sweet Potatoe Chips today for the first time, and absolutely LOVE them!!!
Just tried the Olive Chips! Fabulous with both garlic hummus & roasted red pepper hummus. I'm hooked!
I purchased the tortilla type (not sure if that's the official name of not) last week w/the free coupon I received. They were awesome!! I shared them, sparingly, w/friends at work. Everyone loved them. It was great to have something so good for me taste so good as well. Thanks!
I received a coupon and redeemed it for a bag of chocolate tortilla chips. They were great plain but one night I melted chocolate chips on them and all of my wildest dreams came true. This week is my birthday and we are making "food should taste good Chocolate Nachos" instead of birthday cake!!! Thank you for opening my live to the possibilities of natural chips.
Absolutely LOVE your chips/crackers, all varieties, but the packaging... not so much. I find the bags really hard to open, and they tear down the length of the bag rather than across the top. Any chance of changing this? Or do I just have to continue to eat a whole bag each time I open one.... not that that's a BAD thing! :)
I finally finished my free bag of the olive variety. They were delicious, and I could really taste the olives, even through the insane amount of sodium. Any chance a healthy product like this could cut back some on the salt? I am usually a salt fiend, and I could only eat a few of these at a time because of it. Otherwise, SO TASTY!
I used my coupon to get the muti-grain ! D Double Delicious ! Thanks so much any chance I can get get more coupons with cents off !? I cant waite to try other flavors!
These chips are truly d e l i c i o u s !!! Glad I f o u n d you guys ~ hoping to see you e v e r y w h e r e !!! =D
I just had the Blue Corn for the first time. My only complaint...I wish the bag was bigger. They are very tasty!
I finally got around to using the free coupon you mailed to me. I picked the Olive bag. YUMMY!!! Thanks for the opportunity to taste something great.
finally found a store n my town that has the lime flavor, so yummy, and great with the fresh salsa i bought
I am now a HUGE fan! I used my free coupon to purchase the multigrain and my 6 year old niece practically inhaled the bag! Needless to say I think she is a fan as well! I can't wait to try more flavors ... but the multigrain will now be a staple at my house. (but I now know that when my niece comes over she will have to have her own bag or I may not get any! LOL)
I love these chips ! Im gonna make a video for the Dance off Hope u love it !
Non GMO Label! I love it. It's about time we started labeling like this! Thanks for lookin' out! :)
BEST CHIPS EVER!
I used the Olive tortillas as a cracker with my potato salad. love it.

I just want to buy a big bag!!! I can only find the little ones... boo
I sure do love the sweet potato chips! Wish I had coupons....Wish they were available in more stores. I currently have to get them when I go to the doctor because it's a 40 minute drive one way. And there's only one store that has them. Why don't you sell them at Walmart so everyone can get them? Walmart is everywhere.
Your sweet potato chips are sooooo addictive!!!
Could someone tell me where I can get these chips? I live in the u.p. of Michigan and can't find these anywhere!

New Worst Cook In America - Begins Tonight.:)
I've seen Chef Alton Brown of "Good Eats" use a tea kettle on his show that I really like. It's stainless steel and, instead of a whistle, it has these two rocketships that spin when the water comes to a boil. Anyone know where I can find one?
season one was great! So I'm having great expectations about this season... so far I don't like much the veggie blonde or the lesbian lady...but will see how evolve ...as chef Anne is superb ....all her dishes are to die for!
 Just saw the Worst Cook show and Anne is a real &*^%%$ sounds like witch but starts with a B. I am a good cook and written up for my cooking. She is nasty and her clean plate fetish is mayby okay for a chef but these people are not chefs. This show clearly blows. If Anne expects someone that nows what they are doing go to some cooking school.
I was reduced to hysterics several times watching the season premiere. Holy mackerel! The one with the spray cheese really got me. That and the food poisoning girl. Yipes!
anyone have a good pulled pork recipe....
watching iron chef, white house, i saw one chef give another chef a taste from a bowl,then dip in back in the bowl, then taste it himself, and then dips it back into the bowl. now i know its frowned upon to dubble dip into the food, but for two people putting their mouth on the same spoon from the same bowl and then use it to keep mixing. wellllll!!! i don't think so. just saying pay attention.

Help...I was just quoted that my 24 inch GE oven needs new ignitors and they want me to dole out $420 for parts and labor. Do I replace the ignitors for a smaller-than-standard oven or just buy a new one? If I do buy a new oven...any recommendations for restaurant suppliers near Philadelphia?
I just discovered "Worst Cook in America" and while I'm not nearly as bad as those people, there is no way I could ever cook what they are cooking by the end. Very impressed with this show....learning all kinds of things! Thanks!
Does anyone have any good recipes for chicken breast to put over rice
Marinade is usually a mixture to add flavor to the food marinade usually will have an acid to help tenderize meat i.e. Italian dressing to marinate chicken.
Paula Deen Plastic Bag Omletes are not a good idea. Do the research she should not recommend this at all. I love her recipes but those boil bag omelets are not safe to eat. The research is still out on this one but think of this. They tell you that plastic water bottles that sit out in sun can be carcinogenic now what makes you think that a zip lock bag or even a cheaper brand can be healthy for you. 
I just made Ina Gartens Parmesan and Thyme Crackers. AMAZING!!! ***** Stars!
Question for anyone who can answer!!! Gonna make a boxed yellow cake but have a ton of lemons...how do I add the lemon to make my cake a lemon cake..and will the cake still be moist?
CUPCAKE WARS....Again this new season, if you watch the beginning segment when they say someone will be having their cupcakes previewed at and they show the clip with people eating cupcakes....tonight they showed someone eating a cupcake with a cherry on top...well guess what...the guy who put cherries on top won. You need to skip the beginning if you don't want to know who wins.
Awesome, I just liked this to make the same complaint that Kathy made just 20 minutes ago. 27 minutes into Cupcake Wars you know who wins because of the intro trailer. I had figured you'd fix this after the first season?! Also Justin Willman... puns really are the lowest form of humor. 
Why is Scott Conant always such a JERK when judging on Chopped???!!!
Goat brains? I think Alejandra needed to be the first chopped. First, raw meat. Second, bones in the food. And the judge Scott is not my favorite at all. I felt that he was demeaning to Sammy.
Chef Sammy should have one. Note to Scott (and I hope their Social networking person sends this to the host, producers, and Scott). To state that a person shows signs is quite demeaning. Alexandra had bones in her fish, raw meat, and a pungent dessert...and she wins! This is why she won: The hispanic judge kept speaking of culture and wanted her to win because they are similar in background. Scott didn't like fried foods. Sammy had one advocate at the table. One note to Sammy: Please don't let this deter you from reaching your dreams. In other words, take the criticism that works for you and throw out everything else. 
Wow, I too liked this page to complain about Cupcake Wars! Kathy and Matthew are correct, if you want the intro you know who wins. Also, when they say, and one by one they will be eliminated, they pan the contestants in order from winner to the first person kicked off the show. PLEASE CHANGE THE INTRO!!!
I am so upset with the Food Network for allowing the judges to give away a win to someone who did not deserve to win on the most recent episode of chopped! I have seen lots of close calls but this one was too obvious. Chopped was one of my favorite shows and now Im tempted to never watch it again because Im so pissed!!! Complaining that the guy fried everything in his basket. Are you kidding me? Was it good? according to you all it was but yet you still chose to give it to someone who had a ton of fat and bones in her main course.
i have a suggestion for a pizza place here in WA for food network. either triple d. or throwdown! seriously the best pizza on earth!
The look on Sammys face! My god! You people made me hate you for that lingering close up shot of his face 
I cannot agree with Mike Walsh more... I used to have respect for the judges sitting on the panel for Victory on the Brain, Episode CQ0602H. However, how could they reward a contestant whose desert they all didn't even like and all agreed that she did not use the main ingredient correctly. This show is getting more capricious every show. That's why no self-respecting chefs will go on the show. They are resorting to "self-taught" chefs and sometimes nothing more than good cooks. Where ever you are Sammy, I would rather eat your dinner anytime and you are a fine person. The least this show could do is invite you back.

What is our beloved Chairman from Iron Chef America doing playing super villian Wo Fat on the new Hawaii Five-0 series?
I have been watching "Chopped" too much! My kids promised to make me breakfast this morning and they presented it in "Chopped" fashion with two breakfasts using the same ingredients but slightly different. I had cheerios and milk with orange and seaweed slices floating in it, and then cheerios and milk with frosted animal cracker cookies on top. Hmm....
Goat brains, fish heads, and durian?! That's not a challenge... that's just mean.

Here's my scoop: I don't have cable (refuse to pay for it!), but I LOVE FN. I've had so much fun watching the shows on the website. I just clicked over, and I'm very upset to see you stopped offering Good Eats! Why? That show alone made FN worth watching! Please bring back the episodes online!!!
i loove the next food network star.... but when is it goin to start? i might see my teacher on it!!!!
Probably can't say as much as I want because they limit posting sizes...so here goes. I make this appeal to the FN people and all the chefs and cooks and staff at the FN and any network broadcasting a food show. Can we please STOPPPP the use of food fights...the waste of food in ads about food fights. People are starving out there in our own country. We don't need to see the food fight as people throwing food around. I see chefs on the show say they are raising money for their charity and it's food for the poor. Well...dont you everrrrrr let anyone do a commercial where food is being wasted in a cheap commercial.
When a chef on the FN is cooking with wine...I wish they would tell you what kind of wine they are using. Instead of just saying a white or red wine. It would really help people like myself, who is not a wine drinker and really doesn't know that much about wine, in choosing a wine. It would be very helpful information on the cooking episodes. 
(IF ANYONE WHO HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH FINDING NEW IDEAS FOR FOOD BASED PROGRAMS SEE'S THIS MSG, I FEEL THAT I HAVE A SHOW THAT WILL CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE SEE FOOD ALL OVER THE WORLD) THRU MY EYE'S
 would really love it if they would come up with a show that teaches cooking for those of us that are diabetic. would really like to learn to cook my own diabetic type meals without having to spend tons of money on weight watcher type foods
I would love to see a Vegan or Vegetarian Cooking Show!!! I find it hard sometimes trying to figure out how to make some of the dishes I see vegetarian.
Thank You Paula Deen , After having major CANCER surgery in June 2010 I was not able to eat much of anything so I tuned in to Food Network and began watching non stop Thanks to many recipes provided by PAULA DEEN I was able to get my appetite back and actually gain back some of the 70 pounds I lost. The chicken georgia is actually the best and I make it about twice a month. Thanks again Food Network and especially Paula Deen

I can't stand watching the Neely's, are they cooks or infants, My goodness, their food looks good, but the way they interact and all that baby talk, makes me nauseous. I have literally muted the channel just to see what they were cooking. 
I had to change the channel ... I could not take hearing Paula Dean say "Flour" any longer. 
Really wish Food Network would have a show (even just a 1x show) for those of us who are newly married/new homeowners/new cooks who need a little guidance in supplies for our new kitchens as well as kitchen maintenance ie: knives/sharpening/cutting boards that dull, sanitization, what to put down the drain and what not, how to dispose of things like cooking oil, etc., how to load a dishwasher (my hubby had never used one before!)along with what you should and should not put in one!, how to extinguish a kitchen fire, cleaning the coils on your fridge...I think that's all I have for now...but that would be really helpful!

addicted to food network wahaha :) cookin and baking sweets and treats its heaven 
Chopped... Love the show. How about two Chef teams. Can they work together if one has to take the lead?
All day on new years i just sat on the couch and watched the next iron chef marathon :) best day ever! :D
I just love Barefoot Contessa.( Ina garten). She is really an inspiration to watch. She just knows how to talk to the camera. She is very talented and has MAJOR knowledge about cooking food. I learn everytime I watch her. Isnt it interesting she doesnt have to say, "yall" in every sentence she speaks? Or have a "fake" laugh. She also doesnt have to pimp her husband out and make nasty sexual comments to boost episodes. Why? Well...because she knows food.
Whats up with that idiot Giada speaking in an Italian accent whenever she gets to an italian ingredient!! Shes as fake as they come!!And her stupid eyes rolling back in her head everytime she licks something!!I got something...well...nevermind!!
maybe Giada can give up her singing career while she is cooking - it is not cute anymore. It is getting to be a turn off
I really think that the mark has been missed with healthy eating. Today is buying into the hype of what is healthy and what is not, not actually addressing real food and real health. I realize that there is a lot of disagreement on what is healthy or not, but we do know that healthy fats are essential to brain growth. Too much of this is 'fat and calorie restriction' not 'eating healthy'. I applaud the attempt.
HUGE sale on Aleia's cookies and Little Bay Baking products this week at www.mynaturalgrocer.com!
could aarti stop saying YUM, she is not talking to children........I have only started watching her the last two shows...and although I might like what she is making I cannot watch her talking like she is a kindergarten teacher.
I'm sitting here watching "Ten Dollar Dinners" and wishing there was a cookbook from Melissa with all the recipes from the show - with pictures! 
I love many of your shows but I've noticed lately that several of your hosts say to use "just a little bit" of this or that ingredient. Last time I looked, "a little bit" is not a standard unit of measure. I know I can get specific measurements in the recipes online but I sure wish the hosts would be more specific about how much of an ingredient they are using instead of defaulting to, "just a little bit".
Love all the cake shows! ;)
Have been on a soup kick with my crockpot. Made Carrot Ginger soup!
would someone be really super nice and copy and paste a recipe on here for me..my computer won't load the link (it picks and chooses what pages it wants to open) and I really would love to make this..I just saw it the other day but can't remember the measurements..its the "Peanut Butter Nanner Icecream" from the show "5 ingredient fix"
wishes they'd muzzle that host on "Cupcake Wars" - not that this particular show is a priority of mine, but when you don't get Cooking Channel and it's the only thing on, it's ridiculous to listen to his babbling
I am totally rooting for Angelo Sosa on Top Chef! My favorite FN show, and not just because Tom is smokin' hot either!
I think Pitchin' In is the best new show on FN. It is hilarious, and the show where Lynn gets hit on by the chicken farmer is awesome! Loved her on Restaurant Makeover, and it just gets better.

Ok, Bobby Flay is a real person. I've watched him even before Iron Chef and I was a secret fan. I was amazed that he responded back to my post about making his difficult Coconut Cake. I don't even care about how bad it looks now. How do I show him my appreciation? I can't go to his restaurants so maybe I'll buy his book or something.....he already has success and may not need my money.... maybe I'll say a prayer!

My family loved Alton's Vanilla wafers, but found that I had to use my melon baller to get the right amount of dough. The 1 oz scooper (my smallest) was far too much dough per cookie. When he says "teaspoon-size" he means it.
Dinner last night was based on a tweet FN sent. They said "Saute shrimp with garlic and EVOO, deglaze with champagne". I did, adding salt and a little black pepper, and used Cava instead of Champagne. We should have served it over Linguini, but it was fine just on it's own with no carbs. Being a Wine Guy, I paired it with a Napa Cellars 2009 Chardonnay, perfect meal for a reasonable price.
I've been looking around online today and couldn't find my answer. :-) So, what appliances are used in Kitchen Stadium? I know a KA mixer, but what brands are the other appliances?
This weekend they did Healthy ideas. Anne Burrell did a chiclen dish with yogurt and something eles then dipped in saltines and baked. Does anyone know what the something eles was? I've look on the website and can't seem to locate it. Any help or ideas would be lovely. 
FN if you dont remember you have been hacked in the past. Posting a cryptic message and shortened mystery url for your members to click isnt the smartest idea.

Congratulations Chef Eric!! You deserved this win not just for your skills, but for your humility and GREAT ATTITUDE!!!! FIRE IT UP!!!!!
I just watched the episode of Chopped and thought the judges were biased. I didn't catch all the names but contestant Eric won. It appears that the panel based their judgment on contestants that have tragic stories or are intimidating. I wonder if Eric did not say he was battling cancer for the second time, would the panel score the contestants the same way.
I totally agree with the previous posts about tonight's show.So disappointing.Judges are suppose to judge the chefs abilitity to cook not their characters .That's what we ordinary people do at the restaurant. I liked Chopped until today...sloppy judging.

I'm watching Sandra Lee. She was using a spoon to spread jerk seasoning on chicken breasts, but then she kept dipping the same spoon into the jar. That's not food safe. You'd think she know better.
I have been a fan of the network for over 15 yrs, I <3 the Food Network. But I'm wishing some of the chefs would start creating healthier dishes 4 those of us that are on a diet or want 2 eat healthier. My partner doesn't even want 2 watch at night because it gets her hungry 4 all the wrong foods esp when Guy visits the diners w great looking (and fat filled) burgers and desserts :) 
Got huge pieces of beef bone boiling to make a big hearty batch of French Onion Soup, toasting up some Oatmeal to make AB's Oatiest Oatmeal cookies, and considering baking up some braided garlic-herbal breads... Having a snow-day out of work is actually keeping me busy! LOL

Hey FN, why is the show "Private Chefs of Beverly Hills" not on DirectTv anymore? When it is, it's played inder "Ace of Cakes" and I only get half a show.
Could someone please help. I need a dish for my 8 year old boy who can't have sugar, but something the whole family can eat. I have pretty much run out of things new to cook for him and he is asking for a new dish. PLEASE any ideas will help
I just thought this was kinda funny, My 3 yr old just corrected me. I said oh Anne is on and He said No mommy it's Chef Burrell
After making an angel food cake, with 12 egg whites, what do I do with the yolks?

I have the perfect idea for a tv show for your network. It's oringinal, funny and very interesting for after hours home cooking. This is a serious idea and worth atleast listening too.
Hi i just saw on Iron Chef America where Bobby made cornbread "sticks" what i wanna know is wether or not U guys have the breadstick pan for sale online???
Hi there !!!! I was just watching the show IRON CHEF AMERICA and I've to say that all the food that came out of that episode was just amazing looking. I'm talking about the one where Bobby got his but kicked in the canadian lobster challenge. I mean he's a great chef but he lost because of a clear lack of creativity. So I was wondering what would happen to them if they get to work with real ingredients, the one that nobody ever saw before?, where are the giants octopus? the soft shell turtles, original goose foix gras? I mean i have seen a cherry challenge and now a coconut one is coming up... I feel like this is getting just boring, where is the excitiment? Why do you want the jury to vote for some food they already had in the past? what would their face be like if at the ehd they had to try insects, scorpion fish, crocodile or even snake or stingray? Don't you guys wanna challenge america's iron chefs to open up to the world a little more? as the original Japanese TV show was?
I love watching food network. All the different dishes and challenges result in very creative dishes. I'm watching Iron Chef and they are working with coconuts. I just wish they would let Morimoto speak for himself. He may not be very fluent but I can understand him fine. I don't need someone talking over him to explain his dish. I watch this on a regular basis. Love watching it. 
I like watching Chopped, Triple D, Iron Chef America, and Unwrapped... however, even if I've just eaten a filling meal, they make me HUNGRY!! lol
Dear Food Network: I would like to make a suggestion for Chopped. I would like to see some of the judges compete. They spoke on the re-run tonight to one of the contestents that he needed to learn humility....I think they need it themselves. I would like to see Aaron, Alex, Chris and Geoffrey....and the judges should be a selection of the Iron Chefs!!

My wife Rosa died on Wednesday after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, The one thing she watched for the past year has been the Food Network. It got her through the day. Her favorite was Ina Garten, but she also loved Sunny Anderson, Guy Fieri, Paula Deen, and Giada De Laurentis. Her favorite shows were Chpped, The Next Food Network star, the Next Iron Chef, The Great Food Truck Race, 24 Hour Resturant Battle, and Cupcake Wars. Watching this network made her very happy
Ah...healthy? No...unfortunately. Tacos tonight and homemade pizza tomorrow. Pulled pork sandwiches on Sunday.

I have learned to not be afraid of spices and herbs when cooking, I thought I was a good cook before, I surprise myself when I get bold and add some of this and some of that.....mmmmmgood.
anyone have a recipe for a cookie with dates and coconuts?????
Just severed my relationship with the other cable provider and now I'm hanging out with Fios - I got Food Network AND The Cooking Channel....well all right now!
Did any one watch the Neelys this morning? Pat Neely didnt say one "ya'll" nor once did he give that fake laugh. I am only HOPING this is a recent episode. He was way more enjoyable to watch.
I wish Chopped was on more often. I adore Ted Allen. The baskets are also challenging at times.

Watching Big Daddy's House with Aaron Mc & special guest Claire Robinson OMG!!! The chemistry is SICK! Food Network should seriously put these two together to make a whole new show. I couldn't decide if I wanted to be Claire or one of those Lamb meatballs LOL
wow hello to all my friends in the food network site im looking for new customers any feel like they need a safer home holler at me see what im talking about 
Alton Brown has won Best Male Host in a Series, and Good Eats has won Best Chef in a Series from the Tasty Awards 2011! Obviously, people really like him and his show - let's get Food Network to understand that taking Good Eats down to one night a week was a bad idea!
Shame on Anne Burrell during her recent "Secrets of a Restaurant Chef" latest episode making meatballs. You said you would rather not make the meatballs using dried oregano if you did not have fresh.....Well honey - If you do not have access to fresh oregano, and believe it or not there are a lot of home cooks that do not, you shouldn't make it at all??? Well how elitist of you. You have just closed out a lot of folks that watch your show. Why not instead say you can covert to dried IF fresh is not available...and say it may not have quite the same flavor, but will also be good? Hope you don't loose audience share because of such exclusionist comments.
Great show Chairman Mark Dacascos I just watched Solar Attack great flick :)
I wish i could post a picture..i watched "Worst cooks in America" when the Blue team made the pork with Butter compound and asparagus..I made it last night from memory and it was fantastic!!! I love chef Anne!!! Anyway..i love me some GUY too!!! Love DDD!!!
What main dish is good with a red quinoa side dish?
Our family is gearing up for our very own "Iron Chef" challenge - the two contenders are my hubby (a former chef, but really a foodie at heart) and my 15 yr old son (who has "suffered" through years of hubby's experiementation in the kitchen and who also loves to cook). My 8 yr old daughter and I have chosen the secret ingredient, have laid out the table with things that they can use in the kitchen, the table is set - the knives and cutting boards are coming out and the grill, the fryer and the oven are turned on. Soon the battle will begin. One secret ingredient. Two cooks (two judges). Three entres. ONE hour and ONE winner. Will post some pics and results as things go along. 
I dont have time to make this roast beef can i cut it up to make stew? 
Thanks Paula Dean and The Food Network for the awesome dinner this evening. Shrimp Po' Bubba's and your Tartar sauce. Even better, I couldn't eat a second sandwich so instead I put some tartar sauce on a piece of romaine lettuce topped it with 2 shrimp and a slice of tomato. Perfection....
saw a Paula Deen show this afternoon with a iced tea brine chicken but i can't find the recipe. Can anyone help?
My sweet baby girl is now eating solids and to save us money, I want t make her food instead of buying it. Does anyone know some good receipes?
can you please tell me who or where to contact someone about a Food Network Cake Challenge idea? I have a child who has severe food allergies and it is hard to find cakes for her and think it would be a good idea :)
 - I made Bobby Flay's "Grilled Sea Scallops with Green Onion Relish and Warm Bacon Vinaigrette" and they were delicious! I got his "Grill It" cookbook for Christmas and am more anxious for Summer than I've ever been (though I do grill in the Winter too). Paired it with Sake Poached Salmon and a wonderful romaine salad with feta cheese, tomatoes, and scallions - topped with Raspberry Vinaigrette dressing. Can anyone say - YUM! :D
I am SO addicted to Food Network!! I love watching "Worst Cooks In America", I just don't understand HOW someone can't cook the most basic things!!! I love Chef Anne & her show, great recipes, but my favorite show is Giada At Home, yum!!
Making Ina Garten's (Barefoot Contessa) Chicken Chili for today's BIG game! Pats vs. Jets ... Will also indulge on some Chocolate from Cocoa Pod -- Ina & Brigitte are the best! http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cocoa-Pod-Chocolates/186182279787
I watched an episode of Secrets of a Restaurant Chef where Anne was making Meyer Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. I thought it looked like a recipe I'd actually try...
I made a turducken yesterday!! It was the first time I made one and maibe I'm even the first one to make a turducken in the Netherlands?? Check my page to see the pictures, it was beautiful and very tasty!

I am seriously disappointed in Chef Anne while watching "Worst Cooks in America." She really gave one of her people a hard time because he double dipped his spoon. Um, Chef Anne....You did the same thing on your show "Secrets of a restaurant chef!" I could not believe it when you did it, it was a dessert you were making! Now I am on a mission to find that episode, just for you to watch yourself! I was super surprised it was not edited out! Hopefully he does not get cut tonight because I WILL FIND THIS EPISODE FOR HIM TO ALSO WATCH!
wishing FN does not add any more iron chefs until current chefs retire as i have not seen enough of some of my favorite chefs lately!
You guys should probably edit the video of the challenger background from the Iron Chef episode you are playing now. You can see a cockroach running along the rim of the salad bowl next to the grill. Granted it's his restaurant in New York and not Kitchen Stadium but that's just disgusting.
CUPCAKES WITH TEQUILLA! YUMMMMMMM!
I watched and episode of DDD last week and saw Guy try some Cheeseburger soup, I watched very carefully when the restaurant owner made it, well I made my own version of that soup tonight, I followed the episode pretty closely and it was YUMMY! my husband and my boys, 8 and 10 yrs old, absolutely loved it. I will definitely be making that again.

Made Ina's "Parker's Beef Stew" for dinner last night--SOOOOO GOOD!!!!
I want to know how to make chicken curry roti...plz help.
I hear you guys are coming to Salt of the Earth in Fennville next week. Since you are in the area you should make a trip into Douglas and give Everyday People Cafe a try (www.everydaypeoplecafe.com). Matt Balmer (owner/chef) sure knows what he is doing! Both places are top picks with everyone in town!!
 Cuban Chicken Pizza is a dish the whole family will love. Find this recipe and many others at www.hispanicfoodnetwork.com & click on the Daily Dish tab. Enjoy!
who got booted last night off of worst cooks? I feel asleep Sigh 
I saw someone make homemade sauerkraut on a show. I don't know what show. I just remember seeing it and thinking...I want to try that. It was in the past week. Does anyone remember? 
On one of the Iron Chef (I think it was) shows, some vegetables, carrots and such were turned to "noodles" using a cutter with a crank handle. I am looking for that tool -- my wife is celiac and I need the thing. Anyone have a name or source?
Where does the cakes go on the challenges after they decide on a winner? There is no way a crew can eat a 3 foot cake!
Looking for a lasagna recipie that I think I saw on one of Guy Fieri's shows, but I am not sure. It was cooked in individual ramekins and they used eggplant rounds as one of the layers......Anyone remember this? I would love the recipe.
i think Duffs steak was the best on "Best thing I ever ate"
So I am watching the Best Food I Ever Ate... someone needs to tell Bobby Flay that the best burgers, are in fact, not served on a plate, but in a basket, wrapped in paper. He really needs to come to Red Mill Burgers in Seattle WA. I'll even buy him a creamsicle shake.
the best burger I ever ate was... the first time I ate a Big MAC, was in Nassau bahamas, I think the worker who made it was feeling alot of love on that day lol
I like the veggie-burger that Duff had on tonight's "The Best Thing I ever Ate". I like meat but hate the smell of cooking it. I am going to to try and duplicate that recipe.. We'll see, I guess...
you know me and my cooking!!!!! yumm chicken stuffed red peppers!
I'll be making a super pasta salad for the Super Bowl. Ingredients: rotini, balsamic dressing, roasted red peppers, chili peppers, salami, pepperoni. Everything was bought at Wolff's Flea Market, Chicago.
How about a Healthy cooking show, getting tired of the same calorie and fat filled shows over and over all day...
can i please have the recepie for alex's day off- potato pie. i caught the last part of the recepie and it looked soooo good! she made it in a cast iron skillet. i tried looking for it on food network website but didn't see it.
The low fat cheese cake looks delicious! My friend and I are learning how to cook and we are blogging about it and would love your support! Single Life 2 Married Wife P.S. We are trying to be healthy as well :)

Giada's Chicken Puff pastry Napoleans were pretty tasty!
Sampling some of Cocoa Pod Chocolates Valentine's Day Collection ... Passion Fruit, KirRoyal, MonCheri, Lavendar-Vanilla to name a few ... No wonder Brigitte was featured on The Barefoot Contessa -- her chocolates are amazing!! http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cocoa-Pod-Chocolates/186182279787
will y'all post the low fat cheesecake recipe again?
Loved tonight's episode of Cupcake Wars, but I'm really grossed out by the fact that 4 professionals in the food service industry were working around food with long, unrestrained hair. It's a miracle the judges didn't end up with at least one long hair in their cupcakes. Hope those bakers don't bake like that in their own commercial kitchens, unless they want to get cited by the health dept.
...I've given up on believing these cooking games...after Chopped, it shows rules don't mean anything. Basically, if the judges like the dessert, you can get away with using part of a whole. The example of using only a chicken breast from a whole chicken wasn't even a good one...it's all chicken...but when you're asked to use neopolitan ice cream, that means chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. Like the other chef said, if they wanted the chefs to only use vanilla, they would have put only vanilla in the basket....judges bend the rules for whoever they want. The final decision sucks!!!! 
Why is it every time over the last month my onscreen guide has said Ace of Cakes is on, some other show is on? I'm tired of setting my DVR and not getting what I want to watch!
Just a short holla to y'all at Food Network...I LOVE my new Food Network pressure cooker. I enjoy the speed and convenience of pressure cooking and this one is the EASIEST I've ever used! I love the option of two pressure settings and snap in pressure weight (no hunting for the weight)! Thanks for the awesome design!!!
Love every part of your shows EXCEPT Secrets of a Restaurant chef. She is so awkward in. Every way obnoxious and just plain the pits UGH wheb I see her on I turn the tv off. Until she's off then I am right back on with you guys!
The Food network is a commercial for the meat industry. Why do you think there are never vegetarian or vegan cooking shows? And no, it's not because there aren't enough non meat eaters to watch. 
 Food Network What's your top dish for fighting the winter chill? homemade from scratch Chili warms the tummy and soul on a cold winters night : )

Happy birthday Paula, thanks for teaching this obese country how to eat like crap. Very responsible of you.
Dear FN, My mother, who is now in the final stages of Alzheimer's, was in food service for many years as a dietitian & food service director for several nursing homes & hospitals (she also worked as a consultant for Aladdin's Temp-Rite division.) And how she loved to cook! Food has been her life, both professionally & as a hobby. For the past 14 years, your network has been her final connection to the food world. In the early stages of her dementia, she used to comment "what a nice boy" Bobby Flay was; she called Ming Tsai "Dan" for some unknown reason; she claimed she worked with Martha Stewart, and Emeril, of course, lived just down the street. LOL I just wanted to say "Thank you" for being there to help her (& us, her family) cope as this disease has progressed. 
Happy Birthday Paula Deen, Another year older and what do you get a pound of love and Butter.
Happy Birthday, How about some "BUTTER" cream frosting?? Have a great day.

Wanted to make butterscotch frosting so: I took Alton's Bourbon-Chocolate frosting and substituted butterscotch chips and vanilla extract. It was wonderful frosting!
Happy Born Date Paula!!!!! Love You And Your FOOD MMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!
while Restaurant:Impossible is good, are you guys really that out of ideas that you have to steal things from Gordon Ramsey (Kitchen Nightmares) and "Restaurant Makeover" on Wealth tv? how about some original ideas for 2011.
can you make an episode of best thing i ever ate "low fat, or low carb"
Happy Birthday to a beautiful lady Paula Deen**I love your show and tomorrow I'm making your carrot cake that you had on your show today. Mary Wyatt
Just watched Worst Cooks in America. Love the show, love the chefs... but I saw chef Anne Burrell jump all over Joshie about putting his spoon back in the salsa crudo. A couple weeks ago on Secrets of a Restaurant Chef, I watched her put a tasting spoon in a bowl after tasting with it, re-season, then pick up the same spoon out of the bowl and taste again. Not too fond of hypocrisy from the host. Still love ya, Anne, but give us all a break! If you are showing us secrets, follow your own rules. If they don't matter, don't come down on other people for following your own example!
Simply the BEST artisan Chocolatier! Watch Brigitte on The FoodNetwork's Barefoot Contessa! http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Valentine-s-Collection-from-Cocoa-Pod-Chocolates.html?soid=1102855344185&aid=gE6v75uvq9I

I just found this place on FB. Don't know why I didn't look for it before. I watch FN all the time. Love Top Chef, Chopped, and my favourite is Chefs vs City. Looking forward to scouring the Healthy section of this group.
Happy Birthday Paula Dean....hope ya have a yummy cake with BUTTER cream frosting!
Okay Ya'll I am absolutely in love with Down Home With The Neely's. They give me hope that Me and My Husband Michael can cook together, and make it out of the Kitchen alive. Plus they crack me up and they have a wide variety of Slammin Food!

I don't remember if I shared this... My daughter wanted to be Iron Chef Mike Symon for Halloween (and she told me I had to be Cat Cora). Here's the result: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=1740049&l=e72e7e7a99&id=1407891741
Does anyone watch the Cupcake Wars? Great show..good recipes. Except this week FN increased the number of recipes from 28 to 32 but didn't put the recipe in. Great network.
I feel like cooking with Wine...However, I only eat seafood . Any wine suggestions or recipes?? 
Tonight it's stuffed clams!!! Yummy Yum Yum!
Wanted something new, yet I wanted my stand-by; chicken. I'm gonna try this:
Please put Bobby's Throwdown back on at it's regular time on Wed. night - 8:00pm central time. As some one who attends church on Wed. evenings I would get home just in time to put on jammies and settle down with hubby for an hour of Throwdown. Now we're all messed up! 
does anyone have a reciepe for a cookie with dates and coconuts?????
I'm absolutely addicted to "Worst Cooks in America" because I can't tear myself away from the sheer ineptitude of these people! LOL
What's with the music in the background of the shows today? Has it always been there? Or am I just now hearing it. So annoying. Noticed it on Anne Burrell and The Neelys. They have such big personalities that you just don't need dubbed in bad music. I want to hear THEM talk, and cook.
Yummy tangy Spaghetti Squash hash. Try it! http://pointlessfood.blogspot.com/2011/01/spaghetti-squash-hash.html
This is for cooks that love to use pressure cookers but hate to wait for the steam to stop! My mother taught me to CAREFULLY take the pot to the sink and run cold water over it and the steam with stop quicker than leaving it on the stove and waiting. Bobby Flay was having to wait a long time, but this is quicker and easier! Much love for the chefs!!!!!
Ackee&saltfish with roast breadfruit, yummy try this!

am i the only one that feels condescended to by FN shows? ever since i've watched next food network star i can't help but notice how the chefs all seem to b following the same direction given to the star wannabees...telling us about their personal lives so i feel connected n engaged...whatever! julia child never told me 'bout her family n neither did the galloping gourmet. i want to see recipes...i don't care 'bout the kneely's sex life or their kids...don't want to watch ina being the world's most pretentious hamptonite...n i'm soooo sick of guy n hunter. i like nigella, n mario, n even emeril cos they tell me about the food, the preparation n the process. i don't need to b wowed or sucked in...i'm already watching...for now.
I love experimenting with food on the weekends... Taking traditional foods and making something brilliant with them... Thanks FN!
Rise and shine FN... wondering why the changes in the lineup and doubling up on shows??? then moving folks like Aaron to early morning ?
spagetti squash and granny smith apples.........Delicious
I'm making apple pork stew for dinner tonight and I was planning on adding butternut squash to it but I can't seem to find any, including frozen, at the grocery store. Is there something else I can add to it that would be a good substitute?
Did Anne Burrell just say she was gonna "brown the crap" out of her pureed vegetables until they turn into "brown crud"?? YUM!!! LMAO!!!!
Can we do the same Pasta Recipe The Barefoot Contessa did today Gluten Free? Thanks.
Would be nice to see more shows about healthier dishes. Most are just based on taste only with no regard for eating healthier. 
Check out Graciela's Cakes! Beautiful classic cakes with a modern twist.
Looove the cupcake wars 
What has happened to the Food Network? It has become one big contest and reality show. And the judges on some of these shows are quite, well, "judgemental". You would think they were paying the contestants with their own money. And some of the crap in those food baskets on "Chopped" are just ridiculous. I do like Triple D. At least I get to see some inovative cooking and some interesting people.
Well, I am watching the Wild Chef and he went to a farm and it showed them force feeding the geese for Foie Gras.... I was shocked to see that long tube forced down the goose's neck.... I am totally disgusted.... Torture plane and simple
Regarding Big Daddy's House show, what happened to his show that comes on Sundays at 1:30 EST every Sunday? However, I found him on Saturday at 8:00 am EST. What happened? Is that Food Networks way of considering canceling his show? Just curious.

Can we give shout outs to fabulous places to eat? LOL. I have no affiliation they're just THAT good!! http://www.mama-soup.com/
I just made Barefoot Contessa's granola bars for the 4th time. I love all of the ideas I get from her show. I take her idea and then make the dish my own. I don't ever follow a receipe exactly after the first time I make it (and only sometimes the first time.) These bars are chewy and have great shelf life. I always make 3 times the receipe and share them with friends and family. I am waiting for the 3 hours in the turned off oven to bring them out and cut them. My house smells great! Thanks Ina. Send our love to your Jeffrey. He's a lucky man!
Super excited about your new show RECIPE TO RICHES! Way to go Food Network! Finally a show where we get to chose the best recipe in Canada and get it on grocery shelves! Long live the butter tart! I saw more info is on www.recipetoriches.ca

I just made the cheeseburger soup that was on "Triple D". It was delicious! I also made Jalapeno Cornbread and some wings fried in duck fat. YUMMY!
i saw ace of cakes...SO AMAZING!!!! <3 
Very disappointed in Restaurant: Impossible. It's obviously a rip-off of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. Shame on you!
I only got a little bit of Rachel Ray's new show--making 5 meals for the week--and I was intrigued by a potato, pea, pancetta soup. However, I can't find the recipe anywhere on food network. Can anybody help me? Thanks!
Made grilled Cheeseburgers, jalapeno brats, hot dogs and deep fried cheese and fried dill pickles today. Sounds like a lot but will feed the two of us for a couple of days!

Alton Brown...call kitchen stadium The Colosseum...Iron Chef gladiators fighting it out for the Caesar Chairman...
watching Worst Cooks right now... I am going to try Chef Roberts turkey recipe.
I made Chef Anne Burrell's Eggs Flamenco for dinner last night, had to make a couple substitutions to the recipe because I couldn't find everything here in my small town but it turned out AWESOME! I will definitely be making this again. I used white extra sharp cheddar instead of manchego, was a good sub, and I only had mexican chorizo available, instead of the spanish one so it ended up browned like ground beef instead of the diced cubes she had, and I baked it in some ramekins that I had instead of the terra cotta dishes. All in all it still ended up being really good.
 Chorizo Bean & Cheese Nachos from the Hispanic Food Network are game day perfect. Grab the recipe at www.hispanicfoodnetwork.com & click on the Daily Dish tab. Thanks!

I thought I saw something on one of the shows late last night (maybe just dreaming) but they showed a place in NY where you could get a chicken skin sandwich. Apparently you bake the chicken skin until it's really crisp like bacon and make a chicken, lettuce & tomato sandwich. Sounds interesting...anyone have a recipe or know if I really saw it?
More shows on how to make different cakes than a lot of shows featuring decorating cakes. 
I was very disappointed that you got the city wrong when you featured my local ball park on Unwrapped - Fifth-Third Ballpark is in Comstock PARK, MI, not Comstock (totally different city).

Thank you for recording (and playing back) Guy's Big Bite in true HD widescreen format! The fisheye look to stretch the screen to fit the wide screen format on the other programs hurts the eyes. It also makes the people and items near the far left and right borders of the screen look extra-wide. Not very flattering...

I'm watching cake challenge right now. And as a cake decorator I find it quite funny that these decorators act like they have no idea how to transport/move a cake. I have yet to make a cake that is going to be eaten in my shop. 
woooooo chef james on chopped gooooo!!!
I am watching Chopped and very disappointed. First round thEy cut a chef bcause he weNt to his comfort zone; but let's keep the chef that served raw dough and a hair on her fish. HORRIBLE AND UNFAIR!!!!!

I having trouble watchinmg the Neelys, interested in the recipes, but cannot stand how they act. 
I'm having trouble opening the Food Network website but I'm DYING to make Giada's White Bean Chicken Chili...can someone please share the recipe, if they have it?
I need Guy Fieri to come to a joint in Knoxville,TN for the BEST BURGER EVER!!!! Can't find a spot on his FB to post or on your website to send a suggestion.
OK...I have a recipe that calls for 1 cup of "Sweet Fresh Milk"....what the heck it that?
Let's hear it from TEAM CHEF JAMES from last night's Chopped!! Okay, so maybe he was a bit of a jerk, but he IS a chef and a graceful winner, and his competition was a SORE LOSER who cut herself either because she has poor knife skills or couldn't produce under pressure (or both). 
Iron chef america is the best!! Just the iron chefs always win! it would be nice to see the challenger win sometimes!
Food Network, I think you should do a story about our state's only 5-Diamond dining establishment which, it has been announced today, will be converting into a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse franchise this fall. We in Grand Rapids, Michigan will miss our beloved 1913 Room at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel, the jewel of our city's culinary establishments.

I just made the Green bean recipe for dinner tonight from Paula's show today and it was WONDERFUL!! I can't wait to make it again for company.
Just wanted to give a high five to Chef Anne Burrell. I have just started culinary school and her show is jam packed with helpful information. 
What has happened to Robin Millers show. That was my relaxing ritual in the morning to take a break from cleaning and watch her. You use to have her on in the afternoon and then moved her and now I can't find her on anymore. I haven't seen Ellie on much either. These are great cooks that give you health options for cooking. Would love it also if you guys had a day dedicated to some of the original programs you started with. Like a Food Network Classics day. 
Bring "Good Eats" back to prime time, I'm begging you
so for the corn pudding... 4 ears of corn, cut off the cob. 2 eggs, 4 egg yolks. 1 c. sugar. I qt heavy cream. about 2 table spoons fresh turmeric. 5 whole Coquitos, 4 broken into pieces. 1/4 c. mascarpone cheese. 2 TBL Armagnac. steep the cream with the coquitos and the turmeric. combine the sugar and the eggs. strain the steeped cream into the egg/sugar mixture. return to heat, add corn. stirring constantly simmer until thickened. allow to cool. mix in the mascarpone and the Armagnac, pour into cups. top with sweetened mascarpone, empanada crisps (baked with butter and sugar) use the last coquitos and with a micro plane shred the coquitos onto the top, mint leaf garnish. granted i didn't measure anything but i think its close. the corn has a lot of starch so don't thicken too much. I also thought of putting it into the ice cream machine they had... another time.
Watchin Worst cooks of America let me just say Robert nd Ann are AWESOME!!!!
I'm sorry, who's idea is it to take people who have zero training on how to cook and then ridicule them because they don't do a good job? Maybe I should give my 6 year old a calculus exam after 10 minutes of instruction and then make fun of him for failing. What a ridiculous show.
Check out Graciela's Cakes and see what you think! Please give Miss Grace a like on her fb page!!!
Add Black Bean Tomatillo Dip from the Hispanic Food Network to your Superbowl Party menu. You don't want to miss this tasty twist on a classic dip, even your chips will thank-you! Find the recipe at www.hispanicfoodnetwork.com & click on the Daily Dish tab. Enjoy!
Mr. & Mrs. P's Picadillo Picadillo is our easy go-to meal when we are too busy to even think about what we are going to make for dinner. Our Miami fans are very familiar with this dish and probably already have their own recipe that has been passed down from generation to generation. http://cristyandmichael.blogspot.com/2011/01/cuban-ground-beef-dish-picadillo.html
I liked the old Food Network. Just cannot get used to all the "contests." Does any watcher really learn more about food preparation by watching this stuff?
Find out how to make delicious maple pecan bread - it's a perfect breakfast treat! http://whiskiebusiness.blogspot.com/2011/01/maple-pecan-bread.html
I love Food Network, but I'm confused about something. Why is Ace of Cakes cancelled and where is David Lieberman these days?
tried your flatbread pizzeta from Chef Irvine from Restauant Impossible...was wicked good just would like to know how many calories is in it as he made it. Actually would like to know if you can start putting things like that on your website?
slow cooker pork tacos are awsome..... a must try for all who love to use your crock pots!!!!!!

Spending this morning cooking up some roaster chickens - desperately need to restock all of the chicken vegetable soups/stews I had while being stuck at home sick... Ive got Gahhhhhlic-Herb, my own blended Sweet/Heat BBQ spice rub, and a southwestern chipotle rub... now if only I could smell everything cooking! LOL
Sunday's Parade had a Jamie Oliver recipe in it called Tray Baked Chicken. Outstanding! I highly recommend it! I used legs and thighs instead of breasts.
Got a pasta maker for Christmas, anyone have any tips for preserving pasta so I can make a big batch and keep some instead of making a big mess at least once a week? Feel free to msg me!
Please vote for my daughter! http://www.brickfish.com/Pages/PhotosAlbums/PhotoView.aspx?picid=1273448_67635154&pid=4670179&scid=593
Love Down Home with The Neelys! 
Thank you food network/travel channel, if not for you two i would not have thought to add raisins and cayenne pepper to my standard PB&J. Bacon and bananas I know are yummy. Fried Bologna is good too. But the combo of sweet, salty and spicy is killer. I suggest all my friends, without a nut allergy, try something new with their PB&J. ASAP!
For some reason, I'm having trouble getting recipes and pages on the website to load. I keep getting errors. Am I the only one? Just wondering
I just made the Zucchini pancakes and they were divine!! 
yesterday made a batch of Neely's BBQ Sauce my family loves it. They want me to can it soon..........
I love Food Network, watch it all the time. But today I was so disappointed watching the end of Barefoot Contessa's All Aboard Episode and they were using the American Flag as a tablecloth! This is so disrespectful! 
Home made spaghetti sauce !!
Apple Cream cheese cinnamon rolls from scratch.....Yummy!
MY favorite show WAS CHOPPED. I say WAS because for the 2nd time this week you chose the wrong person to win. Every dish she made someone found a problem. You chopped talent and rewarded a smug clueless person and she didn't follow the rules. No more CHOPPED for me.
Just made the Neely's Kale Chips.....!!!! YUM!
Please Check out our website,Mammaw Neal's gourmet seasonings, dips,and catering. www.mammawneals.net
ok......so after a dream last night I feel compelled to share it with food network because i think the world is ready for this idea for a food network reality show!!! it would be called "Cooking with the Stars"!!! the chefs would be Stay-at-home-moms and dads, maybe a server in a restaurant that enjoys cooking, just everyday people that like to cook....that would make a great show! I would love to be on that!!!! my hubby tells me all the time i'd make a great chef one day....i think that would be a great premise for a show. of course, if someone takes this idea and runs with it and im not invited to be on the show, i would be very disappointed!!! LOL!!!!! here is a challenge food network!! 
REALLY missing Ellie Krieger NOW... any plans to bring another HEALTHY chef on board??? Specially on a weekend like this for games?
The Cupcake Wars skeeve-fest is on now. It isn't just that they make them for the judges but the winner makes ONE THOUSAND... that is an awful lot of people to expose to hair in the batter. 
you guys need to get a new host on Cupcake Wars. he's annoying and makes reli dumb comments. Please! the show would b 10 times better without him
I agree: the cupcake bakers need to TIE THE HAIR BACK!!!
I am Food Network's biggest FAN! Is there anyone else who watches nothing but FN? If I could pay for just one channel it would be FN! :) Best shows on T.V.!!! Getting hungry now...what's for dinner? 
I have a question - that one contestant (Stevie) on Food Network Challenge - if you so dislike Kerry Vincent, why bother entering the competition? I've never seen her win, and her "creations" are so awful, I cannot believe anyone would pay money for them. It seems she comes on just to be outrageous or argumentative. 
For those of you who love to cook, ck out this site. It's free to join. you can find recipies from shows or from their vast amount of viewers & chefs. You can creat a recipie box that you can save your favorites to and when you need one its at your finger tips. Love the site and it's very user friendly. 
What happened to Big Daddy's House? It's moved from Sundays to Saturday mornings. That feels like a death sentence.
Did Sunny Anderson really just tell a story about finding a pearl in a MUSSEL?!?!?!?!? Come on!!!!!!!!! lol
The three personalities I hate most on this channel: 1) Rachel Ray, 2) Pat and Gina Neely, 3) Paula Dean
I entered the Food Network Pasta Recipe Sweepstakes. Upon entering my recipe which was supposed to be "FREE", I was hit with a subscription of 10 issues for $15 and billed. If I was not in financial distress, I would have considered it a great buy however, the moral of the story is that a sweepstakes without restrictions should not bill me for subscriptions I did not request. That is the only FLAW, I found and will discontinue the sweepstakes.
Sick of same shows over and over. What happened to Tyler Florence. And Michael Chiarello. Miss. Miss them. Get them back. Get Reggie on too!
Watching Food Landscapes...It seems to me that there are enough Chefs in America that could compete without having Stevie and her disrespectful arrogance. Where is the professionalism? Her behavior toward the female judge was awful...The two men's teams were wonderful even when one lost...there was respect
Kitchen Stadium Nickname...."The Pig House" instead of Michigan Stadium's "The Big House".....go blue.

Just a comment, the assistant Erin on Iron Chef last night, appeared to taste the food and put the spoon back in the container--at least twice. If she had been on CHOPPED she would have been sent home.
NFL star Kris Jenkins wanted a game-day party catered by the Worst Cooks recruits. We wonder if Kris knew exactly what he was getting in to: http://ow.ly/3Ni3z.
I loveeeedd last nights Challenge. Stevie needs to get her head out of her butt and she could really be a competitor. I really like when they do something other than cakes!
Hi, does anyone have a recipe for potat pancakes without using eggs?
I just watched DDD - "A Little Twisted" and was very disappointed at the Anchor Bar / Superior WI segment - Did Guy even GO there or did they just send a camera crew? There was no cookin' in the kitchen - just showed a bunch of emails and burgers and customers... Not what I expect from this show at all! 
Love the Spegettii and turkey meatball rescipe from this month, problem though, it needs more Garlic and fresh herbs. other than that amazing
I sort of enjoy watching Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives on Food Network........ BUT someone should tell Guy Fieri while he's in the kitchens to keep his filthy meathooks OFF the food that they're cooking in those restaurants. Am I the only one that thinks it's repugnant? RR
http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/honey-mustard-and-red-onion-barbecued-chicken-recipe/index.html Tasty!! We made a salad of baby arugula, red pepper, red onion, pear, balsamic, EVOO and a little salt to go with it. Excellent dinner!!
Hi I found a way to keep my cookbook neat and mint. I scanned the book into my portable netbook and use it as acookbook when in the kitchen. Did you ever think of a DVD version of the cookbook. I treasure my book and do not want the book to get messed up.
Just wanted to stop by and say THANK YOU Meredith!! LOVE my Technique Hard Anodized Dishwasher-Safe pots and pans!!! Before I "knew to" love hard anodized? I did! My daughter has a couple of hard anodized pans that I probably bought close to 25 years ago!!! They are still going strong, as I know my Technique ones will too!!! BakE Well my friend!!!
Have a technique set and love them...and have picked up a couple of other pieces to add to the set!! Thanks for the Technique line, it's the BEST!!
Hi Meredith, I had purchased 2 sets of silicone baking sheets perhaps 2 yrs ago? Just started using them during the Fall & love them. My cookies turned out so nice & evenly baked like no other sheet I had ever used before. I have the small size & see the only lrg size is sold in a set with other pieces. I'm sold on silicone!
You, and Technique, Rock! We just bought a set of the dishwasher-safe anodized and love them! I'm a diehard stainless steel cookware devotee but wanted a really good set of non-stick... found it! Love your recipes...thanks for making we nowhere-near condon bleu types feel empowered and brave in the kitchen. :D
I am so excited, finally ordered my 5 qart cassarole baker in blue and green squares. I wanted it ever since it was on but the lady told me it was sold out. I was lookng at the web site and got it on clearance and free shipping and handling. Cannot wait for it to come home. Your book rocks. Everyone cannot believe how tasty the dinners are. I am a good cook but your book is making me a great one. I started playing with the recipies a little changing a little here and there. So far they are delicious. The cheese cake is still my favorite lol
Just got your cookbook the recipes look wonderful. Is that your doggie in the picture with you in front? Very cute.
Hi Meredith, Your roast on David's show, is your recipie in your book? It looked delicious.
Meredith... do you have a recipe for Hot & Sour Soup? My tummy is craving this and I dont want to order it out. I want to monitor what is put into it.
My compliments to the chef.
Hey Meredith, I've been pondering your problem with David and brussel sprouts. Maybe it's the bitterness he doesn't like. I've par-boiled them for a few minutes in chicken broth and then saute'd them in balsamic and some onions. I was never one to like them either, until I did this.
Hi Meredith, try mixing the brussel sprounts with cheese and topping a pizza with it.
Feel like making a heart warming meal during these snowy days? Check out my latest blog post on QVC.com. 
Great Brussels ideas! Thank you. Check out the show today. I'll be giving Brussels Sprouts another chance around 2 o'clock today. Fingers crossed! Don't tell David, but I'm giving him Brussels Sprouts CHIPS!

hello there! I'm hoping Facebook gets checked on a more timely manner than email :) I sent an email regarding sponsorship. could someone pass the message along? thanks!
I've been receiving meals all week as part of a Groupon deal. Just want to say that I'm VERY impressed! Everything is delicious!
Tip of the Day: Alkalize. How and Why? To alkalize, eat more leafy green vegetables and add fresh lemon or lime to your water. By doing this, you will lower inflammation and PH levels which in turn raises Growth Hormone Levels. An easy way to feel better, get leaner and improve your health!
Good Luck to Metabolic Meals client Tyron Woodley who will be fighting in the Strikeforce Main event tonight on Showtime!
Did you know that Metabolic Meals uses a strategy called "carb cycling"? By alternating days of low carbs and days with specific amounts of low glycemic/gluten free carbs you will improve insulin sensitivity and improve thyroid function. What does this mean for our customers? Better Immune System, less bodyfat, more muscle and more energy!
Tip of the Day: Consume 50g of protein before noon! This simple task can improve body composition and energy levels. People that eat high amounts of protein early in the day are less likely to crave sugar later.
Fertilizers have been know to block nutrient absorption. One of the many reasons to buy organic!
If your urine has a pungent smell after eating Asparagus, then this is a sure sign that you are a poor Methylator and have possible mutations in the MTHFR gene. This can cause an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and make detoxification difficult. Here is a supplement that we have seen help several clients with this problem: http://us.cpoliquin.com/product_p/methylator%20plus%203.0.htm 
Want to know if your multivitamin is good quality? Check to see which form of magnesium is used. If it says magnesiun oxide, it's not a good brand. Mag is an expensive mineral and means they probably used other poor ingredients as well. A good multi will contain high levels of zinc and mag in chelate forms as well as a nice base of anti oxidants Vit A,C and mixed forms of Vit E. 
We often talk about the benefits of reducing inflammation. The spice turmeric contains a phytochemical called curcumin that lowers inflammation as much as NSAIDS without the side effects. It also is great for heart health, detoxification and has anti-cancer properties.
For people who love potato chips here is a healthy alternative: Take 4 cups of kale and pat dry. Cut into thin slices and apply a thin coat of olive oil. From there place on cookie sheets and place in an oven at 350 degrees. Cooking times will vary so keep a close eye. Kale is done when its crispy. Add sea salt for flavor.
Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity(orac) is a measurement we look at when deciding what fruits and vegetables go into our meal plan. The higher the score, the more that food helps in fighting free radicals and keeping you healthy.
If your diet looks like this- Protein: grassfed beef, wild caught fish, poultry, free range eggs Carbs: leafy greens, berries, broccoli, cauliflower Fats: nuts, olive oil, coconut oil You are most likely lean, strong and can't remember the last time you've been sick.
Tip of the day: Replace your Dairy Milk with Almond Milk. Almond Milk is less allergenic for most people and does not spike insulin like milk(especially skim). This is a healthier alternative and will also help improve body composition

Does anyone know..... do Llamas eat blueberry plants?
As our new Congress convenes and hopefully begins the process of downsizing the bloated Federal government, here is a timely reminder of what can happen if we don't succeed.
The games begin anew on Wednesday . . .
About all that nice, nice political discourse -- just Keeping it real . . .
John Green, the father of the 9-year-old Tucson shooting victim displays great courage, poise and appreciation for our country's freedoms. Our thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family, and to the families of all the other victims.
Steele dropped out of the race; Priebus is the new Republican Party chairman ...
Reince Priebus, chairman of the Wisconsin GOP, is considered the front-runner in the race. Politico says Priebus is the first choice of 32 RNC members. Also running are former Missouri GOP chairwoman Ann Wagner; ex-Michigan GOP chairman Saul Anuzis, who lasted through five rounds of balloting in the race that Steele won in 2009; and former deputy RNC chairwoman Maria Cino, who has the backing of top Republicans suc
87% of us (likely voters) now view the economy as a Very Important issue, the most important issue . . . will the Obama administration listen this time?
This is not the type of political discourse we tolerate in America . . . looks like there may have been another person involved as well: http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-0110-gabrielle-giffords-20110110,0,6628193.story
The two wealthy brothers who control Koch Industries host a retreat for major-player Conservatives to discuss how to save our government and our country from the resulting deficit from all the massive spending by Washington . . . naturally, out here in CA that didn't go over too well with hundreds of environmentalists, union members and liberal activists.
It's never been more important to "know" what your kids are watching and being exposed to on their TVs, computers and smart phones . . .
We want to keep these 2,400 Americans in our thoughts and prayers as they try to get out of the turmoil that is now Egypt . . .
The Left jumped on the "blame Palin & the Tea Party" meme. "Even The New York Times joined the fray, reporting on the Palin map in its initial coverage, and running a Paul Krugman blog post blaming right-wing rhetoric." Congresswoman Giffords was one of the few Democrats that took part in the reading of the Constitution on the House floor last week . . .

I don't understand how as a college-educated young professional that I cannot get approved for a card. I have never been late on a car or rent payment in my life. Yet, Discover tells me that I cannot be a member even after sending multiple mailers claiming that I am "pre-approved". As a marketing professional, I have always respected Discover's commitment to customer service and fairness. After being "rejected," I cannot say that I share this feeling any longer. Not sure what you have to do to be a member, but apparently being a 20-something professional with a solid income and a good credit history isn't good enough. Discover FAIL! 
I'm still trying to figure out how to make mortgage payments with my discover card.
I love my Discover. It's so thick and shiny.
Earlier today, one of your agent called me to offer me a new credit card. I politely interrupted her pitch and asked her to take me off your calling list. She just hung up on me, without any further comment. Nice. 2 hours later, right before 9pm -not sure about you but I do not like being solicited right before 9pm- I get another call from another of your agents offering me exactly the same service. In the same polite tone I told her what had happen to me and asked her again very politely to take me off your freaking calling list. This annoyed me so much that I decided to share this story with your 26K "fans". Sure you might not be able to control every single of your calling agents, but it really poorly reflects on you and you brand. So guess what credit card brand I'm not going to subscribe to in the future. You'll probably remove this post, but I feel a personal gratification sharing this on your FB page knowing that at least a few people will read it before you remove it. 
Why would you be running an update at this time of day? This makes me a little nervous. Needs some answers here.
I'm sure you've heard enough of this but I've been trying to access Discover since last night via my iPhone app and the website now that I'm at work today. Not good; can't even call to access my account. I just got a letter from you all and I'd like to be proactive with my account but this is a big barrier...
I have requested that NO "convenience checks be sent to my house. I opened my latest Discover mailbox filling "advertisement" and WOW: four more convenience checks. Do I have to cancel my account to get them to stop sending me these? My Bank of America Visa stopped immediately (two weeks) but these clowns have been doing this for six months! 
I was told the system should be back up after 4 eastern time. I just tried it twice and it still isn't up. Any more recent news as to when it will be up? Payments have to be posted by 5 pm EST and I don't want to be charged a late fee.
I just want to say I love my discover card. I had a computer crash and just spent the last two days resurrecting my financial transactions for the last year so I can be ready for tax time. Discover was the only institution out of the 7 I had to deal with that saved more than 3 months worth of information AND let me downloaded it in an intelligent, super quick and easy manner. So they may be having a bad day but let me tell you they more than make up for it with all they do every day. Thanks Discover you rock!!!!
please have a rep contact me as this is just not fare
I am a recent new comer to the discover card family, I would just like to take the time to thank Discover for giving me the opportunity to have a card. The customer service was great. One person I would Like to thank is Bruce. He works in the credit approval department. He actually took the time to call me to make sure it was me that applied for the card, He was very kind and understanding. I look forward to being a discover card holder for many years Thank you Discover Deborah Wells

I don't think I could begin to discribe how much I LOVE my Discover account. Discover has helped me in so many ways without the crazy amount of fees other businesses charge! Also, when I call in, I talk to an agent that is right here in the states. No hassel with trying to understand what the agent is telling me. Thanks Discover!
Check out event pics from our Discover Orange Bowl Patrol, Matt and Jeff.
"Thank you for calling. This is Peggy. You have problem?"
THANK you so much for helping us work out problems without fees, when our mail -- including 3 bills from different 3 companies -- didn't get delivered over 3 months in this small town. Every once in a while our rural post office goes -- well -- postal, and the nice people on the phones helped fix the problem! <3 Good people, Discover.
I am totally appauled by the service I have received this last week. I am a ex employee and a 5 year customer. Never been late on a payment. I actually never call into customer service. Discover took my payment out of the wrong account after I got a confirmation from Discover that I changed my bank account information. It over drew the account. I have gone through the ringer all this week for a refund!!!! Discover charges more than that for a late fee! I use my card for all my bills making Discover huge amounts of money, considering Discover charges way more than Visa/Mastercard to business owners. I am shocked. I never treated customers like then when I worked for Discover. Guess things have changed and you all have enough customers...you dont need good ones. So sad. I am fighting the $27 credit and closing my account. Even after 5 faxes of proof that it was a Discover Error. Wow.
Discover, I do love you, but...as I opted for going paperless, a small step that makes a huge difference in going green, I am baffled by the amount of promotional mail that I get from you. I check my PO box 3 times a week and out of the 20 pieces of mail i get, 19 are discover...I'm disappointed and honestly tired of the useless mailings. 
Love my 300 free pay fish for RC. 
Heads up, on the Credit ScoreTracker page at the top it has the orange button that says "Get Your Score" and text reads "For just $5.99/month!" and at the bottom of the page is has the orange button and text reads "For just $7.99/month!"
I was just approved for a discover card. How long does it take to receive it?
Just received my Discover Card yesterday, They we soo cool, They sent my card Via Next Day Air. How many Credit card companies do that. Don't be a Hater, Be a Lover<3
Be Warned: My father has had a Discover Card for 25 years found out that only certain benefits added through the years apply to his card. The extended warranty protection was not added to his card. I understand that the terms of the card change, but they give him some of the new perks but not others? The CS said he could cancel the card and reapply if that benefit is offered now. Now That Is Customer Retention!
I have a simple question....in the commercial where the guy (looks like Robert Wuhl) is checking on reward redemption....who is that? My brother swears it is Robert Wuhl, but I know it is not.

Heya! Tasty Kitchen has the love for Bacon Jam today!
Duck, duck, duck, duck... No goose. One lovely duck broken down into trimmed breasts (and salt curing in the fridge) for duck prosciutto, two leg-and-thigh portions salted and herbed and garlicked in the fridge for duck confit, all the trimmings and skin rendering for duck fat for the forementioned confit, a carcass roasting for stock... AND offal for the tiniest pt ever.
Interestingly, when reading labels on Kellogg's All-Bran cereal (an integral ingredient in a bran muffin recipe I've been making for years) this past weekend, I found to my dismay that all versions (flakes, sticks, etc...) contained High Fructose Corn Syrup. Big, fat bummer! (Which is, incidentally, what HFCS will do to you eaten in excess.)
I am now officially on the bacon jam bandwagon.
The perfect solution to a fast, hot, nutritious breakfast. Mix up ahead of time, bake and serve!
The Bacon Jam is getting some serious love today, friends. evil chef mom and I pinky swear it's worth your time!
Please make a batch of my healthy bran muffins to make up for what I'm about to post tomorrow and Friday. Thank you.
Might I suggest you all take a moment to hide your calorie count books? I'm just looking out for you. Tune in at 10 EST for details.
I kept writing 'poopcorn' instead of 'popcorn' while writing today's column. Good thing my eagle-eyed Record-Eagle editor is proofing it before it goes to press!
evil chef mom and I are planning some seriously evil cross posts on Monday. Bacon Jam. I told you it's evil.
This counts as a recipe? Really? What have *I* been toiling at all these years?
Another suggestion for those of you who made the Bacon Jam. It's pretty darned good on a baked potato with some homemade pimiento cheese!
I surely won't win any awards for my fondant work, but I'm pleased that I made the fondant myself and that the cake actually bears a resemblance to the TARDIS. But best of all is that my birthday boy *adores* his cake!
Knife meet salt. Salt meet duck.
Der... that is to say. "Knife meet duck. Duck meet salt." And adding Rebecca meet caffeinated tea.

How is it looking for strawberry picking over the weekend? 
hey jen! Just wondering if you guys have a girl scout troop already scheduled to see cookies up there? pls get back to me! jen:brooklyns bowtique
We drove from Aventura, and it was the best thing we ever did. Twice the quality, 1/3rd the price of WFM or FM. This is the way produce shopping should be for everyone. Can't wait to try the BBQ - Porky & Beth seem to really know "low and slow".
we had a nice dinner party and the fresh produce from Bedners was the key. The corns was fabulous, fresh string beans a delight and the strawberries and blackberries a wonderful dessert. Thanks!
strawberry fields tomorrow?? please say yes!
The onion is back!
Are the strawberry u-pick fields open this weekend?
Will there be any Strawberry picking Monday?
A BIG thank you to Bedner's for hosting a very successful event for National Adoption Weekend! 4 different rescues had dogs & cats adopted and so many more will follow through this week from pets they met this weekend. For those not ready to adopt, a few signed up to become foster families. On behalf of the pups, kitties, families, and Life with Dogs Fund a heartfelt thank you!!
how does strawberry picking look for this weekend?
What time is the strawberry upick open tomorrow?

Loved our day at your farm today!!! We picked berries, tomatoes, green peppers and beautiful sunflowers~Couldn't believe the stalks were only $1.50, they are full of blooms & flowers! We also enjoyed some wonderful BBQ & roasted corn. We picked up a jar of homemade jam, an old fashioned lollypop & called it a day....we will keep returning. So happy to of found you after moving from SC where upicks are plentiful. Next time we're going to try some of that old fashioned ice cream as well..loved seeing the tractor motor churn those old hand churns!
just came back from your Farm it was Fantastic !! cant wait to go back next week!!
The dog adoption is in full swing. They will be here until 3:00. They have sooo many cute puppies. Please give them a good home. ;)
We started picking our onion this morning. It is so delicious. Try it and you'll be hooked.
Strawberry upick closed again but you can still pick tomatoes and sunflowers.
We now have tangelos in stock. This member of the citrus family is known for the juice that it provides. A ripe tangelo is filled with much more juice than pulp. In terms of flavor, a tangelo tastes much like a tangerine.
A Girl Scout will be selling those delicious cookies Saturday & Sunday. Hurry while supplies last.
The strawberry u-pick field is closed again, but feel free to come out and pick tomatoes!
Starting Friday we will be carrying a delicious, locally made hummus. We hope you will try it!

I am pretty upset with O'reilly!! I was just informed that all of the warranties on my Crewline tools I bought at Checker auto, (before O'reilly bought them out) are no longer valid. I have been using these things for over 15 years because they were inexpensive, and if I lost one I wouldn't be too disappointed. Sorry O'reilly, I am done shopping with your company.

We first came across your soup at the Commissary whwere we are stationed at Ft. Carson, CO. We tried the Creamy Tomato and the Creamy Tomato and Roasted Red Pepper. Both were good but my favorite is the CT. I have to say, it is really the best creamy tomato soup I've ever tasted! Sweet and a little savory, I loved it!! The Comm doesn't sell it much so we'll probably go to Whole Foods. Anyway, thanks for a delicious, locally grown, organic soup! I'm from the PNW so it's local to me. <3
I had the Thai Sweet Potato soup today. I used an immersion blender and turned it into a creamy soup. Yum!
So I tried your enriched soy milk for the first time today and it was delicious! I plan on buying more as soon as possible. I usually don't really like soy milk but this I'll drink any time. And I like that it has protein and vitamins. It's something I can drink in the morning that will help me get the day started.
: My daughter & I had your cashew carrot ginger soup for dinner tonight. It's wonderful!!
I useed to get your white bean soup and the ham and split pea soup at my local safeway, Giant food, and Harris Teeter groc store. I cannot find these soup flavors anywhere anymore. do you still make them?
My husband, a born and bred meat and potatoes guy, has fallen in love with your Carrot Cashew Ginger soup! Thank You!
I'm so sad that your teas are no longer carried at my local Harris Teeter :( I love to take the green-peach and green-tangerine teas to work
The college I went to used to have the best tomato soup. In the 10 years since I've been out of school I haven't been able to find a tomato soup I like much less one that comes close to my old favorite... till I tried your Creamy Tomato! It's now my new favorite!
Are your soups vegetarian?
Pacific Natural Foods, I'm VERY pleased to learn your tetra pak is BPA free! NICE!! Now, if you guys will just produce and package tomato paste, I'd be set! :) Again, love your stuff, oh and ALL our Thanksgiving and Christmas meals made with your condensed soups turned out wonderfully! Keep up the fantastic work. 
I'm cutting out diary and just tried your Almond Milk in my coffee. Can't believe how much better than my half and half it is! Love it.
My kids and I LOVE your organic tomato and red pepper soup!
Just had your Chipotle Sweet Potato soup...Oh my!!!So good....
The most amazing, creamy soup!
They have a great selection of non-dairy beverages. My favorites are the soy, almond and rice milks.
Can i heat up your simply coffee vanilla latte? It says iced coffee, any one ever tried hot?

I am so grateful that you make low sodium alternatives (broths) that are delicious too. Pacific is my favorite brand.
I love the chicken stock in the 8oz. cartons. They are perfect for cooking for two. Thanks so much!
Love the organic broths
Tried your Curried Red Lentil Soup today......LOVE!!
If you or someone you love is on sodium restriction, Pacific Natural Foods has an organic sodium reduced chicken broth with only 70 mgs of sodium. This is much lower that a lot of the others.
Hi, I LOVE your soups. Just wondering, are the cartons recyclable?
I LOVE your low-sodium chicken stock! I have it in my pantry at all times!
The Roasted Red Pepper-Tomato soup is my very favorite of all brands of soups. My complaint: Costco only stocks your soups in the Fall season. We should be able to buy it ALL YEAR LONG from Costco.
Love the non-dairy milks.
Absolutely LOVE your soups... since I become a vegetarian they've been a go-to staple for me. I'm in love with the Southwestern Vegetable.
The THAI SWEET POTATO soup is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! <3
My daughter & I love your soups! You don't need to had a thing to enjoy them as they're perfectfly seasoned. We recently had the sweet potato soup and the lentil w/roasted peppers. I can't believe I got her to eat lentils!!!! She never liked lentils before and I only got to taste the sweet potato soup as she ate up all the lentil soup!!! Thank You! Pacific foods... she actually asked me if we could go to Whole Foods and buy more, too.
I fell deeply in love with your cream of mushroom last year, but now I've gone vegan and miss it horribly. But I just discovered Almond Milk and am in love all over again! I am trying a couple more of your non-soy milks next.
TGIF! One of my favorite things about the weekend: brunch! What are your favorite brunch meals? Do you go for the sweet or savory? Just found some indulgent (but healthy!) brunch ideas to try.
What are your pantry staples? For me it's broth (Pacific, of course!), rice and stewed tomatoes...all ingredients I always have in my pantry. Any essential ingredients you always have on hand?
I don't know about you, but with the holidays behind us I'm having a hard time getting motivated in the kitchen this week! (We've been eating a lot of yummy Pacific soup!) What's your go-to meal for nights you don't want to cook?

One of my favorite things about winter: pomegranates! While not the easiest to clean (or get out of clothing!) it's great as a snack or as a salad topper. Any other pomegranate lovers out there? What other ways do you eat pomegranate?
Getting excited for the Super Bowl this weekend! It's fun to get together with friends & family. I'm putting together my shopping list for game-day eats...what are your favorite game-day foods?

Patty Jo, The shrimp & okra gumbo was discontinued several years ago. The item was loved by many people in Louisiana, but we were not satisfied with consistent quality of the shrimp and discontinue producing the item. In the fall of this year, Blue Runner will be introducing a gumbo base item that you add your own fresh or frozen shrimp too. It is over the top good! We hope you try it out.
Brenda, We have a Creole Cream Style Black Bean, but not a black eye pea item. The black eye's don't cream up very well.
Near the rice mixes...Blue Runners and rice are soul mates !!!
Canned goods Vegtables or soups
As most of the new products go with rice, it would seem best to place them near rice products than with soup products.
With rice
My mother in law is bringing me a few cans of Blue Runner red beans on tuesday all the way from Alabama! :) I'm a happy woman!
I love Blue Runner red Beans!!!
Can anyone tell me how to make the spicy red bean dip please? Serve hot? Cold? With cheese in it? Thanks
What happened to the Shrimp and Okra Gumbo? I have not found it in the stores for a few years now and would like it again.
Spicy Red Bean Dip Ingredients: 1 clove garlic 2 jalapeno 1 can (15 oz. size)blue runner red kidney beans 1/2 lime, juice of 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 2 chipotle peppers 1or 2 teaspoon adobo sauce (depends on how hot u want it) 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons water Mince garlic in a food processor, add jalapeno and process till fine. Add remaining ingredients and process till smooth.
I've enjoyed your product since I was a kid. Have yall ever thought of making black eye peas? I always look to see if you all have added this to your product line. I can usually only find the red beans and navy beans, though so I haven't tried your other products.
I love red bean gumbo, and always use blue runner beans in it.
Please get your Red Beans in grocery stores in Atlanta. My family is over the shipping fees for a case of Blue Runner Red Beans and my luggage is always over 50 pounds when I leave MSY thanks to your deliciousness!! Your products help me feels like I am back home Help me oh and Geaux Saints!!
Gay Duhon is a wonderful good. She can cook an awesome seafood or chicken and andouille gumbo. She is a great cook all around.
i miss my red beans. 
Only a couple minutes left everyone! William Guidry is the best gumbo chef!!
Well as guilty as charged but i seen other people doing it for the other contestants. So i said what the heck Ill give it a try. Not spamming just having fun voting for a great person that deserves a win. 
2011 will the the 100 anniversary of the Duluth Farmer's Market! Stay tuned for exciting events throughout the year. Tentative opening date: April 30th.
Had a great membership meeting tonight. The 100 year anniversary plans are underway and will be spectacular. Opening date for sure will be April 30th. No official Earth Day celebration as it is Easter weekend. However, everyday is earthday at the Duluth Farmer's Market. Our theme this year: Buy local an keep the economy moving.
I just wanted to say Arnold Pierce was so nice to me after what happen on 1/14/11. He called me back asap and wants to fix the problem. There should be more people like him at Sonic. Thanks so much Arnold. -Sherri Sells
 Sonic, iS that really 100 percent beef inside your patty, or part Milkeshake Cups 
hey in new york theres no sonic near fort drum whats up with that
Sonic Burger w/bacon, chili, cheese, and jalapeos accompanied by chili cheese fries and a Red Velvet & Cheesecake Sonic Blast... Oh and a Cherry Limeade! WHEW LAWD!! It's gonna be a Prilosec kinda night!! But it hurts sooooo good! <3 SONIC!!
i was coming to see you guys tonight. i was craving a #1 with mustard and ketchup, no tomoto, large tots, and medium cherry vanilla dr.pepper. and a chocolate shake for kickers. my wife made me come home and eat rice, chicken and spinach salad. happy MLK DAY. she ruined my dream im filing for divorce a tomorrow. 
Went to Sonic in Paris, KY today. There was a 0.30 charge per beverage added to the reciept. Chocolate for the chocolate milkshake, orange for the orange cream slush, cherry for the cherry slush, and strawberry for the fresh fruit slush apparently costs extra now...When we called, they told us the sign was old and that was to make the price equal to what it should be....never gonna be back there again what a lame excuse! Didn't know that chocolate milkshakes didn't come with chocolate, that they were extra. Not that $1.20 is a big deal, it's the principle of the matter.
Not sure if anyone else has experienced this, but the Sonics around where i live, have stopped serving chicken meals AND cheddar poppers. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
I live in San Diego, and noticed that Sonic is a sponsor of the San Diego State Aztecs basketball team. Why is Sonic a main sponsor for them when there isn't even a Sonic in San Diego, but rather only 1 in the town of Santee 20 miles away? why hasn't there been more drive-ins opened in San Diego?
sonic has really good tots, hot dogs, burgers, shakes, blah blah blah everything from sonic is good! :D
Just had a banana hot fudge sundae with nuts, whipped cream, and a cherry at Sonic. (I know I shouldn't have, but it was mmmmmm-good! Love Sonic!! 
iz not just good, iz sonic good..!
What is going on with your Ft. Lauderdale, FL Beach Location?
Found a Sonic that serves Pickle'O's. they were great. What a blast from the past!!
I want a Red Velvet Cheesecake Blast!!
Where did the sweet potato tots go?????
We should start a campaign to bring back the drink animals. I liked the monkeys.had a whole string hanging off the mirror. My kids have no idea what they are
Any truth to a location opening up inor around Hartsdale, NY*
We have a Sonic in PA on I-81. I had a HUGE craving for chicken tenders the other day.....only to learn that they had NO chicken tenders! WHAT?!? I NEVER had that problem at ANY Sonic in TN or VA!! I was told that they forgot to order them. Tsk Tsk Tsk
Yep just finalized my grooms cake for my wedding ..its going to be a root 44 cherry Dr. pepper with cherry at the top and around the cake ... so pumped to see it 
My first introduction to this great place to eat was in Raleigh, NC
My husband is from Texas and is stationed in Miami with the Army. He misses Sonic the most of anything from home. He makes us drive by the unopened Fort Lauderdale site often just hoping you will open. We have driven an hour to Boynton Beach just for grape slushie and grilled cheese and cheese fries..his favorites. Please..just open Fort Lauderdale already and put him out of his misery. He will be your best customer there. Grape slushie and vodka, please.
I get a 99 cent large diet dr pepper with vanilla almost every morning. And sometimes I get another one at happy hour. Its my addiction! And I LOVE getting the coupons for a free route 44 drink!
I cannot believe that I drive out of my way to actually eat at sonic in Lockport, IL and they do NOT have cheddar bites!! I was so mad! that is all I wanted besides my route 44 diet cherry coke. :( :( :(
ughh so good but so fating. i wonder why people have probloms with diabeties,chelstrol,and overweight. becuase we are the number1 country for fastfood.UNITEDSTATES.Were all going die with some kind of disease.
 Well if your complaining about it making people fat~ then don't eat it!!! Its as simple as that!!! I love Sonic! 
love, love, love the pepper poppers and cherry limemaid =)
Do sonic workers still have to rollarskate in -10 weather? Just wondern?
i love sonic so much! i miss it so bad since i havent been to one in over 3 years because i live in indiana where you cant find any sonic drive-ins. but just so you know, sonic has an awesome employee! her name is dakota and works and one in cookeville TN
I would love for sonic to actually make the red velvet blast really taste like one..... I was very disappointed when got mine about 5 minutes ago. And it wasn't the deep red like you see on t.v. It was light pink. Sad!
there is nothing like a sonic burger!!
I love Sonic Drinks,but after what happened yesterday I have to speak up. Tell the kids that are running the board, to let the customer ORDER. DO NOT INTERUPT THEM! LISTEN! Now lets try that again! I need a large Cherry Dr Pepper with no ice............

Sonic arriving in Billings Montana this Spring! Woo Hoo!

Cherry Lime-Aid !!
Wondering why Sonic doesn't offer Caffiene Free Coke & Diet Coke. I am pregnant and I am not supposed to have caffiene. I know there are others out there with medical problems that can't have it either. I sure miss my Happy Hour. I am not a sprite or root beer person either. 
Dear Sonic of FC, Work on mixing your red velvet cheesecake blasts better.. it looks like there is blood all in the bottom of my cup where they were very obviously poorly made. and it's kind of revolting. KKKKK THANKS. 
Where is my Steak sandwich???? Steak & cheese mmmm mmmmmm!
Sonic be prepared in memphis appling is gonna terrorize sonic at 9:00
we seriously need one in san bernardino/riverside area. twenty minutes is to long to drive when you need a burger!
That red velvet cheesecake blast is sooo good!
Have you had your rt.44 peach sweet tea today? 
yummmmmmm chili cheese tots! 
Sonic in the western branch area Chesapeake VA. Service sucks. They're are the worst sonic I've ever been too.
Sonic here in billings, mt is about done should be home with in a month yes looking forward to the musturd burgers and big 40 cherry limeade
sonic #4132 in Glendale Arizona is the best sonic ever! Dr pepper games here we come!!!!
Sonic, is it true? I've heard Pickle-o's are coming back?!!! I LOVE PICKLE-O'S and have not seen them in a long long time!!!!
Dear Sonic, I have worked here for five years. I used to make really good tips when I first started. Our store was retrofitted and we had a drive thru. My tips went way down as well as our customer service. Now, everyone pays with a credit card and we do not make tips off of credit cards which really sucks! It makes carhopping and dealing with rude customers all day not even worth it. Some one needs to realize that they need to come up with the technology to make that possible. People want to quit because the money is not good. This is a common complain throughout most sonics in my area.
Does watching those lime green football fields all day make you crave a limeade, too?
Who's up for some breakfast on wheels?
We're happy to report that our Franklin, TN location is once again open for business!
Sonic Fuel in Rockwell, NC Jeffrey Stanton Racing and Jeffreys Toy Closet thinking about adding some great food fuel for Rockwell Harvest Days. Jeffrey is the racer of the 44-61 INEX Legend and also founder of Jeffreys Toy Closet which helps children in the Rockwell and surrounding areas. On this day Jeffrey had one thing on his mind, Sonic Popcorn Chicken!
Jeffrey Stanton Racing and the Sonic Fries Man...Jeffrey was supporting Napa of Rockwell, Pig Pen's Original Seasoning,Family Dollar,Sonic and other businesses in the Rockwell area during Rockwell's Harvest Days. Jeffreys Toy Closet was on hand also collecting toys for the 2010 Christmas Toy Drive. Last week all the toys collected were distributed to children in the Rockwell and surrounding towns and communities bringing great joy to the kids that received them.
What team are you rooting for this weekend?
If you live in Phillipsburg, NJ, today is your lucky day! We opened a brand new location at 1192 US Highway 22 just this morning.
The news is reporting that there's snow in 49 states today. That calls for some chili, don't you think? Footlong Quarter Pound Coney, Chili Cheese Tots, Chili Cheese Fries...
Red Velvet Cheesecake Blast. That is all.
Good food. Bowl games. 2011 is off to a great start!
ice cream problems lol
Who says wintertime isn't ice cream season? That's what hot fudge is for!
Seeing a lot of comments about our coffee today. Is Sonic your coffee shop?
Our sonic in Plain Twp. Ohio at Washington Square is almost finished!! yay! (I hear there are customers there today, but I'm betting it's training!)
coffee comments? how about "employee parking in the handicapped space" comments? I HAVE A FEW...
Please open in New Hampshire!!!
I am begging for a diet slush!!!! Please make a diet strawberry, or pia colda, or any other flavor just make it diet!!! FYI Truvia is the BEST no-cal sweetener there is!!!
There aint nothing like a supersonic cheese burger with mustard, large chili fries, and a route 44 cherry vanilla coke. That's he stuff :D
Did sonic open at beach place in ft lauderdale?
Sent the wife off to the local Sonic yesterday. I wanted two super breakfast burritos and some tatter tots. When she gets home i learn that they are out of tater tots. I ask her how did they make the burrito. She tells me that she doesn't know. And oh they were also out of sausage. I do enjoy Sonic once in a while but sorry we are out of half our product does not cut it. Especialy when they cobble some other ingredients together.
Saw the Red Velvet shakes on the menu...yea too bad they were OUT of it here^
Really want to try a red velvet cheesecake blast but my sonic ran out of the cheesecake bits yesterday & im not very happy about it :( why do they have to keep running the commercial?
Someone from Sonic's marketing department should become friends with the various Chick-fil-A locations here in Southern California on Twitter & FB to see how to really use social networking posts to push promotions and drive traffic to your individual restaurants. CF uses secret words / phrases and give away things like sandwiches and other items. Not some gimmick, ten cents off coupon either but stuff of real substance. It would be far more useful to your customers / friends then just pinging them with random blurbs or thoughts and will get people to pay attention. It's a common internet marketing mistake to think that just yelling something randomly everyday out to your social network friends is doing anything other than just overloading our walls and e mail boxes. We want something of value....
Kinda mad. U advertise the new Red Velvet Cheesecake blast and finally have to have one and had to go to 3 different Sonics because the first 2 were out. With the price of gas that is 1 more blast that I couldve had. Good bt nt worth going all over town for.
hey guys...i work at a sonic and i served probly over 20 cheesecake blasts yesterday and they do go quick but were always stocked up on it...also if u do get to order one be sure to tell them to go easy on the red velvet syrup, otherwise itll b too sweet and tangy and u dont want that
also i wanna know y sonic is so expensive know? I used to b able to order a cheeseburger with fries and a drink for $5 now its costs me about $11 for all that stuff....my employee discounts r about the same price as it used to b for regular customers...prices need to go down cuz customers in my town r complaining that we r too expensive nowadays
just lettin everyone know u can order any drink on the menu and have it slushed if u didnt know...its delicious...dr. Pepper slush ftw
I WANT YOUR CHEESE STICKS AND A DR. PEPPER SLUSH. Hook me up? ;D

Any plans on opening a store in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan?? I go into withdrawl when I go there to visit and cannot get me an icy cold Sonic Coca Cola. thanks
The Red Velvet Cheesecake blast is INCREDIBLE!!!! Thankyou for starting my year off perfectly!!!
I could really have used an Apple Juice Slush today! 
Has anyone tried the Red Velvet Icecream treat this month with the cheesecake? I did and am not impressed. Wish they would have brought back the peppermint (Andes) treat they had last year during the Holidays. 
 If you live in Phillipsburg, NJ, today is your lucky day! Sonic opened a brand new location at 1192 US Highway 22 monday.. SWEET... 
 I enjoy Sonic alot .Just an Idea how about a Sonic Slider simular to the White Castle Slider . You can give them a run for the money and producer a better Slider with 100% beef . Sonic Sliders are Sonic Good!!!!!! 
We enjoy our "new" Sonic Drive-in located on Route 9 north, Waretown, NJ. Super-duper staff and fantastic food at VERY reasonable prices. Feed alot for a little! <3
Dr. Pepper Sonic Games 2011 have begun. Who's in??

myself and countless others anxiously awaiting the opening of the Billings MT location!!! please hurry!!! lol
The Red Velvet Cheesecake Blast looks fabulous!
I'm a carhop and I was wondering if there is a website where I can buy winter gear like hoodies instead of having to order from the catalog. Thanks!
I have a PERFECT LOCATION for you guys to move into if you all are interested. I live in Cross Lanes, WV and there is a nearby sonic in St.Albans, WV, but here in Cross Lanes we aren't feelin' the love lol...anyways. It was originally an Hardees, then A&W, then a family pharm, but nothing but an empty building now. The set up of the building & the lot is perfect for the specs of a sonic. Check it out here on Google Maps!
SAY MAN YALL NEED TO BRING THE POPCORN CHICKEN BACK THAT WAS ON POINT...I WAS ALL CONFUSED WHEN I WENT THERE AND YALL DIDNT HAVE IT NO MORE!!!!!!!!!
will SONIC's be setting in Bremerton or Silverdale. Washington Anytime SOON?? practicly this entire town talks about sonics and would LOVE LOVE LOVE to have one in our area!!
Nothing like sonic burger..mmmmmm
I am so excited for the new Sonic model opening in Fort Lauderdale. Any word on when it might open?
When will the Fort Lauderdale, FL location open?
Sprawdzamy jakosc burgerow w Sonic , laski dostaja ocene 5/5
Ordered a reg. blast at 3:37 and delivered to me at 3:51. 14 min for a sonic blast! Why is it always like this at the West Monroe, La. sonic? This is why I rarely go bc ordering actual food is even longer than 14 min. 
The red velvet cheesecake is AWESOME!!!
Got me an Apple juice slush today!... I had to make it myself but I got it. I just ordered a flavorless shush and added my own juice! YUMMY! 
Drinking a strawberry slush right now and its great :)
What happened to the hot fudge cake sundae? :(
Love your new red velvet cheesecake blasts!!!
What happen to the cheesecake Bites??? :(
Im a carhop at sonics, New idea..can you guys do FRIED ICECREAM blast for a limited time offer?? Please :) Just a idea for the company!
I was wondering why we have not had a mint sonic blast.
What ab0ut this idea!!! What ab0ut at Hall0ween and Thanksgiving y0u have a Pumpkin Blast!!! Hey, it c0uld be c00l! MMM! :-)
I ALSO LOVE SONIC,I LIKE THEIR PINEAPPLES AND BANANA MILKSHAKES
I EAT BREKFAST AND DINNER AT SONIC EVRY DAY ALMOST BECASE I WORK AS A COOK AND DONT HAVE TEH TIME TO MAKE MY OWN FOOD WHEN I GET HOME. YUO ARE TEH REESON I AM SO FAT
In Hattiesburg,MS we have 4 sonics. Ive been working at sonic on and off for 14 years. Been back for almost 4 years this time. I wish we could get the fried pickles back here.....
Dear Sonic, I like how you substituted onion rings for free, I don't however like that the chicken strip meal is $4.99. Or that my onion rings are burnt. :(
Looking for ideas on a pineapple drink combo from sonic...any suggestions?
Need more locations in california I drive 45 minutes n u need semitruck parking
So, the current Sonic commercials fail in comparisson to the ones with the people in the cars, like the "YOU'RE A CHEAP DATE" one... Just saying.
Does Sonic still have the breakfast drink made with oj & cherry syrup? 4got the name of it but it had Sunrise in it. Had it in Texas, but don't see it on menu in IL. 
A SONIC is just down the road from the house. Yummy!
I wanted to say that the sonic drive-in in wenatchee washington is amazing and a carhop named teresa is there best employee. :) She always provides great service with a smile. Puts a smile on my face. :)
When did the Sonic in Monroe Michigan open? I just drove by today and saw it was open! Yipeeee!

We are very disappointed in the USDAs decision to deregulate GE Alfalfa with no conditions (meaning no restrictions to support coexistence).

amazing! We have been blessed to be a recipient of delicious meals provided by our friends ( some amazing cooks , too!) as Dave recovers from heart surgery..sure was a load off my plate ( no pun intended, lol) to not have to worry, about preparing good healthy meals, while being in the hospital, and being home following the hospital, Dave and I were there at the same time, for a bit! Our friends are awesome! 
I love this site! It is always a labor of love to provide help to friends and family in need - you have taken all the LABOR out of it! I also like posting the meals you will be bringing. When I had our second child we had lasagna delivered three nights in a row. While we were appreciative of the meals, we still laugh about that one with our friends!
appreciates the support!
Thanks to Vegetarian Times for profiling mealTrain.com in the January issue.
Thanks to Meredith Eaton of the Good Life Gourmet for recommending mealTrain.com. If you are looking for a meal idea, check out her recipes for Italian Easter Pie and Pasta e Fagioli Soup.
A great story of how meal train helped Suzanne with her recovery. Do you have a story to share? Please send it to contact@mealtrain.com and we may profile you.
Brilliant idea, thank you so much!
What a fabulous website/software ... this is soooo easy to use and such a great idea! I just wonder if there could be an additional adaptation of the meal train software, to support communities wanting to help friends with transportation to treatments, Dr's appts, etc. ... (hint, hint, to the founders :))
Love this! I second the idea that additional functionality would be great to expand this beyond meals to laundry, transportation, house cleaning, etc., for groups trying to support people who are ill or going through a difficult time. 
I was so happy to find there was such a support system like "Meal Train". We have a friend who is very ill and this is so easy and will help out immensley. Thank you for creating it!!
I teach childbirth classes and this will be a welcome addition to my postpartum class--makes the traditional food tree so much easier to organize make useful for the family. Yeah!
Burlington, you deserve a shout out for being so amazingly practical, efficient & tech-savy. Way to go to the B-ton residents who designed this site + service! Thank you, thank you. 
My long time friend Rita Kay in Sacramento learned of this when her daughter Laura recently had her first baby, DeClan. Rita Kay set the whole thing up for me while I was still in the hospital. This is perfect. My husband, Marty, doesn't cook, so this handles many stressors for us at this time. Wonderful support system!!
Wonderful idea! Michael, I just recommended the site to 88 friends on my page. Best wishes to you!
La Leche League of Rock County, WI uses your site to organize bringing meals to new moms.
Wonderful, beautiful idea! Everyone needs to check out this great great support service!
What an amazing support group!
For anyone who has helped to organize multiple people bringing meals to a family in need, this is a wonderful new service that will make the task so much easier!
I love your web site! I made 2 meal train sites for some friends of ours- one for food delivery and the other for snow and grass removal! Thanks mealtrain.com for making it so easy! 
Wish I had found this for Mallory and her caregivers. I am so grateful for the support through this transition time. Thanks-

Huge box of varied fruits and veggies arrived today from Organics Delivered- and was even cheaper than the non-organic grocery store alternative.
One of the ways I brew coffee in the morning
Organics Delivered brought swiss chard, squash, kiwis, red onion, oranges, avocado and more. Looks like we'll be having a nice salad, inshallah.

Eating Halal While Traveling:
Be safe in the kitchen by squaring off the round edges of fruits and vegetables like potatoes. It gives a firmer hold and prevents slipping when cutting with sharp knives.
Ever wonder what to do with those mesh bags you get with onions? Secure around a sponge and use to scour surfaces (not to be used on non-stick or other sensitive pans or surfaces).
Clean out your fridge regularly to save money and time when preparing your next meals. I'm doing just that now, while waiting for the arrival of produce from Organics Delivered. Can't wait to see what comes!
Do you know Top Chef Just Desserts contestant Malika Ameen? Read my interview with her here and get to know this very talented Chicago Pastry Chef: 
Sweet Tomato Preserve: It's sort of like a chutney (but not spicy). Great on toast!

Bismillah. Coffee is brewing and I'm ready to start the day- well, after I drink it.
So what does your healthy breakfast look like? Eggs? Oatmeal? Cereal?
A firm enough {small} avocado will fit perfectly in an egg slicer- and makes for easy, clean cutting! #kitchentip

Good morning! Am loving the new worst cooks series. Are your "teaching" recipes posted somewhere? Thank you.
The work that you do outside your Chef work is so wonderful. Cassandra's story is awesome and glad that my favorite chef has a special heart of gold. Worst Cooks is great. I thought I was a bad cook, but these guys put me to shame. I would hate to be the one having to be the recipient of some of these cooks at home, wow!!!! I tried making a beef stew last night for the first time in my crockpot. Didn't come out well, meat tough and potatoes weren't all the way cooked. Guess I could use some help too.... giggle.
see you at Wine fest this year?!?! ;) looking forward to it! maybe I can help ya cook! lol ~Nicole
Just let me know what the deal is with the auction item i bid on. If you are at the gym later this week just swing in if u got time. What time is your Wed Eat party? Good job w/ the event and all you do. See ya.
To those of you who own, or are willing to buy, or can possibly borrow, a copy of "Impossible to Easy," you must try the asiago-stuffed chicken cacciatore. I made it for our Sunday dinner yesterday, and it was so fabulous, there are no words to describe it! And the Cornish pasties from the same book are haunting me: I can't stop thinking about how scrumptious they are! The last time I made them, the family just gathered around the stove to eat them directly from the cookie sheet, because stopping to set out a plate and utensils might delay the next bite for 30 seconds. Chef has really done an awesome job of sharing his genius with us through his two books. Both "Impossible to Easy" and "Mission: Cook" are such masterpieces of culinary invention and instruction, no other cookbooks can compare. 
Remembering the ice hotel episode of D:I today--temp when I got up today was -8 F. Brrrr! And Casa Larga is gearing up for the ice wine festival!
Yo Chef Robert, I'm wanting to make a "shepherd's pie".... got any pointers for me?
In your busy schedule this year are you going to any food and wine festivals, like disney, atlantic city, south beach
Hello robert i hear you goin to be at the wine fest this year i would like to know when and where this is happening
Dear Chef Robert, can you please send me a message to discuss the possibility of you catering my wedding? It wont be for a while but my biggest wish is for you to cater it. I know it will cost a lot but I want to at least discuss it with you before ruling out the possibility. Please help me make my dream wedding happen!!!!!
I posted this on my facebook page, feel free to copy and add to your page. Get the word out for our favorite chef. YAHOO. you a chef robert irvine fan, well you should be, I am and there is a new show on January 19 on the foodnetwork called Resturant Impossible, if you ever saw Dinner Impossible you will love this, and why not try worst cooks, with Chef Irvine and Chef Burrell. 
I just want to thank you and Chef Anne for "Worst Cooks in America". I watch it faithfully with my 14 yr old daughter and 13 yr old son. It has inspired them to get in the kitchen with me and to learn how to cook. I LOVE IT!! We can not wait for Restaurant: Impossible tomorrow night. God Bless!!
Well Chef it is another snowy day in NH. Not sure who is doing the hapy "Let it snow" dance, but they must stop, hahaha =). Going to try my hand at home made tomato soup. Any pit falls I should know about? LOL Have a great day, stay warm and dry!
Good luck with the reveal today!! Very exciting!!
Hi chef. can't wait to meet you in person at mohegan sun for the winefest. Me and my wife missed you when you came to Rhode island but we won't miss you this time.
I posted this as my status last night, but I thought you would appreciate knowing you also have some very young fans, too.: "Not sure how to take it when I overhear the girls playing "Worst Cook in America" while they are sitting at the dinner table with the meal I just cooked. Lena did say my chicken was "spot on" though." 
So Glad the Demo, build and reveal went well......I sooo would have loved to see the family's face when they saw their new house for the first time! :D What a great moment to be part of! :D Thank You for sharing with us Chef :D
Hey Chef, hope today found you happy and healthy.. Please if you could tomorrow, please take a moment out of your day to honor a member of my local Police department in Lakewood who will be laid to rest tomorrow after lossing his life on the job at the handle of a heartless teenage gang banger.. I am sure his family,friend's,co-workers and fellow residents would appreciate the gesture 
Got a real good pic of you and Chris at the end of the show. Not sure who has the bigger guns. Maybe I will have to see that pose again but w/out the cover up:) Yeah I know. Just dreaming. Catch you later.
Last year when I first treated my daughter and her 2 sons to EAT, we had a BLAST!!! Everything was good and the boys were looking around what people are getting for dessert and Jeremy was 11 years old then, saw a huge chocolate cake that some one ordered. He immediately said " that is my desert!!" and so he got it. His eyes were rolling for joy and said " I CAN NOT BELIEVE I AM EATING HAPPINESS!!!" We all laughed and passed the cake among us. IT WAS HEAVENLY!!! The best of luck to all you do. I am trying to keep up with your new shows and I am bringing 2 friends for dinner very soon.
Restaurant: Impossible! What more can I say!?! I get the shivers just thinking of positive changes we all get to finally see! Wowsa!!
Good evening Chef, hope you are having a great day. I just wanted to thank you for the thoughtful statement you posted today in regards to Officer Chris Matlosz, both the community of Lakewood,his friends and family, as well as all of us in New Jersey thank you for your kindness. Cant wait for Resturant Impossible tonight
My evening is going well. I just can't wait for 10 o'clock to get here so I can watch Restaurant: Impossible. Congratulations on the new show :)
my and my daughter evening is going well. I just can't wait for 10 o'clock to get here so I can watch Restaurant: Impossible. Congratulations on the new show
I just want to say that my 3 year old son Robby loves dinner impossible.. he will pick you Chef Robert over Dora any day lol :)
Five minutes to go!! Restaurant Impossible!!
Hey Chef! We had pork and beef roast with a lovely gravy along with German potato dumplings filled with homemade croutons......red cabbage dotted with juniper berries! It was a comfort food night! Have a wonderful evening and hope to see you soon on H.H.I.!
oooh Chef! you tearing the decoraters up! i love it! btw you looked great with that axe in your hands, swinging away lol. 
i bet you wont use those same decoraters again. you did an awesome job pulling everything together. congrats on a great show. cant wait for the next one! be blessed!
that was a tear jerker, sad that paul jr died. glad to hear the resturant is still open and doing well. What ever happened to the chairs, were the replaced. Glad Paul got to see that before he passed. You did an amazing job, this show is a hit
Holy Crap is all I can say and Chef Robert remind me NEVER TO PISS U OFF!!!! There were a few times my Husband and I looked at the TV and we were even cringing....Like during the beginning and the owner/manager was fighting you as it went to commercial my Husband said "ya, go ahead and fight Robert and Robert will break you!!!" Great Job None the Less :D
Love the concept and thought RI is off to a very good start. Just a few thoughts: lose the 2 decorators and get ones who are on the same page with you on not necessarily the vision but the timeline. They didn't seem to understand the urgency. $10,000 seems like a ridiculously low budget, almost unrealistic seeing how much things cost these days. Loved your attitude thoughout the whole show. You made it clear from the get-go that you were there to do a job for the restaurant owners and that ego had no place getting in the way. One last thing, I'd lose the axe. It seemed just a wee bit melodramatic or an imitation of other home improvement shows. You don't need to go down that route, the concept, cast and production are a cut way above that. Job well done, Chef. Best, Paul & Lisa
You promised a great show that WASNT Kitchen Nightmares, and you delivered. Food Network needs to sign the next season now. I was watching the twitter stream and all positive comments, I think it's a hit.
RI was a great show! I know several places I wish had that kind of intervention before they went under already. I agree with some others comments, DROP those designers, find a couple you know are 100% on board and take them on the road if you have to! You were 100% right on those chairs. It was horrible, even if the paint wasn't such a mess, they were ugly. I didn't love the solid white walls, the big red stripe, it just didn't send out the feeling of a family style place. If only the entire place looked like that room you were in tasting the 4 new chef's food. But budget was tight we know. Dinner: Impossible is still my all time favorite FN show but this was a good job. Look forward to seeing more. 
Wonderful!!!!!! really enjoyed it and cant wait for next week. i think u did an amazing job esp with a hc that backs out designers with horrible attitudes and the chairs just needed a good refinish in a dark colour but hey u knew they didnt look good!!!! im glad god has given u the fight to help others!!!!! continue please!!
Restaurant impossible was very good just like i knew it would be! made everyone in the house watch it. Can't wait for next week!! :)
Awww...people gotta cut the decorators a little slack. They did an awesome job...the chairs just didn't work out. At all. Big part of that? Whoever went and bouggt the paint bough oil base...they wouldn't dry! Ever! Haha and I can say that since I was one of 5 people who pulled all the tape off the chairs...and moved them in...then took them out...then carried in the rental chairs. All in all? It was an amazing transformation for such a short period of time. 
What was with the executive chef who wouldn't take the job? Did he think he was competing on "Chopped"? You told them beforehand to leave if they weren't ready for a long-term commitment at Villari's. As if transforming the restaurant weren't hard enough, you had to deal with broken promises from that guy, the designers, and even the rental company. I'm surprised you were willing to film a second episode after all the headaches in this one. I loved your take-charge attitude, though--and the axe! 
Chef just finished watching your new restaurant Impossible I have been in the construction business for years and those designers you had just about sunk you they should have been fired as soon as you told them you didnt like the chairs . I hope you have better luck but the show was great and very moving. I have always loved the fact that you can make it happen Rick Trites
HUGS & LOVE to you ! :-) Everthing is just awesome on the Network now that you have some new series on the food tube !
I love, Love, LOVE seeing all the pics of you and Worst Chefs out at the FN website! You all so deserve it!!! Go Team Irvine!!!
I sent you good wishes during your dark time and you e-mailed me back, " It's not what it seems." And then added, "I have faith." The new shows are wonderful. Your faith, talent and impressive 'guns' survived the storm and we are all better for it. Bravo, dear Chef. Bravo.
I got to hand it to you Chef - patience, determination, and pride in your cooking, and teaching of your students on Worst Cooks in America. Yes you are Saint Robert!
Hi Chef I just watched RI it was awesome. I use to live in Philly so I use to go to Villari's alot back in the 80's. I had stopped going because their quality was fading and the attitude towards customers were failing. But I have to say the next time I go back to Philly for a visit, I will go to Villari's!! I love what you did with the place and the food looks awesome!!!! Thanks for bringing back an institution!
Almost 11:00 at night and I have the sudden urge to bake chocolate cupcakes!!!! Well my kids will LOVE MOMMY in the morning!!! :D Nighty All
Hi Chef! Mohegan Sun Winefest is just a week away! Are you ready to party?!! We are!!
Hello Robert just want to say Good Night 
Great job on the show Chef. It was a joy to watch and so glad you 86'd the "painted" chairs. I can't imagine the designers preferred those over the rented ones? I know it was a tight budget, but come on........find a way that doesn't look so TACKY! Question on the Chef that backed out of the job? Wasn't he an owner/chef from a Kitchen Nightmares episode? He was a jerk then and again on RI. I'm glad he backed out. The restaurant is MUCH BEtter off without him. BE Well Chef!!!

Chef Robert.....i would like to personally say thank you. A couple weeks back my husband posted a comment on your page about how his friend that came home from across seas went to you place and you eat with them and paid for their meal etc. then my husband lead to tell you that his health isn't the greatest and so on. I know you see a lot of post and don't remember it. but when you replied to his post you made him a happy man. you made him feel so good. I have got to somehow get him your your resturant. I would like to do it when i know you will be there. We are huge fan and everytime my husband watch your shows it just brings a smile to his face. he is always talking about you and how much of a great person and good hearted person you are. well i see that. I just wanted to say keep up the great work. and thank you. 
Loved RI, Chef Robert! Actually, I love watching ALL your shows. The reveal to the family was very emotional...I had tears too! You did a wonderful job for them! P.S. I agree, the chairs the designers painted were horrible! As an interior design graduate myself, I don't know what they were thinking! Keep up the FABULOUS work! :)
Come to our VIM Soup Challenge at Shelter Cove Mall on Sunday!
Hello Chef Robert! I'm a private chef for a big family. I cook by your recipes a lot! My fam' enjoy their steaks with quite succulent sauces. They love your sun-dried tomato demi glace. Is there a similar glace or sauce that you would recommend? Thank you! Liga
Hope you landed safely Chef...And could ya please mail some sun my way PWEEAASSEE!!!!! And WARMTH....I feel like nanook of the north here...Brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Does anyone know where I can find pictures from the dinner possible event last friday? I've been told to look at extreme makeovers site but it doesnt have but a few pictures. I'm trying to find one of me and my wife on our 1st date in 4 years since our 1st child was born. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
Hello Chef Robert! My wife and I are your die hard fans which we watched DI, RI, and Worst Cooks (only Season 2 cuz you are in!). My wife got me hooked on Dinner Impossible last year was when I was impressed of your professional talent and your sense of humor! I noticed you wore hearing aid - we both are deaf. If you come up to Portland, Oregon area for your cooking event or something, we would be honored to meet you in person! Thumb up to your hard work!
Hi Chef... Just wanted to wish you a great weekend! :)
Alert! Anyone in my area.....Worst Cooks is on now (2pm)
My daughter is in SD, a graphic designer. She had worked for some restaurant when she was in Atla. Just moved to SD in 9/09. If you need some help, I can get in touch with her. She is a free lance and has her own bussiness at home. Just let me know. Thinking and praying for your success in all that you do.
When you have a chance after your work out, can you think of one of your favorite restaurant in Manhattan NY? My son is there since the 80's and his birthday is on this month. I would like to buy him a gift certificate to a good restaurant that you can recommend. My children and myself and my late husband love to go to good restaurant and I need your recommendation. I will try to go to Atla to visit my 2 children there and go to Atlantic Seafood to try your best dessert there that I saw you eating.....Passion fruit trifle? Am I right?
I'm making your chicken cacciatore recipe i found on food network's website tonight! i had the hardest time finding shallots here in west virginia, but i finally did! hope you are having a great weekend as well!
Hey Chef, I just wanted to say that your recipe for Southwestern Bbq Chicken Breast on your web site was very delicious. I just got done with making it and couldn't wait to try it. Hats off to you for this dish. Thank you. :)
Hey Chef Robert, Congratulations on your latest debute of Restaurant Impossible. I loved it. You did GREAT when dealing with everyone. You always brought a positive into any negative...Very touching and the absolute proof of a true professional. Not too harsh but not too soft. NICE. Keep it up. BTW,,, what about your OWN restaurant ??? Any time soon ? 
HEy Chef - we just watched "Restaurant Impossible" and loved it! You do some amazing things for people who are in need! Enjoy your weekend! Hugs from Colorado!
Chef Robert...I love your shows, from Worst cook, Dinner Impossible and Restaurant Impossible....Do you have a good recipe for Broccoli and Cheese soup? I had one but can't find it now. Thanks
I hope you are enjoying our California sunshine! 
Just want to say good night robert hope your day was great and good night to everyone else
Bears v Packers game today, GO BEARS and the next best thing Worst Cooks
I read all of your status updates with my best British accent in my head. :D
Chef Robert! I'm going to be undergoing my own mini "Dinner Impossible". Our small church is putting on a Valentine's Day Bash for our community, free of charge. Our way of telling our community we love them. So...our Pastor has asked that I (and a crew of helpers), prepare for 2 seatings of 100 each, salad, chicken parm, bread and dessert. The kicker? In our church kitchen with 2 residential ovens, about 4 electric skillets, 3 18qt roasters and not much else, and...for a budget of about $350!!!! Lord help me! =)
Hello Chef! I hope you're enjoying your Sunday! I am looking forward to my buy of Black & Gold to bring down the Steel Curtain on those Jets!! :) I have a question, if I may? I make a lovely tasting (in my opinion!) lemon curd. However, I always have lumps, which I'm pretty certain is cooked pieces of egg white. But I don't know why this happens. Is it that my heat is too high on my double boiler, or I'm not stirring enough, or I use a silicon whisk rather than metal, a combination of all 3, or....?? Any hints would be wonderful. Thank you, Maestro. :)
Hi Chef, just a reminder my husband and I would still like to attend the wine fest, we'd like to come to the Bubble and Bon Bons on Sunday evening...can you still arrange that ?
Hi Chef, My husband and I just learned the WORSE news ever..We were at the California Adventure Park yesterday and inquired about the Food and Wine Festival. And, it is not happening this year at the Park, nor the hotels. So, we will not be seeing you this year. How depressing! We were just devastated.....will you be coming the the Los Angeles area anytime soon? If so, please keep us informed. Thank you so much!! 
Watching the re-run of Restaurant Impossible! And remembering the day I was migraining and you called me to help me through it! ...and you told me about RI! Wow! Bringing back memories! So glad it's nothing like Gordon Ramsey's thing!! :))
Hey chef. I am looking for the shepherd pie recipe you make. it is for my son when he gets out of the hospital. He loves it can you direct me to it. I told you about him. He tried to commit suicide. 
Hey Robert, it is me again. My son is going to Seattle Washington for a meeting, can you recommend a restaurant or 2 PLEASE? i CAN NOT WAITE FOR YOUR WORST COOK TONIGHT!! TAKE CARE. I will let you know who won the VIM Soup Chalenge when I hear from my friend. 
Gah....watching the clock is like watching PAINT PEEL!!!!!!!
Safe journey home. Will be watching Worse Chefs in 27 minutes!
Just started watching Restaurant Impossible - I was skeptical at first, but I actually like it better than Kitchen Nightmares! My husband and I are hooked!
Hey Robert i watch one of your dinner impossible today and the one at the Amusement Park Adventure i thought it was awesome but i missed a part in the show where you had a guy go buy salmon scallops ect like to know how did get away with it and not failing the misson
Four minutes until Worst Chef's!!! Yea!!
Chef, Thank you. He is 14 yrs old. Your shows Rock. My e-mail is hallbenjamin@comcast.net. Watching your "worst cooks" right now. My son would fit in with that show. Last month I fussed at him for attemping to cook eggs with no oil or butter of any kind. Feel bad now for getting on to him for that. He was always cooking scrambled eggs like that. I am DVRing all the show your on so he will be able to watch them. If he is allowed to. Thank you again Chef. 
watching worst cooks right now can't wait to try the duck recipe!!!!
Who is your pick for super bowl champs???? Green Bay or Pittsburgh??? I myself will go for Pittsburgh!!
great show, lots of interesting things going on Go Blue team
Well what am episode....I started crying...and did I see tears in your eyes chef??? Love to try the duck...just not sure...the few times I have had it OUT its been VERY GREASY and not so nice in the mouth.. : /
good show....my husband and i were talking about duck and jeff wants to try duck. i won't attempt it. i am a picky eater. i will cook it but wont eat it. but i enjoyed the show tonight. have a great week :)
Hey Chef, what vegetables did the cooks julienne and how were they seasoned ? Cooked in oil, butter ? Sorry, I was going back and forth from the Jet game to your show, and missed the details. See you next week at Mohegan sun
Go BLUE TEAM!!! The sliders and the duck main dish are super chalenging.
Hello gorgeous Robert! You are painfully good looking! How does it feel to be the hottest chef on the planet? PS I love restaurant impossible! <3<3<3 Nikki
Have another safe flight! Watched the show last night....it was a shocker! Didn't see Anna going home. Was glad to see TY pull together on the main dish challenge and live to learn another day. Finally got to see RI last night as well. And I am on everyone's side about the hidious chairs! I don't know if it is my new england blood, but they screamed seafood dinning to me. Anyway, keep 'em coming! Have a great day!
Chef! Are you ignoring me? ; )
Please Robert if you have time, will you give me 1 or 2 of your favorite restaurant in Seattle Washington where my son from Atla will have a Psychological meeting to attend. My son is the director of Georgia Tech Univ. Center of Counseling. Thanks again. I have a contact at the ALTO rest. that you recommended for my other son in Manhattan and we like it!! Take good care of yourself.
Just popped in to say Good Morning Chef..can't stay because I haven't watched Worst Cooks yet and don't want to know. Have a fantastic day!!:)
Loved worst cooks!! best episode yet! You got rid of both ding-bats at once...Anna should have listened when you said serving rare duck would get someone sent home! Any way, hope you have a great day!! Can't wait for Restaurant: Impossible!!
I always knew those cooking classes at Caesars were just a dress rehearsal for ya! I wish you much continued luck in all of your ventures, I'll be watching!
I loved watching Worst Cooks last night! Good to see the progress some of the "recruits" are making. Lamb and duck breast are not the easiest dishes to pull off by even some more "seasoned" cooks....those that are in the top are really rising to the challenge!
if figure out how to watch worst cook in America youtube 
Wanted to let ya know chef I made your Turkey Breast this evening and it was DAH BOMB!!! Rest of the family liked it too...I switched up the potatoes for my sausage sage stuffing and homemade creamed corn :D
hey chef, are you still scouting out new locations to open a second restaurant ? If so, have to decided on any potential cities/ states ? Just curious.
I just wanted to say that you are like.... The greatest chef that ever lived.... =) I really like Worst Cooks in America. You are awesome, Chef Robert!
Have you consider about winning Mr Olympia? With your muscles over muscles which I bet you weighed about 265 pounds, you would had won Mr Olympia and beat Arnold Schwarzenegger if he completes in Mr Olympia. Picture it - Chef wins Mr Olympia! 
I was just wondering- how would you treat your 13 year old if she made honor roll. Kaycee made the honor roll and im trying to think of something special!!!!
One or 2 restaurants in Seattle Washington that you can recommend please? 'love all your shows. I also want to see you more on Iron Chef. Thanks and take good care.
Chef! I made my first Chateaubriand and it was to die for!
Hey Chef! Just wanted to say thanks for showing us that you care about your fans!! You are awesome and I hope that you kick chef Anne's hiney. 
Hey Cheg! This is an update about my son. I told you about him he tried to commit suicide. The Hospital called and said he should be able to come home tomorrow. He asked about shepherd pie when he got out. I can find one of yours. Can you direct me to where to find one. The good news is that he is coming home. There is no chef better that you. Love your shows, there is not enough of them.
Good evening Chef! I made your Lemon Thyme-Infused Chicken with warm leek, asparagus and red bliss potato salad from your first cookbook tonight. Hubby took seconds!!! :) However, my salad dressing tasted a bit too acidic. I followed the recipe, so any ideas what I might be able to tweak? THANKS!!! xo
Robert....The owner of Rascals Restaurant in Delaware bad mouthed "Restaurant Impossible" and The Food Network in the local paper today....One of the things he said that the show sprinkled caraway seeds on the floor to make it look like rat droppings for the filming...He said a few other things as well....To tell the truth the restaurant hasn't been open much since you filmed there....He gave excuses like crabs have been hard to get, and there has been a sign on the door for the last month saying "Closed Due To Kitchen Equipment Failure"....I felt the whole article was negative towards you and The Food Network..
Mr. Tom O'Connell you are incorrect. I am not bad mouthing The Food Network, Restaurant Impossible, or Robert Irvine. In fact Robert and I have been friends for quite a while. If you read this Facebook page, which I am sure you do not, then you will realize I have spoke to Robert many times, Thanking him, and others, for a wonderful job well done. As far as YOU stating "He gave excuses like crabs have been hard to get" If you read the article I did not say that. I say Its been difficult to get crabs,. I guess you don't realize, but it is Winter, Crabs are not easy to come by. I am very happy with the way the Food Network, and Robert completed the make over. It did in fact turn my business around, and Rascals is now on it's way to serving many happy new customers!!! Please next time you try to stir up things, try to get it right !!! Here's hoping EVERYONE watches Robert Irvine in Restaurant Impossible, on the always creative Food Network !!!
I was inspired by Worst Cooks to roast chicken breasts with French thyme and rosemary today. Served with mashed potatoes. I love roasted chicken with potatoes...yum. So, is French thyme different from regular thyme? Just wondering. anybody chime in....always thought thyme was thyme! Hope I haven't wasted your time! Ok, couldn't resist. hugs xxoo :))
Hello Chef! My fiancee are in full swing now with wedding planning and so fourth. Can you please inbox me your address so I can send you your save the date card and wedding invitation. I hope you remember us from Disneyland. Oh and by the way, I LOVE the new shows, just awsome.
Absolutely love the show... I just HATE your limited funds... Can't imagine to renovate a house kitchen for $10,000, so to even think about all the magic tricks involved in making a renovation to a restaurant with such limitations of $$$... Only you would try that and even pull it off! Next time ask for at least $20,000. 
Just remembering some of the Italian restaurants in Rockford, IL... And planning my next dish... It's BAD when a place doesn't have the money to buy food!!!!!!!!
Comment #2: Vanessa's work looks promising... (MUCH better than last week's decorator - awful). Lets see if see will deliver... Stressful, but good stress... Again, only you... it looks like a job for a month, very ambitious. I LOVE THE SHOW!!!!!!! Congrats. And the food you show the cooks to do looks delicious!
Ok, I want that pizza dough recipe! I'm dying here! =) 
Love this show!! Addicted just like we were to DI and how we are to WC all over again! Robert....you are amazing!! 
That new designer tonight, KEEP HER AROUND! Great job, she needs to hang out with you to get the "speed" down that you work at. She did a great job taking the budget hits and rolling with it, found great solutions. Those simple but awesome recipes for those courageous untrained chefs was inspired, I think they will knock it OUT. This was a great episode. Better than last week by far!!
Wonderful show Chef! You have such a big heart, you give people back the hope they have lost and renewed the spirit they have had broken. Keep up the good work and for all you do you will be blessed :)
Even better then last week, designer Vanessa was way better. Love what you did for Jerry, hope U guys enjoyed your beer. Til next week.
What impressed me the most was the compassion you showed the owner and staff there ( when compared to the OTHER restaurant make-over show). Showing compassion and giving support seems to go a much longer way than screaming, yelling and belittling. Keep up the good work.
great show you are the master at compassion. The makeover was great, it made the place look so much brighter and the table ideas were great added a nice touch to the resturant and you sure gave the designer a limited budget and she worked miracles for you. Glad to see another success. question: does the resturant have to know you are nominating them, I have one, and no one goes there and the food is so so cant imagine how they stay in business
Loved the show Chef... just the amount of intensity needed to motivate the staff, and excite the viewers. But my favorite part was your sensitivity to the family and those passionate about the restaurant. You kept them hopping, but gave them such a wonderful level of respect. Your lessons to the chefs in training were perfect - easy to follow and encouraging. Can't wait for the next one. 
Great show! We all watched it together. It feels like you were just here! 
I feel Chef Robert, Anne, and Bobby Flay Would make a great 3 of the most awesome Chefs T.V. Show all together
Hi chef,love the restaurant and ms.DeLeon is the best for your team.I like this Rest. Than the first this one is very elegant. Chef you proof that you are the best .My admiration to u and your staff.God bless you.
Great RI tonight Robert....that place came back from the brink of nowhere. Keep me in your thoughts tomorrow....going again to do the foot/ankle surgery @ 1300...I will update you when the 'fog' clears from my brain....hahahahaha!!!! Hugs! xo <3
I think it is so funny when someone with a failing restaurant says something like, but ALL OUR customers LOVE that dish, we can't cut that ; ) (all 3 of them?) This family and staff seemed to be very receptive and appreciative for all your team's help. That was nice. Great job Chef!! Loved the laminated maps on the tables the designer did. That is stretching a dollar but making it look great! Made a great fillet of Beef tonight w/roasted potatoes - YUM!!! G'nite Chef!
Wonderful show ! Kudos to your team . Tracy and Joey great job. 
chef robert just tweeted this.....Forgot my I phone so I could face book durrr silly man robert ! But will get it today ! He will be back to posting later on today......
Last nights show was awesome!! glad you went with a better designer this time. Vanessa did such a wonderful job with the budget that she had! She knows how to use her imagination! Loved the show! Can't wait for next week!
Everyone here already knows Robert is amazing!!! He has many good qualities that what makes him a very interesting Chef/businessman. On last night's Restaurant Impossible we saw a softer side. He show respect, and understanding for a very good man, owner of Mainelli's. I felt Robert also did an excellent job with the staff. The ending was truly heart felt. I must say, it made me cry. Thanks Robert for helping everyone at Mainelli's. They truly are "Good People". 
hey robert i figure away to watch RI and i have to say i love the show 
Just wanted to make a comment about last weeks Rest Imposs. I was just about ready to climb into my tv and kick both of those designer/decorators in the ass! Painting those chairs was a joke! Are these qualified designers? Are you kidding me? My 8 year old couldve done better than that! However, you were awesome, Robert!
Chef, a question I have always wanted to know the answer to...... Do you have a favorite football team? (Proper football, like from back home, not the football they have here in North America :P ) Keep up the good work mate!
Hi Chef, I am Blane's wife. Just want to know that I Love Love both the new shows Worst Cooks in America and Restaurant Impossible. I have been watcing you when you did Dinner Impossible. Keep up the great work. Hope to meet you sometime. Blane talks highly of you.
Hope you have a very fun weekend at the Food and Wine Fest Chef!!! Was wondering...I know Atlantic City has a Food and Wine show any plans for you being at this years event?
Just thought Id say hi
Then, I don't get much support when I do wish to do new things at home. My mother and grandmother whom I live with don't quite understand the need to eat healthy, and what a lot of what we are consuming is doing to us. My mom in particular is really really picky, and won't change her diet habits to save her life almost quite literally, which concerns me I must say. So this is also a challenge. I really want to change some of this though and stick to it, but don't quite know where to start. About the only thing I really make on my own with any type of regularity that involves a pan, is scrambled eggs, and even that I sometimes lack the patience for. Everything else is more or less, from a can, a box, lunchmeat from the local bakery, or from a restaurant or takeout. Do you have any advice you could give me here, and perhaps some simple recipes to get me started cooking with a bit more regularity? 
Hey Chef Robert, just stopping by to let you know that Ashley presented me with the book. Thank you so much for your kids words, i have to be honest it really choked me up.. You are truely an inspiration to me as a cook and i sure hope that when Ashe and i bring Gracie to Hilton Head i have the opportunity to shake your hand... Cheers and i cant wait to read the book
Chef Robert Wanted to write and say thanks. Mainelli's has been off the wall... full house last night and tonight, with the phone ringing off the hook with reservations (the book is coming in very handy). As you taught us, in a very competitive business you must be exceptional; just good enough, is not good enough. A few little hiccups during the rush, but all in all a good experience for all. Everyone that came in loved the food and could not stop talking about the show. Are you flying our of PVD on your way home from the Sun Food and Wine fest? If so why don't you stop by and see us on your way home. Thanks again, Chris 
Had an X-ray done today, and they found you in my heart. The Doctor said if they took you out, I would die, because I could not live without such a good friend...Give this heart to everyone you don't want to lose in "2011" including me, if appropriate. Try to collect 12 it's not easy!....Tell at least 6 Friends that they are important to you and let's keep this going......... Remember Tomorrow is Never Promised!! 
Hi Chef! I was just at Mainelli's and they had a full house! Everyone is buzzing about the show. I hope you are having a great time at Mohegan.
Hey Chef Robert! I've had a Dinner: Impossible-watching spree over the weekend. :) I could not stop thinking about the Beef Tenderloin with Costa Rican Coffee Balsamic Fig Glaze you guys made for the Caffeine Crash episode for about three straight days now! Thanks for never failing to make my mouth water (and never stop!)!
Chef, if I am only getting one book right now? Do you suggest: Impossible to Easy - - OR - - Mission: Cook! first? I will get both eventually, just have to start with one ; ) and - will your Spice Blends ever BE available again?
Hey chef, saw your demo yesterday at the sun winefest. You had mentioned u and jacque torres knew each other for awhile. Just curious, how long have you known him, and how did u meet him. He seems like a great guy. Look forward to seeing you both at the bon bon thing tonight.
All I can say is "OH MY!" Just saw the preview for this Wednesday's RI episode!!! My mouth dropped...Looks like you had your hands full on that one! Can't wait to see. :)
We were coming back down to casino tonight, wished you were still there to get a beer. Safe travels Chef!!!
Just watched the show from Wednesday night and it was so good!! The family had so much heart, and I must say that the cook had a passion and drive that touched my heart! I loved that you pulled the dishwasher into the mix and helped him find the confidence to push forward in the kitchen! Another success : ) Love it!

Chef, you have rubbed off on my husband. (You are a serious addiction in our house!) Ive been bed-ridden sick for the last week and my husband picked up your book "Impossible to Easy" to read while I recouperated... OHHHHHH goodness, the recipes left me drooling... Im making your Cauliflower Soup (sans the butter, dairy issues) to bring with me when I return to work tomorrow. Cant wait to try the rest of the recipes!!!
Really great show tonite Chef Robert, movers and shakers, will miss Kelly"resembles reese witherspoon". Loved all the different foods, makes me hungry, lol. If I were on worst cooks I'd be the first one out, lol. Til next week, take care.
Goodness did Ty scare me...I thought he was a goner!!! Scraped by through the skin on his teeth me thinks tho. I'm hoping Ty ups the ante and brings his A game. I really would like to see him take it! Overall i think everyone is doing soooooo much better and did an incredible job tonight. They all have come a very long way. 
Chef, I must say I love the new Restaurant Impossible Show!!! I think it is a wonderful show and a chance to change lives for the better putting right what went wrong and giving their dream a second chance...it must be amazingly rewarding to know you may have saved their livelihood and dream congrats Chef Bravo!! and don't let up on the pressure!!! my wife says "ha he sounds like you" lol go figure must be the Marine in me lol
Hi Chef! I saw what you wrote on Twitter that you landed at LAX and you seem to have almost no voice, so as you try and relax tonight have some hot tea, I recommend cinnamon with lemon and maybe a shot of tequila in it ;) Get some rest. 
Wow! I was so impressed with Georg's performance in tonight's episode! All of her hard work is really starting to come together! Your teaching really seems to be having a big influence on your whole team. ^_^ I'm definitely looking forward to next week's episode! And I also second that tea idea. My favorites for a sore throat are chamomile with some honey, or peppermint. Hope you feel better soon Chef! Don't feel too jet-laggy! XD
great show, the more and more I watch the more I believe you and Anne are a great match up, my son wants to know if I am going to be on the next season so he can get a better meal, maybe he should go on ha ha. was totally impressed how far everyone has come keeping an open mind, hoping ty steps up his game. good luck everyone Go Team Robert
hello Robert how are yo doing so i figuer out away to watch RI WC iam very happy now that iam not missing out i love both show
Chef, I feel the need to let you in on a little secret. When I was choosing my photos to represent 2010, I had to choose between meeting you at Disneyland's Food And Wine Festival, and Meeting Guy Fieri. ... I chose you. =) <3 Which reminds me. If you are in Southern California again in April or May and would like free tickets to the Renaissance Pleasure Faire, just let me know. ;)
 Hello Chef....another great episode, dying to see who takes it all! Wishing you and everyone here a magically delicious day =)
loved your show "worst cooks in america" last night. My dad used to always make potato pancakes when I was little and I have tried to make them myself but they have never turned out right, now after seeing you make them last night I can try again...lol. Cant wait till wednesday night to see your other show.
Chef- just wanted to ask for that easy pizza crust recipe you made for Mainelli's on RI? You said it was just couple ingredients. It would be awesome to know it. My kids would love that. thanks and we are really enjoying the the new show.
Chef Irvine, Bill and I want to thank you for the time you spent with us at the Mohegan Sun Wine Fest. It was a thrill to meet you and talk to you! We especially want to thank you for the time you spent with Jimmy. You made his year! He has not stopped talking about meeting and hopefully some day cooking with you! We are looking forward to dinning at EAT! the next time we travel to Hilton Head. Once again, thank you!!!
Finally had a chance to sit down and watch last Wednesday's episode of RI. What a difference two days make! Another great job done. You live up to my favorite saying...."Be the change in the world you want to see". Your strength, stamina, compassion and dedication truly shine through on RI. On WCIA you and Anne give us less then stellar cooks hope. Gonna try out those potato pancakes in the next day or so. Major snow storm coming, so just hunkering down and cooking....well trying anyway, ya i am one of the 'less then stellar cooks' I mentioned before. Have a fantastic day!
just wanted to let you know that it was an honor to meet you at Mohegan Sun. Also, the fact that you were shocked that I was as tall as you were will stay in my memory for a long time to come. I wanted to tell you that I was taken aback that you do all of your own responses online personally. You were just a very laid back and what a genuine, down-to-earth guy you are. Thanks again for spending time with us and with CT.

Hayden made your Upside-down Apple Tart for desert tonight. It didn't carmelize all the way, but was delicious anyway.
This chicken cacciatore was delicious and made my kitchen smell amazing! I made it using peppers left over from the beginning of the week (mostly red) but served it with whole grain spaghetti since that is what I had. I had to use the camera on my laptop, so the quality isn't the best.

The other day you posted a question about what we were making for New Year's also I only cook for myself & you gave me ideas about cooking for one. I called it Verna's Hamburger Helper: 1 box of Annie's shell's & cheese dinner,1/3 of a bag of frozen veggie's & a lb. of burger...Yum. I only use 2 pans & it's easy clean up =)
The 2011 WineFest @ Mohegan Sun was great. Your table was putting out a great sea food special to me " Cod Fish". Or Baccala!

hey chef! hope your new years went well. mine was relaxing and well spent with gracie. tomorrow starts day one on teaching myself how to cook. ive never cooked cooked a day in my life. if i dont, my lil one will starve lol. wish me luck!
Hi Robert. Just stopping by to say hello and HAPPY NEW YEAR from NC. Can't wait to visit Hilton Head. Gotta get there for a meet-n-greet with you. Anyone else want to come along?
Tonight, Sunday stay in or set your TiVo's!! R Favorite Chef Irvine is Back2Back on the FoodNetwork Starting at 8pm w/Iron Chef" then at 9pm for the season premier "Worst Cooks in America". Can't wait Chef, will get the popcorn & champagne ready!!
Just finished Dinner Impossible at the Candy Store!!! Love it Now....waiting for Worst Cooks and Iron Chef!! 
And it begins now.....

NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! Fix! :-P Oh Robert, you are my Iron Chef champ.
My hubby walked by the TV and stared open-mouth in shock when he saw the hand-pulled raw chicken! 
Fruity turkey ball spaghetti???
are you kidding me, what on earth are they cooking, and boy I feel sorry for those who have to eat it
Chef, this is Jim. Just finished watching Iron Chef, watching "worst cooks" now, and laughing every step of the way. Caught Dinner Impossible earlier today. Looking forward to Restaurant Impossible. Back to the show!
omg...they don't know their vegetables!
Just saw the preview for "restaurant impossible" and wanted to say how proud we are of you for taking the initiative to change peoples lives. It doesn't get any better than that. Relish every moment.
Going on Worst Cooks as a vegetarian with a fear of meat is like going on Survivor not knowing how to swim or build a fire.
So enjoying watching you on "Worst Cook" can't wait for "Restaurant Impossible!" I had the wonderful opportunity to meet you personally in Atlantic City NJ this past summer and I was soo honored!
Uh-oh....my husband is sitting next to me on the couch yelling at the worst cooks!!! LOL
This is not just for those who CAN'T cook! Lots of lessons and tips for those of us who CAN! :)
GOOD LUCK with Restaurant Impossible! - your Boston based crew. BTW,The mint pesto, to die for...
Oh My.....is all that comes to me right now...again a HUGE THANKS to my Mom for teaching me how to cook!!!! And a huge care package is on its way for u Chef...Some Pepto, Tums, and a huge bottle of Tylenol and a Vodka in case all else fails...GOOD LUCK!!!!
Is there still a place to buy your spices? We ran out of your roasted garlic pepper and we use it on so many different things. Please let me know if there is a place.
Wher can I bye your spices I am from Missouri Love all your shows!

It was awesome to see so much of you on TV tonight, Chef. Very entertaining, as always! Re-runs are great but there's nothing like a new show! Looking forward to the next several weeks and watching you and the blue team kick some culinary butt!
Hi Chef! Good to see some new stuff on Food Network! Can't wait for Restaurant Impossible! I hear there is no Food and Wine at Disneyland this year :( Any chance you will coming to So Cal for anything else? If you make it to LA or San Diego, please let us know! Hope you and your family had a great holiday and happy New Year!
Hey Chef. Any air dates for the Flood Tide yet ?
Dear Chef Robert, can you please send me a message to discuss the possibility of you catering my wedding? It wont be for a while but my biggest wish is for you to cater it. I know it will cost a lot but I want to at least discuss it with you before ruling out the possibility. Please help me make my dream wedding happen!!!!!
I am very impressed you actually take the time to answer the posts of your followers! When do you find the time? Good Luck on the stress test! I have had to have them done, was an interesting experience, but a piece of cake! You will have to hit Starbucks after wards. Love Deviled Eggs and I must admit I make really good ones! Please let us know how you make out. Doing the treadmill or the injection?
Hope that Stress test went well and did ya finally get your COFFEE!!!!!????
Good Morning Chef! Hope all goes/went well with the stress test. LOVE your heart and you exercise it so much giving to others and sharing with us. That has to keep it healthy!!!! BTIEA is already DVR'd but thanks for the heads up that you will be on this episode. (rarely watch live TV-zip thru commercials) Again, congrats on the shows last night and the upcoming ones. It's gonna be a GREAT season!!! Really enjoying watching and learning from you. (jacket on :( or off : ) BE Well my friend!!!!
At the "risk" of beating a dead horse into glue..... DOES ANYONE know what happened to Chef Robert's segment on Geraldo??? Was it postponed, cancelled or???? I watched last night's taping TWICE (the ONLY airing this weekend) and NO Chef Robert. I am beginning to suspect that this year is going to be a continuation of the END of last year :(
Hi Chef. I got a couple questions for ya. i saw your post about the deviled eggs on the best thing i ever ate. i love deviled eggs and so does my family. i sometimes have problems with them being lumpy or the yolk being to thick that it wont squeeze out of a pastry bag. do you have any suggestions or a fav recipe of your own that i might be able to try. aside from the one on tonight of course. lol. also is resturant impossible replacing dinner impossible? i love dinner impossible. hope you have a great day i hope everything went great with the stress test and you finally got your coffee. 
Hiya Chef... Was wondering if you're gonna be at the South Beach Food & Wine Fest this year?
In case you've forgot, tonight's episode of The Best Thing I Ever Ate, "Reinvented Classics", will feature Robert and Founding Farmers' delicious Devil-ish eggs. If you're in the DC area, stop by Founding Farmers to enjoy some awesome food, drink and of course tonight's episode (starts at 10pm). I hope to see you there! 
WELL!! Look at all the stuff I miss when I don't spend so much time on-line! You are on Twitter (me too, Iamsilysandy) and you go and have a stres test...tho I made sure I did not miss you last night!! Hate to tell you this, I don't think I can cut up a chicken so well. Your expressions were PRICELESS when you "tasted" all that stuff....YOU are brave my friend. BRAVE!
Chef Robert - Loved the Worst Cooks show...can't wait for the new Restaurant Impossible! I want to try the bacon fat ice cream, scallop and lobster dish...what the heck was in that again!? I knew I should have DVR'ed it!
Hello everyone! Just watched the food channel tonight and enjoyed "The best thing I ever ate" show.....when I saw Chef Robert I remembered the Dinner Impossible shows and how I really thought they were cool! I noticed when he came on...he has a restaurant on Hilton Head! I have family there and am looking forward to checking it out when I visit again! My Aunt had a restaurant in Bluffton (A German Bistro!)...so it was nothing for us to drive two hours for dinner and come back home! Hope to see ya soon! Ya'll remember to pay it forward and make YOUR day! 
that twist on deviled eggs was amazing, who would have thought
I just read about your trouble with the food network. I don't care what they think or say I still think you are a genuinely good guy and a great cook. I have watched you forever, and love how you keep cool and have fun with yourself and others. Someday I hope we cross paths!
Loved the new show. When are you going to visit the Bluegrass state? I have a Dinner Impossible for you. I have Crohns and Diverticulits. I can't eat anything with a hull, seeds, potatoes. I can have any type of meat, fish. See you can make me a menu. If you can you are a miracle worker. I'm so tired of carrots, sweet potatoes. 
Since I am new to Twitter, just let me tell you...my first received on the phone was from YOU last night!! And then I went to sleep!! Have a great day with Cassandra and her family! I know you will make all her wishes come true! 
Hi, Chef. I got to watch the your ICA episode and the premiere of Worst Cooks last night. The family and I were on our way back home Sunday night. Luckily, I set my DVR. I think you guys should have won ICA. The tarragon chips were amazing. I was able to try some. Delicious! After watching it live, I have such a newfound respect for the competitors and the crew of that show. There's a lot of work and many hours that go into that show. As for Worst Cooks, it looks like it's going to be a great season! Can't wait for next week. Hope you had a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Chef... I'm sick... Can u come make me some soup? lol 
I put the picture of you and the tiny little girl on my FB page. sooo cute. Good job tonight. Am thinking about doing the dinner. Possibly something more than just me. Have to talk to my Brit manager and see if she will give me permission. 
Chef Robert, Just wanted to let you know I am a big DI fan. Saw my first episode while on active duty, and was hooked ever since. Your Chefs vs. City episode, loved that too, lets just hope you don't have to deal with chitterlings again.
Chef - just watched Chefs vs. City where you and George competed. What a great show!! It was so fun to watch you compete in the challenges and I very much enjoyed watching the honest reactions to what you were given. Thank you so much for making such entertaining tv - you are a true pleasure to watch!! 
hey chef, chef chris here and I get energized by watching ur shows, how about a show to get fat guys in shape hahaha
My husband and I watched the Iron Chef with you and Anne Burrell last night that we recorded. You should have won! The bacon ice cream layered with seafood along with the claw meat looked awesome and so original! The plating was beautiful. At least Mike Symon lost the bet:)
Hello Robert & everyone! Latest course of action is the foot/ankle surgery was rescheduled for 21 January & surgery to repair torn meniscus in left knee will be scheduled as soon as I have rehabed well enough from 1st surgery...outcome for right thumb I get tomorrow morning when I see the surgeon handling that! On the bright side, my surgeon doing my knee gave me a prezzie! Since we have known each other for 19 years he gave me an extra pass he had so now I can park in the doctor's parking lot!!! Yippee! Now that I think of it I suspect he may have given it to me to keep me quiet! I have been known to be a bit of a terror in his office! All in fun though.....hugs! xo <3<3<3
Hey Chef, My son has his high school cooking final next week. He can make any dish of his choice, so he chose to make a pasta salad with spinach, feta cheese, garlic, oil... ( its one of his favorite dishes). He gets points for presentation. I was wondering if you had any suggestions on how to " pretty up" this dish, since it is not the most eye pleasing dish in the world. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Don't know if you are still filming Dinner:Impossible, but you should go to the FAAN (Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network) Convention. Not that tricky to cook for the allergy folks and some of these people will never have an opportunity to eat a meal of your caliber. 
Chef...just saw an ad for your newest project. Must be amazing feeling to take someone's dream that appears to going away and bring it back to them. Can't wait to see it.
great news southwest airlines is offering servivce to sc beginning in march YAHOO
Hi Chef I hope you are well and all your projects are going smoothly as we begin 2011. I was just wondering, do you have any say at all over the way the dinner impossible repeats are scheduled? I ask because I notice the way it's working out now as they've began reairing them on Wednesday evenings, that.....you end up getting the same episode 3 times a night now, since the 4am airing that has been there is on the same episode as the nighttime ones have been. It would make more sense to me to have a different episode in one of the slots instead of both being the same. I suppose it's wishful thinking that you could do anything about it lol, but just thought I'd ask. Happy New Year to you and yours. :)
Robert, Only 51 days left until SOBE Food &Wine Grand Tasting. Want to make sure I see you. How do I go about doing that? Do you have your schedule?
Also, Love the Worst Cooks of America. Nothing afgainst Beau, I liked him. But I was thrilled to find out you were going to be on it. Watching you and Ann try their first plates? Priceless!
Dinner Impossible last night...the guy who didnt cut the chicken all the way through and then was laughing about it would have been kicked out of my kitchen! You are a better person than me..lol. 
Welcome Back Chef Irvine. I wrote to Food Network when i found out you were gone & told them basically what a shame it was that they got rid of you. So glad your back! Dinner Impossible was not the same without you.
good morning chef robert this is cheryl justice i again wanted to thank you for helping me out when i was homeless in las vegas nevada and people say you dont have a kind heart you do your the best host for dinner impossible
Wow just saw the pic of you and Paula Dean.....new show idea....you the topless chef (just don't cook things that splatter) I would record and watch it on a loop. But really I learn something everytime I watch you cook. But you should be cloned and everyone should have one! If that ever happens...put me down for two. I did try one of your dishes and it came out great! I didn't hurt anyone and 911 wasn't called...so for me that is a HUGE success!
Hi Chef Robert. I just wanted to let you know how much we enjoyed ourselves last night at your restaurant for the Hargray Cooking Challenge. I was a bit nervous but you put me at ease making the cauliflower soup, which was so yummy!! Your restaurant and staff were delightful, thanks again for a fun night!
Chef Robert, you are a Prince among men...the time you spent with Cas was truly precious to her & to us, especially as we saw first hand how very, very busy you are. You by far exceeded our expectations of making her Wish come true and gave her memories to last a lifetime! Thank you so much for your valuable time, your generosity & for introducing us to the wonderful people you surround yourself with, like Blanche & Chef Lee. And I can't forget to say thank you for telling the kid onions are a STAPLE, lol - she refused to use them before, maybe now she will :)
hey chef...sent you that email...going out to cali tomorrow...let me know if you'll be there and we can catch a beer and a man u game 
Good evening!! I really can't believe the amount of horrendous food you must have put in your mouth during the filming of worst cooks!! I loved watching the clips from the auditions...rather you than me!! I hope they paid you a ton of money to compensate!! Booked a last minute trip home for 2 weeks, leaving on Jan 16th, so will have to miss the airing of RI, but hopefully the trusty DVR will not let me down!! Looking forward to some real fish and chips at home :) Hope you have a great weekend. 
Hoping your day is going well and the weather is better there then here....just watching the snow fall....looks like I am treadmill bound!
Just watched the first episode of Worst Cooks and it was great! I don't know how you eat the food though.
So Chef what's for dinner this evening??? I'm having NY Strip Steaks, candied carrots, pecan and herb rice, and rosemary garlic cheese stuffed puffed pastry :D
HEY robert so whats for dinner 2night.iam have chicken Parmigiana in a pomodoro sauce with veggies and side of green salad
I having this incredible craving for stuffed cabbage....looks like I need to do some shopping & make a supply....hugs! xo
Hope you have another warm and sunny day! Still super cold here, so a good day for french onion soup! Now to brave the grocery store.........
Hey Chef!.. it's been a while! Can't wait to see the new show tonight! YAY! lol So I have a few room mates now and one of which is an experimental cook like myself. We were talking about pork loin and he is considering some sort of a chocolate glaze over it? I told him I would ask your opinion on it. We normally use garlic and apples. Wanting to try something new.. not sure about the chocolate idea but I said I would ask :D
My daughter, Hayden (whom you surprised Thursday night at eat!) just got the rub on the ribs for your Tastiest Ribs... we'll post some pics when she's all done... what she really wants is to make you one of her apple pies that she's been making from scratch since she was 5! Thank you so much for taking the time to delight and inspire my "little chef"
Good Sunday afternoon to you Robert.....latest update....ankle/foot surgery is now 27 Jan...surgery to repair torn meniscus left knee as soon as I have sufficiently rehabbed from first one...decision still to be made on thumb...ah, good times....just got the apron from EAT! I have to say, your things are very good quality! I am impressed! Love you! Hugs! xo:):):)
Hello Robert how was church? Gonna watch worst cooks tonite.. I'm in Houston so I'm rootin for Ms Priscilla from Sugarland.. It's a county in Houston..
OK Chef, after seeing your piece on Philly's PARC on the Best Thing I Ever Ate, you have inspired this stiletto gal to check it out :) Any other great spots you love in Philly? Would love to hear your suggestions. 
I am having...flounder stuffed w/crab...grilled veggies and a salad...lov you shows...keep up with 'DINNER, IMPOSIBLE, please...
OMG - Did anyone see the PUMPPLE CAKE on Outrageous Food? Tom described it well, the "Turducken" in cake!!! It is a Pumpkin Pie baked inside of a Chocolate Cake AND an Apple Pie baked inside of a Vanilla Cake, stacked and frosted with RICH Buttercream Frosting!!!!!! Talk about a "Sunday Cheat"? Take a month of extra workouts to make up for that one!!!!!! WOW!!!!
someone is gonna lose a finger, and all that salt on the one omelet, ya know the girl who thinks eggs are gross
Brave man to taste that oily omelette!
yay! I loved it! Great show tonight! you rock! We're so going to make that pork and compound butter yum! and you have a few new fans tonight also! :D 
it was great! I was wondering about the recipes...looking for the compound butter and how long to cook the asparagus.. i promise I was paying attention chef!
Paul and I enjoyed the show. You've got to remember that you are an intimidating guy just cause your size alone, let alone your expert culinary pedigree and skills. What in the world did you have on your left pant leg?! It looked like it could've been a microphone wire. Looking forward to next week's show.
OOOOH great Iron Chef tonight I see....LOBSTER MY FAVE!!!!!!! Off to DROOL :D
Two steps foward, one step backwards, but they are learning. They try so hard, they forget a bit, but the show was real good, a learning experience for us too. Liked the pork chops better than the omelette. I think Ty and Kelly are excellent. Thank you Chef Robert.
Great show Chef, although some of those egg dishes on the farm scared me! The pork dishes looked good with the compound butter, too bad most of them messed the dishes up. Can't wait for next week!
Great show tonight!! seems they are getting better each show and you don't look like you want to spit every taste out!! Good choice on the elimination too! Loved how the notebooks were taken away in the middle!! Man the faces of them all was priceless!! 
Great Show tonight Chef, I'm wondering??? Do you like asparagus? I love it but I didn't see you eat any of it...lol
had my Husband watching tonight...Oh the looks he was giving the TV were priceless...And he has burnt his eggs on many of an occasion...That smell has to be the worst for me. makes my stomach turn...Seemed like they got better on the pork tho...But I have issues with pork myself. But hey...we all are entitled to our mistakes in the kitchen...Learning from them is what counts :D 
Holy Omelets LOL....Great Show!!! Im still CRACKING up about the missing piece of PORK..
I'm rootin for Ms Priscilla.. And i happen 2 think she is gettin better.. Team Priscilla!!!!!!! 
I just love dinner impossible! And no matter what you cook it looks great and I wanna be there to eat it! So I think you should have a contest where you cook for like 5 or 10 of your biggest fans, and I totally nominate myself for that!!!! :-)
Robert, You rock chef. My sister and I just think you're a kick butt chef and a charming guy. Thanks for making Food Network so fun. Hope you kill Chef Ann on Worst Cooks! Peace and Love! 
I haven't seen tonight Worst Cooks yet, but I did see the Dinner Impossible repeat tonight. The roller coaster one. It made me wonder just how long you have worked with George and David as you are so in tune to one another! Even repeats are wonderful! Keep doing what you are doing. Look forward to Restaurant Impossible!
Hope everyones night was better then mine! Due to high winds, lost power in the middle of melting butter for the popcorn to watch the show with. While trying to find a light source, knocked the pot of butter all over myself. #1-very messy #2-no power, no show and #3-ouch! Have a great day!
I am REALLY enjoying "Worst Cooks"! One thing I noticed is that you seem to have a different persona from D:I. In D:I we got used to high intensity, drill sargeant behavior, which would definately not work with these kitchen novices. You are showing the patience of a saint with people who are probably very intimidated to be in the kitchen with professionals like you and Ann! 
I recorded worst cooks, I've been at work that past couple nights. BUt I watch the first two this morning. HAAAAAAAA I could not imagine how the people felt cleaning up that kitchen!!
Omgoodness! How did your nerves and stomach hold out for the duration of filming Worst Cooks?!?!? And by nerves I mean, how did you not freak when people are nearly cutting off their fingers?!? EEK! I love the little lamb. "Baaaaaa-aaaad" LOL! This episode is so much fun and I'm not even through watching! Oh, and I love it when you just quietly go over and look at the rubber spatula while Georg is working. Subtle, got the point across, but funny. Great show! :)
just wanted to say HI Chef! hope ur having a gr8 day ;)
So I made this HUGE...ASS KICKING pot of chicken noodle soup!!!! Now to thicken it up and turn it into POT PIE filling :D man sooo good!!!
Hey brother. Is the episode of Restaurant Impossible that airs next week the one that we came up for? I got family that's wondering. Haha thanks for all you do, man. You inspire us all.
Okay Chef, you still want to play with the big cats? I do have the hook up for you. Not only are they in SC he is looking for a chef for the facilty. Maybe you can suggest someone. Because this is public I can't post the info. But email me and the digits are yours. Lets just hope all your digits are intact after!
This is the part where I shamelessly tell you it's my birthday, so you can say "happy birthday," but I will use the thin disguise of this cute story. Because it's my birthday, my son set his alarm 90 minutes early this morning so he could make me my favorite power breakfast: a Nutrigrain bar, half a grapefruit, and black tea, but I'm still wondering what he did for the other 85 minutes--LOL! I guess, being unfamiliar with food prep, he allowed himself plenty of time, just in case.
Hey Chef for lunch im gonna make some macaroni and cheese mixed with some hot dogs... what do u think?? lmao :)
awesome, Chef! Just read that your Extreme Makeover fundraiser SOLD OUT! Congrats, you are definitely the man!!
Hey Chef why haven't you posted the pictures that you posted on Twitter here? They are sexy, even with all the wires your hooked up ;) Your work outs have been paying off ;) I really don't know why people say that you don't have a heart because you have proven time and time again that you have a heart of gold. Muchos Besitios y Abrazos (Lots of kisses and hugs) to you Chef.
i just saw the pics of your stress test i hope you are ok chef
I love it how you're always helping people... Dinner: Impossible, you're helping people have a great meal... Worst Cooks In America, you're helping people to become great cooks... Restaurat: Impossible, you're helping people get their businesses (restaurants) back on track. You're truly a kind-hearted person. There needs to be more people like you in the world.
YUMMY medium-rare steak, baked potato & sweet english peas........... what a nice way to end the day!!! Hope your day was filled with much love and laughter as you have shared with us and so many others!!! G'nite Chef!!
This is going to sound odd but Robert did you just send me a message?
Trying my hand at beef jerky today! Wish me luck, lol!
When are you rescheduling the October Westin Weekend? We are ready!
Good Afternoon Chef. I need a little help with cooking squash. I made a Squash Cheddar Bake that I loved but my family did not, it tasted like Mac and Cheese with crisp bacon in it. The problem I was the only one who loved it. I need to know another way to cook Yellow Squash that my family will love. Help please!!
Okay Chef, the "editor" in me has to share ; ) (worked for McGraw Hill years ago) Went to your website to order an apron. While perusing, making my wish list for every other item, found an "oops" in DI DVD-1st Season description. Last line says: ".......viewers WITH see if Robert can make dinner: possible!" (emphasis-all caps added) The WITH should be WILL. 2 of 4 letters are right ; ) ".....viewers will see if Robert can make dinner:possible!" Have a GREAT day Chef!!!!!!!!
Watching dinner impossible; you sure have to deal with some food challenged people or just challenged people in general haha! Why do you put yourself in these spots haha jkjk but i do love how you deal with them!
Has there ever been a mission where the main person who gave it to you makes you so insane you could just throttle them? You're pretty incredible on these missions. I don't know how you can deal with such pressure.
Is there an air date for the Home Extreme you are working?
In the spirit of Chef Robert always telling us to do something good for others~this morning I'm trudging through the snow to catch my train to work when one of my boot laces comes untied. I had these thick mittens on, so I decided I'd retie the laces when I got on the train after taking off the mittens. Some woman I've never seen before on the train came up to me and said she didn't want me to trip on all the snow and ice, so she took off her gloves and retied my boot for me. TOTALLY MADE MY DAY!! So go out and be nice to someone today! I know I will!
Chef-did you and your crew cater lunch for the volunteers at the Extreme Makeover house? My son is a Marine and I am a friend of his former drill sargeant's wife who is down in Camp LeJuene. I guess a bunch of them volunteered to help and were treated to a meal that she posted a picture of...looked good! Just wondered if it was your handiwork
Hi Chef, just got off the phone with a reporter from the Edmonton Journal newspaper here in AB, Canada - they want to tell the entire province what a great guy you are too! She was asking about Cas's time with you on her Childrens Wish trip, I told her you were pretty busy with Extreme Makeover- don't be surprised if they call you too. Maybe if we get enough Canucks together we can convince Canadian Food Network to run Worst Cooks so we can see it here too!!
Hi Chef! I'm putting the finishing touches on my menu for next week. It's really been working out well so far. The only problem is that lots of my classes start late so they run through both lunch and dinner. I used my leftover chicken from a late dinner to make a homemade chicken noodle soup to take to class though, so I've been trying to be creative and resourceful! I have time to focus more on breakfast though, and I made homemade muffins this week which were delicious! Hope you are having a great week! Congrats on raising so much money for a deserving family!
Thank you to everyone, Robert, Carol, Chef Bart, Marc, Aaron, Kevin, Kenny, Jose, Greg, Matt, Brian(ice master), Norm, David and The Westin Team and all the guests for Making last Night awesome! 
Can I just say you truly inspire me. Not only do you make me want to be a better cook, (well atleast better to the point where 911 doesn't have to be called) but with all the good you do, you make me want to be a better human being. And I am sure I am not the only one that feels that. Keep up the goodness in you! 
Hey Robert, I think you're the most awesome-ist chef ever! I've made dishes from your episodes like: crossword crisis,barbie birthday,ice-cream meltdown, camp cook-off, pirates peril, elvis eats, magicians meal, and whole bunch of others. To quote another great chef, you really do make me feel like "anyone can cook"! You're a giant teddy bear that can do amazing things with a blade. To conclude, I WISH I could chop vegetables as fast as you!!
Happy Sunday, Chef. I have a question - if I were to buy your cookbook.(a couple of copies, perhaps?). . . could I send it to you to sign so I can donate to our charity fundraiser? It happens in February . . . we help Labrador Retrievers in need. Thanks! Hope you can make it to see the troops - my hubby will be home the end of March though (thank goodness)! Enjoy your day - looking forward to Worst Cooks tonight (and already have RI set on my DVR)! Cheers! 
Happy Sunday to you, Chef. My beer is chillin', the Bears are killin'...Its 18 degrees out and I've got the charcoal going for some good old ribs. Looking forward to tonight's show. I'm really looking foward to your new show on Wed. What a great idea! Enjoy your Sunday, Chef. Take care....

Evening Chef, Thank you for giving your time and efforts to one of our Marines and his family. With all of your commitments that I'm sure your obliged to, it's amazing that you can still find time to prepare those delicacies we all love and enjoy. I look forward to helping out and doing whatever I can on the job site in a few hours. Once again THANK YOU for all that you do and will continue to do for others. This project is proof positive that nothing is "Impossible" with a little hard work and some help from friends. "In a world filled with anger, deception, greed, and hatred. It's an inspirational sight to see so many come together and put forth so much, for the greater good of a few." "Everyone dreams, they allow us to go above and beyond our preconceived notions of what we "cant" do, living out your dreams, will always cast out those dreams about living" -Richard "DOC" Deeter Corpsman USN AD
May the Lord bless you, and keep you; May the Lord make His countenance shine upon you, and be gracious to you; May the Lord turn His countenance to you and grant you peace. "Sweet Dreams"
I love watching you before bed. Hopefully Robert will make a guest appearance in my dreams tonight! Goodnight gorgeous Robert! Sweet dream! <3<3<3 Nikki 
Good Morning Chef and everyone else on the CRI Official Page....Raises coffee cup...Have a great day!!! :D
Much of what we highlight on Food Frontiers takes place in labs just like the one highlighted in this article. Of the research profiled in the article, which sounded the most interesting to you?
Our journey on the path to zero does not end here. We have set ourselves purposefully stretching targets to unplug from the water grid, become fossil fuel free, reduce packaging and landfill waste and increase our use of renewables.
We have made good progress against the environmental commitments in our first report two years ago on climate change, water, waste and packaging. Our new report also identified new challenges such as agriculture and collaborative leadership, which we need to address.

HELP!!!! - Seriously - I GIVE UP!!! - The NEW caps on PEPSIE products HURT my hand just trying to open them!! Some are IMPOSSIBLE and I had to get a pair of PLYERS!! I am NOT kidding!! The other caps were PERFECT! I am sure the change was about saving money...they are definitely lighter weight construction. PLEASE CHANGE BACK TO THE ORIGINAL CAPS A.S.A.P.!!! Thank you ~ a loyal Diet Pepsi drinker
I hope the rumor I heard that you are omitting the words "under God" from the printing of the Pledge of Allegience on your new cans is not true. I am an ex-marine having served two tours in Viet Nam, the son of an ex-marine that spent almost three years in the south pacific during ww2. We served to protect our country and preserve our way of life for our children. I think it is UN-PATRIOTIC, as well as hipocritical to profess a connection to present day warriors and then to change the Pledge of Allegience, supposedly in the name of political correctness. I would hope that an icon of our society would do as much as those who served to preseve and protect our heritage. Maybe you don't want to be paid in greenbacks since it contains words like "in God we trust".

The brand "Farmers Markets" should belong to farmers markets that have built, from scratch,every market across america. Supermarkets etc are poaching, but Farmers Markets are doing their part to keep consumers smart. Hat Tip to markets that guarantee produce is local grown and supports local farmers... Give a shout here to your favorite farmer... with a link if you have it!

Local Farmers = safe local and ever more affordable, as inflation comes, food. thoughts? What is happening in your area to get MORE farmers? And do you see inflation in food in your area?
Interesting read.... honey bee issues, now bumblebees... 
as one of the consumers, I love farmers Markets. When I was quite a bit younger, we lived in Kenya,and would go to the "open market" once or twice a month to buy. It was everything you see in the movies, stalls of bananas, still attached to great stalks, piled to the rooftops, and every other tropical fruit you could imagine, meat vendors with trays of fresh, and I mean (ooh look mommy, they're killing that poor goat) fresh, meats for sale to the highest bidder. I loved it then, and here, back in the states, I love it now. Our version is much more civilized, and I'm ok with that. I meet new friends nearly every time I go to a Farmers Market. Produce, houseplants, fresh local fruits and veggies, garden starts, local crafts, and resale from everywhere... Walmart..suck it,I'm off to the market
Did you know we have a winter farmers market clear out here in Western Nebraska? This is our first year and we have a lot of supporters!! Check us out... ScottsbluffWinter FarmersMarket 
I'm looking for a variety of opinions, thoughts, tips etc..Trying to decide which method to go with for seed starting this year..kinda narrowed it down to trying a few different options so I can compare results etc but would like any suggestions. Do I go with Coir pots, CowPots, peat pots, make my own paper pots, sew my own cloth reusable grow bags, or the plastic trays/cells???? I've got some egg cartons saved as well as a few other containers I'll reuse so any advice would be greatly appreciated. In the past its usually just been peat pots, plastic trays/cells and last year I did a ton with recycled containers (containers from anything like milk jugs, oj, silk soy milk cartons, yogurt butter, plastic drive thru cups etc.). Thank you! 
From the Go Texan page, where they would not let me link to the article. Texas farmers markets are invited to apply for grants through Feb. 15 of up to $1,000 to host a GO TEXAN restaurant cooking demonstration. Ten farmers markets will be chosen and awarded funds. The demonstrations incorporate fresh Texas ingredients directly from the farmers markets, giving consumers an opportunity to taste and buy Texas produce and food. For more information contact grow.texan@TexasAgriculture.gov.

Someone mentioned to me that Iceland sold Stollen this Christmas but I didn't see it? Did they? Was it just selected stores?
can you please justify why my favourite packs of corned beef had gone up from 1 a pack to 1.50 a pack, a 50% increase in a week? x
Just watching Mary Portas Secret Shopper and am so glad that I don't provide that level of customer service in Iceland.
Thanks Iceland for my Kashmiri Chicken Tikka 50p off voucher, its in the oven cooking now. That's why us Men also shop at Iceland, not just mums!!! :-)
Best magazine love our Mini Jam Donuts! "These take just half an hour to defrost. Small, not too sugary balls with a varying amount of jam in each one. We dare you not to lick your lips." Brilliant Iceland value with 14 for only 1! http://ht.ly/3zduT

Twice now we've had the Iceland Chicken and Veg family pie and on both occasions its taken twice as long to cook as the instructions say. We've even had to put foil on the top as the crust cooked but the inside's still cold. Is it just me or have others had this problem?
Hi guys. Our local branch always seems to have new managers. I was wondering if certain branches are starter stores so to speak for new managers?
Or do they just not like our store :(

Tonight we had the Macaroni & Meatballs in chesse and pepper sauce. Was quite nice but we thought the meatballs seemed to have a greasy taste to them. Couldn't you spice up the meatballs a bit please?

Why do the tv adverts never advertise the bounus card or home deliveries? surely that would be good.
Apparently we're eating less marmalade than ever before! We ate 2.5m fewer hars in 2010 compared to 2009. Why? Because we're making more of it ourselves. In these tough economic times, what have you stopped buying ready-made and started making yourselves? We'd love to know! http://ht.ly/3JSuB

A year ago, immediately after Christmas, Iceland closed in my town, Weston-Super-Mare. We now have around 13 miles to travel to Bridgwater or maybe 15 to Portishead. When I emailed Iceland (as I had gift vouchers to use) they said they were looking at alternative buildings but, to date, we have no store. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS!
Hiiii My great love ;) I just wanted to thank you for the yummy, delicious and amazing food :) With the family here for 1,5 week and having to do the christmas eve buffet, christmas dinner, new years eve buffet and new years day dinner + ofcourse all the other days i can not tell you how much you have helped me (plus ofcourse saved me alot of penny's that i could splash on more gifts haha!) from the whole family (7!!) a big massive thank you and a happy new year! (They havent got an iceland, so had to give them the grand tour with pics in front of the poster haaha and they even bought things in my local and flew them home with them hahahahah!) As always iceland... I LOVE YOU! Happy new year!! Love, xxxx
id love to see iceland offer online ordering.....so much easier for busy working mums (like me) but also you are missing out on a massive revenue stream. I work for a company who are online selling specialists if iceland wanted to consider how this could improve their business?
just wanted to say how i love the hot choc i am now on my second jar in a week
Quick question for you now the 20% VAT has come how much will this affect the prices at Iceland. As we all know Iceland offers awsome prices and deals but how bad will the VAT going up change things
id love to see iceland offer online ordering.....so much easier for busy working mums (like me) but also you are missing out on a massive revenue stream. I work for a company who are online selling specialists if iceland wanted to consider how this could improve their business? No disrespect to any member on here but this comment although a good one flags up every other day on this message board. We know why Iceland wont do it. I think Iceland should make this clearer on this page. No offend to anyone intended.
missing the rip and dip pizza 
How often u supposed to get vouchers from your bonus,card? i nt been using long so just wondered
just wondered when we are getting our vouchers?????????????????got a txt b4 xmas saying i have earned all my gifts and they will be in the post soon??????????????????????????.

Woman magazine love our 5 Chicken Platter. "A chicken lover's must-have! Succulent meat & a lovely range of flavours." http://ow.ly/i/70i1

I think the bbq steak pizza would be fab and full of flavour!
Hickory Steak pizza
When I Go To Iceland With My Mum Every Body Is Singing That Why Mums Go To Ice Land And The Chirtmas Ad Tune So funny 
Just used the icelands 12 bacon and sausage rolls and found a wee bit of blue plastic in the middle of one of them sausages!! not very nice!! :(
i need a job any going ? i live in southampton thanx
bbq steak sounds better 
It be nice if iceland had store in berkhamsted :) 
as we were in the Que to pay today doing shopping my little boy turns tome and says mom i know why moms go to Iceland because they get free delivery bless him
Exert from Icelands website: Pure food ".We removed hydrogenated fats from our products by 2005, and are working with our suppliers to meet the Food Standards Agencys 2010 guidelines for salt reduction. NOT TRUE! I was about to consume Icelands Chocolate Orange Pudding and found this in the ingredients: 'mono and diglycerides of fatty acids unsure what this meant I did some research and found basically its 'hydrogenated fat' with a different name: http://www.treelight.com/health/nutrition/Mono-Di-Glyderides.html
This week, Ellie and the family have been trying our tasty Salt & Pepper Wings. Here's what they had to say: "Jodie rated these wings 10/10 on taste and Luke said he liked eating it off the bone like a dinosaur They were a perfect size for children to nibble on. I felt the seasoning was perfectly balanced and there was still a good amount of meat on them. They are quick and easy to cook and I rate them 10/10 for value." So why not give them a try today?
Hi all, Would like to know if there are any plans to refurbish the Truro store. Went there recently and was very shocked at how out-dated, depressingly dark and tatty it was :( Truro is a great city and this store just lets u down, staff nice there though ;)
hi, was just wondering how you become a taste tester for iceland x
so are icelands butting the deliver amount up with the fuel increase you have to ask your self will it be 30.00 or 40.00 to cover cost STOP the govement ripping us off join the petion for keeping fuel cost 1.00
Since when aren't Managers allowed to Question and Challenge, Mines been told that if she trusts and learns instead of questioning and challanging and then keeps quite then they can have a great year.. 
Just would like to comment on your Ham, cheese and onion potato bake from frozen, very delicious, however they was an over-powering flavour of onion through out
Woman's Own love our Pub Grub range! "All your favourite pub dishes without a trip to the local. Choose from Gammon Steak topped with a tangy chilli and pineapple sauce and with crispy wedges, slow-cooked Beef Bourguignon with rice or a Cumberland Sausage swirl with cheddar and chive mash." http://ht.ly/3zcJn
Does Iceland sell a hot chilli sauce that is also sold by Iceland in their Costa Blanca outlets in Spain.
Hi iceland i used to get cheese+onion mash for some reason they stop doing it in october last year just wondered if they will be bringing it back as it was nice i miss it xxx

Sound off on workout clothes: do you buy special outfits or just wear old t-shirts and shorts?
We're big fans of versatile foods. Tell us what YOU can do with a simple English muffin. 
What is the best investment you've made in your health so far this year? Gym membership? Fancy scale? Good running shoes? You tell us.
Have you been searching for products with the new PointsPlus values? Well, youre in luck! Try out Weight Watchers yogurt, snack cakes and cheese products at your local Kroeger, Wal-Mart, Stop n Shop or Safeway this weekend. Its a great way to find a new favorite! Check your local store for sampling event details.
New habits can be time-consuming to develop. What new things are you bringing in to your life this year and how will you make them stick?
Watch for our new packaging featuring PointsPlus values to hit stores soon! Love to hear how it's working for you.
How does a full fashion makeover in NYC sound to you? Check out the Progresso Facebook page for the full rules, enter for your chance to win, and learn about the only soup endorsed by Weight Watchers!
has anyone heard how to figure the points plus for Dreamfield's Pasta? It has what they call "protected" carbs that aren't utilized...has minimal efect on blood sugar. If you calculate it by the 5 grams of digestible carbs it claims, that makes it only 1 pointplus per serving. ( I am sure this is just too good to be true!)
Wish for next year's Points Plus calculator...LARGER buttons, make it Easier to press the buttons, and change the format of calculating on the calculator in the order as the entries appear on a label: Fat, Carbs, Fiber and then Protein. That would make it much faster and easier to calculate. I do love that you added the multiplier, and it calculates multiple servings correctly this time! Happy New Year! Cheers! 
The most important thing I learned in 2010 is that I am my worst enemy...not my friends or family. Just because they like to eat out and I like to go with them, I don't have to follow suit with what they are eating. Stay calm, keep my head straight and I CAN make it through a meal without crashing! 
Anyone have any suggestions on American Cheese? The WW is so pricey. Any other brands with low point value? thanks
can anyone help please, how many propoints is a tesco mince pie? Xxx
I can't seem to find out points on coffee with creamer and sugar, please help!!! I need my coffee but don't want to mess up my whole point system by drinking to much.
I learned that I CAN forgive myself.....I just have to "dust" myself off, and move on and get back on the program like it never happened. However, my problem is, it is hard to forgive myself the day that I go off the program. Once I go off during a day, and lose focus of how many points I had just eaten during that day, the day is shot. I can forgive myself starting the NEXT day. That shouldn't happen. After being a lifetime member for a year, I shouldn't be at that stage where one slip up during a day should ruin the entire day...that is my resolution to find out what triggers that way of thinking. Even though I get 49 extra points, it still doesn't matter. Anyone have that problem? 
About to start again. Hoping to regain my strength and get the weight off and leave it off this time. Was wondering if anyone would love to be ww friends on their facebook profiles for support, if so add me, just add ww to your message. Hope to meet some new friends
Girls..... awesome page! Love WW foods and working out! I just finished P90X work out and it was awesome. i'm kind of feeling the soreness already! i'm going to incorporate it 2-3 times a week with cardio on alternating days- does that sound good? thanks for everything :) I have a degree in Nutritional Science and looking to network with like minded people. Friend me if you like.
anyone sticking to the old points program??? I have read alot of discouraging remarks about the new points plus program.
Can someone tell me how many cups do I add of dry penne pasta when the recipe calls for 1/4 pound of dry pasta? I dont have a scale yet.
are there any promotion codes to get a discount if joining online?
Just started Weight Watchers today! Hubby is doing it, too! Hoping to lose at least 50 lbs!
wondererd if anyone can help me, i want to lose a bit of weight, am not fat by any stretch of the imaganation but just wana lose some to feel more confident. whats the minimum you have to lose b4 u can sign up? i dont want to go to a meeting and get laughed at and told to leave. thanks x
New routine underway...Take Buddy 4 a long walk (Check), Stretch & Shower (Check), Cook healthy lunch (Check) Cooking Healthy Breakfast...underway (2 slices of whole wheat toast w/2Tbl Peanut butter & 1 Sliced banana) Yum! :)
Getting back into eating normal after the holidays. Lg Bagel w/ cream cheese 11 points, an 8oz class OJ 3 points....Have lite yogurt and fruit in the house....And have vegies and chicken as well. Planning on plain chicken soup in the house. I love it when I make this soup because the you can add rice or pasta if you like. I always cook the rice or pasta about half an hour before I am ready to serve it because not everyone in my house wants those two things. You can add vegies to it when you start cooking it. I start it in the cock pot in the morning. Depends on what else you put into it depends on the points. 
Does anyone know, I just signed up for weight watchers online, does that include the meetings? I would like to go to 1 at least to learn about these points.
I'm finding that my desserts are now too many points with the new system. Does anyone have good dessert ideas that are now 2 or 3 points? They must include chocolate. ;) Thanks!
Are the new PointsPlus products in the supermarkets yet? I have checked several of the stores where I shop and can only find the original points products.
just made humgry girl lean bean n cheese burritos! delish ! they r 4 pts plus for 1 but filling ! i tripled recipe andm ade 6 for lunch for the week! I hate wasteing ingredients!Its in the 200 and under book!
joining tonight! already went to the grocery store so i'm stocked up and ready to lose!
took cycling tonight and earned 12 activity points:) Step is tomorrow and that is another 12 points! Go get out there and exercise!!!!
Girls....Awesome page! Love WW foods and working out! I just finished P90X work out and it was awesomeeee. i'm kind of feeling the soreness already! i'm going to incorporate it 2-3 times a week with cardio on alternating days- does that sound good? thanks for everything :) I have a degree in Nutritional Science and looking to network with like minded people.

I am 22 years old. Used to be 120lbs then I had 2 children & I gained 80lbs. I have lost most of it but I stilll need to lose 20 more lbs but it seems like I have hit a rock & can't lose it! Any suggestions? I just hate looking in the mirror at myself. I am kinda disgusted at the way I loook. Exspecially my stomach(after 2 pregnancys) :(
I just bought a Pampered Chef Large Bar Pan...it's the "seasoned" ceramic one. Anyone have any tips or recipes??
I haven't signed up for WW yet but I would like to find people in my area who have weight loss goals that I could team up with. I'm told support partners make you more succussfull. Anyone in lower southeast Michigan? Message me so we can connect.
I just signed up today and frankly am confused by the calculator. And it seems like 2 out of 3 items I try to enter are not there. I was expecting a points table or easy look up and am at this point just discouraged. Tips for using this system properly? Thanks in advance 
I could kiss the scale, down 1.4 pounds, 1.2 pounds away from 30 pounds, and 5 pounds from there from goal :) I indulged over the holidays but even when I did I made other good choices so the plan does work...
Is it importrant to use all your points for the day? So far, I have points left at the end of the day. 
Happy New Year........wish me luck....I am a lifetime member....who fell off the wagon.......my New beginning starts today.
Ok i just joined after the shift so does anyone know if the new pkg started in texas anf how would i know new from old since i never did the ols 2 know the difference.
I posted a question asking for help and Mbolo Don decided to rude all I was told I was too fat! Duh this is why im here lol Dont know why people join a page just to talk down to people. Free feel to block this person to help get them off our page! I did 
I would like to know about WW points... 150 lbs 20 pts a day is on or change? I used to go to WW few years ago and I am back on my own.. Need to know the update about points per day.. Stll 35 flexpoints per week? Feedback will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
anyone have a good recipe for Tilapia?
Well thank goodness the holidays are OVER ! Put on a couple pounds but not stressing over it! Today is my weigh in day and the start of my WW Week so i am back on track! Had the munchies when i got home from work but went straight to 94% Fat Free Microwave Popcorn ..... Great Filler until dinner!
I was a Lifetime Member back in 1985! Then just drifted, and finally lost 50 pounds on my own 4 years ago. But then my mom died, and I found myself gaining weight. After gaining 15 back, I decided to get proactive and go back to Weight Watchers! I'm nervous, and a little ashamed that I can't do it by myself again, but proud that I AM doing it...
think that the new plan is great. unlimited fruits makes life alot easier . been a lifetime for 14 years and so far this is the best. now i just have to see if that i don't gain weight eating too many fruits
I have never tried weight watchers but, I went to a meeting tonight and I am encouraged. Now I just need to plan my meals to not exceed the points allowed per day
Does frozen fruit still count as zero points on the new plan?
Guys, I just started WW today and am looking for any tips or good recipes for the plus program. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
love Weight Watchers!!! been on life time for 4 1/2 years and recommend it to anyone interested in changing their eating habits!
Quiestion I am hoping someone can answer this for me, I just signed into Weight Wagtchers today and I went to my firswt meeting. I forgot to price the weight watchers books, Can someone please tell me how much the member kit cost? i called the 800 number and they have no idea on prices. I appreciate any help :)
I'm new to Weight Watchers as of Nov. 30,2010 and I'm loving it ...lost almost 11 lbs so for and I'm not hungry at all and I actually have some points left cause to full to use them all. I never ate 3 meals a day before and the fruit to eat..Whoopee!!!..Just Loving It!!!!
I just started WW Monday night was my first meeting....I am kind of confused because they were out of the calculators at the meeting so I have to wait until next meeting to purchase one I have been watching best I can by using the meal plan in the getting started pamphlet wish me luck! I want to wish everyone who has started Good Luck. Have a great Day God BLess: )
I have done ww about a year ago on my own and lost about 20 pounds. I've been trying to get back in the rythym of it again since gaining it all back and then some. I finally went to the store and bought some ww items and more fruits are being eaten in my diet. I am just wondering if I can stick to the original points system? My mom helped me a lot b/c she is lifetime and had all the books and things I needed.
ok i want to know your fav. cheep quick and easy go to recipe suggestion, just started back on WW yesterday loving the new plan just hoping to see -5 for the first week! i need to loose 60 to 80 but I'm not going to look at the big #'s right now just the 1st 5 for now! 
Just started ww ! Any tips for quick easy meals as im a university all day everyday and get home late tea is always a quick meal ? Thanks :)
i just figured out applebees 550 and under menu is great! Not only do they have weight watcher items with the new pts plus , i figured the pts plus values for the 550 and under menu. Grilled shrimp and island rice being the least with 9 pts and the most at 13 was chicken teriyaki pasta and the signature sirloin. the others were 10 and 12!
I'v been reading that some as actually gained weight the first week of being on the new point systems....How many of you actually has gained weight the first week.....I'm still doing the old one just started back on monday....Debating if I should give the new plan a try ...
Hi all! I just started today and want to know from the group: What are the must haves to keep in the house. I plan to actually start this weekend after I get my 1st weeks meal plans planned :) 
is fruit unlimited?
Are the weight amounts for pasta for cooked or uncooked? I am guessing cooked. It is telling me I can have 4oz. of pasta for a serving.
When I enter the nutirtional info into the points calculator, it says 1 pt. If I look it up in ww's book, it says 4 pts. Does anyone know why that is? Maybe alcohol PERIOD is 4 points. 
Just saw my first points plus smart ones box...are all of them going list the points on the back of the box...not very smart planning.
does anyone know how many points are in iceland sweetened squirty cream???
why does the new complete food companion show light beers as 3 points but when I use the calculator it shows 1 point?
I did not have a good week. I ate everthing i should not have and did not get to the gym.I hurt my back last weekend and i am pretty sure i have a kiney infection. I hope i get back on the wagon soon. I had lost . Went from 186 to 164 . Seems like nothing is going right . Not a good stat for the new year. MY husband is going to take me on the genral jackson for our 14 anv and i have two graduations this year. gatta get it in gear soon .ARRRRRRRR just so mad. OH well thanks for the vent.
I got the Dark Chocolate Raspberry bars tonight...TO DIE FOR!!! and only 2 points!! I'm thinking THIS could be the 'thing' I go to when I need a chocolate fix!!
Ive had a bad week! I did so good through the holidays, I think getting the flu helped. But now that I am better I think since I didn't eat much for a while I am starving and have eaten so much this week. Tomorrow is my weigh in and Im so afraid to face the scale, its so discouraging. But Im going to weigh in, I need the support of my fellow WW members. tomorrow is a new day and Im so getting back on track! I love this page!
Hungry Girl on cooking channel at 4:00 Pizza Episode. 
 Girls.....awesome page! Love WW and working out! I just finished my work out and it was awesomeeee. i'm kind of feeling the soreness already! i'm going to incorporate it 2-3 times a week with cardio on alternating days- does that sound good? thanks for everything :) I have a degree in Nutritional Science and looking for support buddies.... Friend me if you like. ( :
I went to my first meeting and just wanted to let you all know nothing is on sale anymore everything is now full price the calculator is now 16.00
I have a wonderful family and we get together often. Trouble is, it's always over noshing of food. After Thanksgiving and Christmas, I'm psychologically spent now with an invitation to a ham biscuit supper. Do I eat before I go and feel deprived or take a Smart Ones meal with me to eat while they're eating? This scenario happens over and over.
So what are you taking to a Super Bowl Party where they'll be plenty of carbs and fats.
hello add me fitness conscious peoples..want to share tips and relations...
The 3 Musketeers Mint bar is listed as 2 pt.s but when I calculate it out, looking at the wrapper, it is 4. What's up?
Hi! i am wondering if anyone would like to share their one of their fav snacks or food items and put the point value next to it. i am looking for some new snack/ food ideas! :)
Well here I am again. Really having a hard time "NOT" being hungry. I have realized that I am a "Volume" eater. Any suggestions on filling foods that seem to be low in points? I am trying really hard, and I know that we are suppose to be able to eat fruit, which I love, but being a diabetic this is not going to work with my sugar levels. Salad has not been filling to me, more like air. I am really in need of support right now. I really want to do this. HELP!!!
Are the Veggie flatbread's at DD healty!! I have had them and the are fulling for breakfast! Any comments?
Tammy, I am a volume eater also, I try to make a batch of veggie soup and keep some frozen (no points) I throw whatever I have. It is quick and easy. Jolly Time popcorn also helps. But pickles are my live safer, no points, crunchy and salty. Hope it helps.
I live in Maryland, outskirts of Baltimore and I bought the WW's bagels 4 points with tne new packaging this morning!!
Just joined on Friday and I'm loving it. I feel it helps you manage portion control. I have joind for the 7 day free trial. Any tips or advice for first timers? 
Hello everyone! I will be thankful if you comment my articles http://weight-drop.blogspot.com I just want to be good writer :)
Just joined today! Any recipe suggestions for lunches to take to work?
Ok WW friends! You have 50 minutes left to get your free lip balm! Go to the facebook page "One Bath And Body" and join their page, then tell them Amy Bosen sent you and you get a free lip balm! Easy as that! And...it's 0 points! Haha!
Simply raw and refreshing. Low in calories too! http://www.thehealthydish.com/2011/01/09/sunday-breakfast/
what's this about a new plan WW has? anyone wanna share?
I'm putting a limit on eating : Bread, sweets.& fried foods,no sodas,with God's help I will survive!!
I could use some ideas for getting in 3 milks, buying the shakes is expensive.
I took a work out class this semester 3 days a week and I am taking total adavatage of the fruits and veggies being free points so I eat alot of those thats what I am doing this new year!!! 
I am not keeping snack foods in our house, instead I am keeping plenty of fruits and veggies. I also started working out 4 nights a week.
I just joined WW so any tips I should know about would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks
Does anyone know how many point wine has with the new point system, according to the calculator it's zero points, and I know that is not right.
Just started back on weight watchers and am so excited for support through facebook. Not used to this new points plus program but I think I'm doing ok so far....lost 4 pounds my 1st week. Thanks for all the post and good suggestions. 
started the older version of weight watchers at beginning of year wondering whether or not to do newer version what is the difference..harder? easier?
Just a quick question about the calculator. I have seen a few posts that say you have to have the calculator for the new WW. But I have been able to use the calculator on the WW mobile page. Is everyone using the calculator you have to purchase?
where can i buy weight watchers food other than bread in ontario, in our grocery stores?
how do you measure popcorn? with the scale or by measuring cups? 
Wondering how everyone does their meal plan. Do you plan your day out at the beginning of the day. Or just add up your points as you go along. I have done both. I kind of like planning the day out ahead of time. Less thinking through the day and just look at my planner and make what is there. I use pencil just in case I want to change something. Anyone else do this?
Girls.....awesome page! Love WW and working out! I just finished my work out and it was awesomeeee. i'm kind of feeling the soreness already! i'm going to incorporate it 2-3 times a week weight training with cardio on alternating days- does that sound good? thanks for everything :) I have a degree in Nutritional Science and looking for support buddies.... Friend me if you like. ( :
I am wanting to grill some chicken breasts on the foreman grill. I would like to grill them in a "buffalo wing" type sauce. Anyone have any suggestions? 
Hey! Does anyone have a great dessert that I can make to bring to a dinner party? Prefereably a Chocolate one...
Okay so I have a lunch meeting today. We are going to Applebees. I know they have a weight watchers menu. I will double check the points on things, I found a menu with Nutritional breakdown online. My question is what if I don't eat my whole meal and want to take half of it home for say lunch tomorrow. Can I count this as half the points value? Or how has everyone else do this. Restuarant portions are so big and I usually can't eat it all. 
After years of weight struggles I've finally joined WW! Today is day 2 and I'm feeling confident! The only struggle I have is that I am also Gluten free and Minimal Dairy! But so far so good! Any advice/tips would be great!!! :)
I like popcorn but need suggestions on what to do with it other than plain ole microwaved bags. Any suggestions?
what do you suggest...meetings or online? I am just starting and need to loose like 30 pounds from baby number 3?
I find that meetings are not very motivating but just a waist of time... Is it only me guys?????
49 pistachios for 5 pts...such a yummy snack!!
I just recently joined WW and need lunch ideas. Things that I can bring to work and eat at my desk, I am finding that I am very hungry come lunch time! Smart Ones are not cutting it :)

I just tried the Progresso chicken and dumpling soup with a PointsPlus value of 2 yesterday - it had everyone in the office hungry!

Just came back from the grocerie store....we have frozen meals ,bread, pitas ,bagel and english muffins.....thats it what a joke.....
I saw in the new weight watchers magazine that there's a new snack cake, a cinnamon cake. Has any one seen this in the grocery store. It has a points plus value of 3.
Just finished my first week of WW, lost 5 pounds! hope i can keep it up now! 
Does anyone know how to calculate points for reduced vinegar? Since it's more concentrated, much like dried fruit, I'm hard pressed to believe that it's zero points. Any thoughts?
WW Apple Pie a la Mode Yogurt is ~amazing~ 
my first week I lost 2 points. I really like the new program. I feel great!
Does anyone have any good breakfast lunch and dinner ideas. I have been on WW since the end of October and I have lost 22lbs. I just wanna try something new!
My first weigh in and I lost 1.6 lbs feeling discouraged, thought I had lost more :(...I exercise 6 days a week for 1 -1 1/2 hrs, tracked everything I ate, ate all my points each day...what more can I do to improve...or am I just being too hard on myself???
lost 4 lbs my first week weigh in was today! don't feel deprived at all! for breakfast i've had up to 6 slices deli ham (1pt)fried in non stick skillet with one or 2 slices wh wh toast (2-3pts) one wedge laughing cow cheese (1pt) and a roma tomato on the toast or brummel and brown(1pt) and all fruit. (1pt) - a huge filling breakfast to charge my day!
Tonight completed my first week back at WW and I lost 4.6 lbs, sister lost 5. something but I've had pneumonia and bronchitis and haven't made it to my points each day..in fact I've been way below so I now see that I need to make at least 29 minimum..but I feel great..
Is using the online system (etools) better than tracking everything yourself? Trying to figure out what works best for most people.
I would like to recommend the new cook book. It is great. The shepherds pie is to die for!
Just started back to Weight Watchers...Lost 8.2 pounds last night!!! I was so excited :)
I bought the new WW coffee cake snackes with 3 points. When i go to add it to the tracker, i cant find it. I even tried to look it up to buy them but i cant find it anywhere. I have been selecting other WW snackes with 3 points to substitute for now. Anyone having the same problem?
Anyone know the points for the pineapple sponge cake recipe on the new program?

Just wondering if anyone knows how to get their hands on a WW recipe from about 12 years ago that was for peach cobbler? It was very quick and simple - canned peaches in juice, and the batter was made I think with the peach juice and maybe angel food cake mix? It was absolutely delicious and very low points and I can't find it anywhere. Let me know if you come up with something! It's an awesome treat! 
OK WW friends...what am I doing wrong???? I wonder if I am eating too much fruit. I eat well...probbaly could use some more veggies and less Starbucks...but I work out at least 5 times a week. I earn about 40+ activity points. I do like my sweets and have decided I can't keep them in the house AT ALL...I have lost about 1.5 pounds my first week on the new plan. Any suggestions? 4 months from today I am getting married and i really need to lose some more just to zip my dress up about 3 inches! HELP!
Wk 1 lost -4.1 lbs. doing online Points Plus program. I'm afraid that this week will be stalled due to slight heart attack and hospital stay the past weekend. Gonna continue moving forward though. Was waiting to take off 10 lbs. to up the exercise. Will wait until I see the doc on Monday to talk about exercise.
Just started WW Online 4 days ago I get 29 pts a day and I got on the scale this morning and I lost 4lbs can that be right?? I weighed myself like 4 times....... I munch all day and I feel full love the online program!!!!!
I just joined this week and tonight I am off to Chili's any suggestions?

New back to the program and made a big mistake...On the way to a basketball game for son and pulled into Taco Bell. Got an old standby without checking points value....burrito supreme...11 POINTS....BUMMER!! Lesson learned...now I know what I can do there without killing my points. Oh well new day today....Lost 2 more pounds on my 2nd week..happy with that.
Hello Everyone! Wow Your weight loss accomplishments are such an inspiration!!! I am down 23 lbs and about halfway through my journey I hit a plateau. Then just like God always does, he sent me shakeology right when I needed it! It is a meal replacement shake that is unlike anything you have ever heard of! I have now made it my goal to expose it to as many people as I can because this product has changed my life! I would love for you to add me on facebook so we can chat and get to know each other more! You all ROCK!
I need to get more veggies in my day...any recommendations??? I liked raw better and usually have grape tomatoes, carrots, and cucumbers in my lunch...but that's about ALL I get:( HELP!
yep- I totally bought a new outfit to get my butt to the gym this new year! But, I look cute and feel good... now to just get it looking good on me... Working on that! : ) 
Doe anyone know why in the new WW Point Plus food book a jigger of vodka is 4 pts. but a vodka gimlet is 1? Does that make sense? A vodka gimlet, BTW, is vodka and lime juice. 
Motivational idea: visualize your weight loss by letting a symbol (like a scale) represent each pound that you want to lose. Print out a page with, let's 20 scales, meaning u want to lose 20 pounds. Every time u lose a pound, cross a scale off until you get to your goal. I just printed mine out and put it on the fridge as a reminder to stay focused =)
If I wear specific workout clothes, then I have a tendency to work harder than when I wear clothes that I lounge around the house in. Those clothes = being lazy in my mind (but that's just me ;-) ).
Hi everyone. I am a newbie to WW. How do I track the weekly points plus allowance. For example if something that I eat is 9 points, do I just check off the number 9 on the tracker? Does that mean that I have 40 more weekly points plus left? Thanks in advance. I'm so excited that I found this page.
Scored a bunch of weight watchers dessert bars on sale to humor my sweet tooth!
Finally found the elusive 4 point pasta!!!! Bionature organic whole wheat pasta, NI is 1.5g fat/35g carb/7g protein/6g fiber. I don't know if it's a national brand, but I found it in Stop & Shop. I haven't tried it yet, just bought it today, but had to share!
Another great find today: Trader Joe's Quinoa....4 pts per serviing. It's a great stand-in for rice. We're having it tonight mixed in with the turkey chili I made yesterday.
Hi Everyone! I absolutely love this site - but can someone tell me what happened to the main WeightWatchers site??? It just disappeared!.. I was so loving it and now I can't seem to find it anywhere.
Hello everyone! I just joined weight watchers online today! Any suggestions, tips, or advice?! 
Making Unfried Pork Chops for dinner, it was a WW recipe for Unfried Chicken but since I liked it so much decided to put it on pork chops this time.
Still trying to get used to the new Points Plus. Where do DELI meats and cheese fall? power food or no?

Dpes anyone know how many pts chicken francase is on the new program?
Tried the recipe for Fried Rice in the Getting Started book tonight. It was de-lish. Better than any Chinese food I've ever had.
Can any one tell me how many points a fried egg is in fry light 
i'm in a lunch rut...any new, quick, and easy ideas for lunch? by the time i drop my 3rd graders off in the lunch room and get back to my room i have about 15 minutes!
Looking forward to getting off the yo-yo diet. Lost weight before and kept it off for several years. Never did learn to plan my diet...just buy the product. Can't decide between attending meetings or go online and attend...
I was looking at the Subway foods to determine how many points a Turkey Sandwich would be. Confused. Do we have to add up each item that goes on the sandwich like bread, cheese, turkey, condiments and dressing? Or do we go by the listing that says Turkey sandwich with the points out beside it? Help?
don't get it:( weighed at home w/o clothes and was down 4.2:) put on my outfit to go weigh in and gained 1.4...then got to weight watchers and was up another 1.4! How in the world did i gain 3.8 in the matter of 10 minutes??? I know my scale at home has always been 1 pound less...but this is odd!
Can anyone tell my why Barilla Whole Wheat Linguine and Whole Wheat Shells are listed as 0 pts online? Can that be right????
Really excited to be on the new Weight Watchers. I'm doing it online. Only a few days and already down 6 pounds. I'm getting married in 8 months. Really wishing I would have started months ago so I could have reached my goal, but I'm sure 8 months can have a big impact.
I am doing weight watchers on my own. My mom joined so I am just getting the info from her. Can't quite afford to join and go to meetings. I really need to lose weight. My sister is getting married in November and I am one of the bridesmaids. I don't want to be the fat one up there. My sister is going to have us look at dresses on the 24th and wants us to meet for dinner at Granite City. How do I know how to calculate the points for the item I order?
I like WW and new Points Plus, but here's why I get frustrated and often give up on losing weight. I had a trivia contest last nite. There's always candy, chips, pizza and more on hand during this 4 hr thing, so I went prepared with fruit and vegs. Ate lite during day, exercised, & tracked points carefully to make sure I could even have some baked pita chips and hummus. End result - weighed today and up 1.6 pounds! I don't expect fast, huge losses, but when I "follow the rules" seeing at least some reasonable results would sure help keep me motivated. Sign.
I joined WW online.. 1 week down and I am -4 lbs.. I know its just the first week but I am very excited. I love the food and the convenience of it with 3 kids. I can see this as more of a way of life then a diet. I did Mf and lost 80lbs and alot of that quickly went back on so Im hoping this can be a permanant fix. 
bringing a dessert to a luncheon at work for 20 people. i want to make something healthy, any suggestions?
I started the new points system last sunday and I love it - already down 5.2 lbs in my first week. Walked or rode my bike every day for at least 30 minutes and drank lots of water. It works!
an old WW brownie recipe. 1 box plain brownie mix and 1 can black beans. bake according to box instructions. YES, i tried it and you can not tell. really!!!!
There is also a brownie mix called "No Pudge Fudge" that is made using only a cup of yogurt and it is delicious. If I remember correctly, if you use 0 fat yogurt, the brownies are 0 fat.
Guys.... I would like to go out for dinner tonight and just eat as much as I like... I miss that so much!!!! I want to cry!!
No loss my first week on WW. I'm hoping it is due to the week prior I did a carb deplete week, appx. 900/day and less than 20 carbs/day, and now my body is adjusting to food. I finished the week with 59 Activity pts., my daily is set at 29 and I used an avg. of 27.9. I was concerned b/c I had no hunger pangs, the reason for not eating my daily allowance. Am I not eating enough? Trying not to get discouraged :~( I wear a BodyBugg, the deficit shows I should have had a 2-2.5lb loss. I'll make some adjustments and see what happens.
Hello all. If anyone would like to make me their friend I could use some support just put WW in request. I am starting a meeting this week again and need to do what I can to follow. My health is going downhill and I am just not feeling good anymore. Always tired and I have knee problems which are getting worse. I started a new job and have lost a few pounds and need to keep it up.
I'm a lifetime member who sneaked on 7 lbs over the past year. Went back to my first meeting last week and I think the new Points Plus program is great! I was surprised to lose 2.4 lbs the first week. Also wanted to share my favorite breakfast: Take a 100 calorie La Torilla Factory Tortilla (3 PP), spread 2T of Reduced Fat Jif (5PP), microwave for 15 seconds, then slice 1 banana (0PP) on top. Roll up and you have an awesome breakfast tortilla you can eat in the car that is really filling and worth the points. : )
Love the new pointsplus. IT is really exciting to be able to plan and know I have fruits at zero points.
I am feeling like the new point plus system is nothing more than a high protein low carb plan...disappointed!! Higher protein foods cause me to have major kidney stones.. any suggestions?
determination comes from the heart and mind-- if you are determined your heart will be fine
Hmmm what to have for tea ? LOL ! 
Just rejoined ww after having my 2nd baby. I managed to lose 65 lbs the first time around but gained nearly all of it back during pregnancy. So far I am loving the new points plus system. I think I will have a successful weigh in.
day 3 with no starbucks and feeling pretty good:) I hope that cutting this out of my diet I will see more results!
I restarted weight watchers Saturday! I'm excited about the ne program and nervous at the same time. any pointers would help. I would love to have a surpport group. I had one when I was on it 2 years ago and it helped so much I lost 89lbs then and well lets just say that life happened and I put what I wanted last on the list and I am ready to but me frist again. Does anyone live anywhere close to me I'm in Pike County Ky?
Help! I drink coffee (black) and I drink about 3 (12 oz cups) a day. I know caffeine takes away from your water intake so am I drinking enough water? I drink 160 oz of water a day. 
Annie as far as i know, that is the only place they can be found. I dont mind because I want to support WW, without our purchases, we wouldnt have the wonderful program.
I need some help with points conversion....i didn't weigh out my pasta before I cooked it. So instead of 2oz uncooked whole wheat pasta, I had 4oz cooked pasta...any ideas of points value?
All of you ladies are such an inspiration, I love reading your successes. Please keep sharing, the tips are priceless :~)
just had my first weigh in today i lost 6 pounds im well pleased
I just started the WW Points Plus program. The supermarket foods aren't exactly the same on 2 things I have picked up so far. I got the blueberry muffin, says 3 points on the box, but on the new points plus program online and on the pocket calculator it is 5 points. 
how many points on 1 slice of plain pizza?
I've hit a weightloss plateau. How do I get over this hump?
Wanted to let everyone know, I found the NEW POINTS PLUS COOKBOOK @ BJ's Wholesale Club for $19.99 and the best part was there was a certificate in the back of the cookbood for a year subscription to the WW's magazine! I just subscribed to this magazine so they put it towards next year! Can't beat that!! The Cookbook is EXCELLANT!! I am sure other stores has it also!!
I had the new Amart Ones Artisan Creations chicken marinara today for lunch...YUM...very filling, and yummy. I only do the smart ones when I am in a huge time crunch or on the run so this was a nice change and yummy lunch. 6 pts.
I am joining tonight. Crossing fingers! I really need this. I am just worried because I hate so many foods. I am the pickiest eater. My friends tell me I eat like a 2 year old. Anyone else here on WW that is picky?
Just had my 2nd weigh in today- 3.2lbs last week, 2lbs this week- total of 5.2 in 2 weeks. I love that I don't ever feel like I am depriving myself on this plan. I did celebrate today with too much Mexican food (my weakness), but I am back on track tomorrow!!
Im still leary just joined 2 weeks lost 7.5 lbs never hungry, this seems too good to be true. Really enjoying all the WW snacks...hoping the lbs keep coming off
I have not tried the new plan. Sticking to the old one cause it worked for me. I really don't understand why uping the points on everything is gonna work any better. I'm still going to eat my carbs anyway. Anybody on the new plan and liking it ALOT better... Just wondering
I love the supermarket foods ww has. Many good choices and portion control.
just joined weight watchers last night would be nice to have help with diet add me as a friend to help
With this new plan do they still lower your daily points allowed as you lose weight?? That always seemed so discouraging to me
I am two days into my 3rd week. I have lost a total of 6 lbs so far. I am hoping to lose 4 more by the end of this month. I am doing the online as I don't have the time to go to a meeting, so this will be my support. What kind of exercises is everyone doing and how many times a week. Also I am having a difficult time coming up with foods other than the frozen ones, any of the weight watchers products, fruit, grilled chicken, veggies, and salad. What are some quick and easy meal ideas??? 
I want to join WW Friday but before I do, what is it all about? You count points on foods you eat? Can you eat normal every day food? How do you know how many points are in something you eat? Ex. if I would eat a turkey sub. how do I know how many points it is worth?
I love the new Points + program. " Free Bananas " I have lost 19 lbs since the start of the new program for a total of 107 lbs. Hang in there folks it works if " U " work the plan. 
Love! Love! Love! the new points plus. I've lost 8lbs in 2wks and have the most supportive hubby and son...thanks guys! :)
So when you are counting fat is it total fat, saturated fat when you calculate?
Whoo Hoooo, lost 3.2 this week bieng good paid off. feels GREAT :) ;) ;) 
LOVIN all the motivation and support on this page!!!!!! way to go ladies and gents!!!!
I have to share a quote that has helped motivate me..... "if it is to be, it is up to me"
Great new program compared to the old program. Loving the no points on the fruit. Down 11 lbs. on my first 2 weeks of the program!!
I recently bought 2 of the point calculators, 1 for my purse and 1 for my kitchen, just purchased an IPod Touch and got the app for WW's and that also has a point calculator!! lol
I've been on one week and lost 5 pounds. Hanging in there, much more to go
I just started on Monday ... ordered the books & calculator online ... so far, so good ... working with a great group of women who are also on WW ... awesome support ... We can all do this!!
Help? We had Venison Meatloaf for dinner. What kind of points would that be? I only had 1 piece. Thanks,
JUST STARTED TODAY WANNA LOSE 2 PANT SIZES BY APRIL IS THAT POSSIBLE
Ok...day 2 of online WW....my problem today is that my mom made a pie....and I had a piece....but it was a low fat graham cracker crust, sugar free banana cream jello with bananas....i had a very small piece but I don't know how to figure out how many points!! She made it with 2% low-fat milk. Help!!!
Hey....i need some ideas...is everyone eating what they want within the points and ower foods. I find lunch and breakfast easy but once I start to make dinner wiht receipes, I am afraid that i am going over the points. Almost afraid to eat anything...I am not sure how to overcome this problem. Like tonight, my hubby made pasta with homemade meatballs and had one meatball because I cant get the points on that ..the pasta was easy...any thought would be great...anyone elsee with this problem? I am on my second week and only lost 1.5lbs the first week. I was really disapointed
Had a nice little workout with my little girls...of course, they didn't do much..lol but I burned almost 150 cal. I know its not much, but it burns off that piece of pizza I had earlier....lol.....and...I have no more pts left to eat tonight... 
ok girls, im needing a lil support--- i used 20 of my weekly points tonight at our girls night. 2 bud light and clamato..cheeseburger...and lays classic chips (lunch size bag). I recorded my points, have been GREAT and in control all week, but now have this nagging guilt feeling that when i weigh in tomorrow that its going to have impacted my hard work this week!!!! HELP! :)
I have been doing great so far on WW for the past two weeks since I started. But I am having a hard time managing my meals. I am a nurse and I work 12 hour night shifts. Are there any night shift workers out there in WW land? If so, how do you count your points? Lets say you go to work Monday at 7pm and eat lunch at 3am on Tuesday, do you count those points on Monday or Tuesday? I also need some ideas for quick snacks to take to work. I am getting sick of carrot and celery sticks. Any other suggestions?
I love the new point system on WW. I love that all fruits and veggies are free...except I am disappointed that the WW Giant Fudge Ice Cream bar that was once 1 point is now 3 points. :0(
WHY and i NOT losing weight??? I have been on WW before and lost 40lbs. This week I gave up Starbucks, added more veggies, and trust me...working out is NOT my problem. It's only Friday and I have earned 48 activity points! I have today and tomorrow at the gym before weigh in on Sunday. Maybe, I am eating too much fruit? I have some of my 49 points but not all...I do eat all of my 29 though. Please give me any suggestions!
if you are going to fall off the wagon, do so for a MOMENT and not a DAY...forgive yourself and compensate with water, a piece of fruit and a 30 min walk on the treadmill...your attitude will recover quickly too.
ugggg!!!!! i just started WW and went in for my 1st weigh in...everybody else was losing 5+ lbs...... i lost only a measly .8 of a lb!!!!!!!! so distraught!!!!! i did WW a couple of yrs ago and lost 20lbs.....(of course i gained it back)....now idk why the lbs arent coming off!
Having a hard time getting back on track with the new points system. Husband is just 2 months out of having triple bypass. It's so hard to have time for me when it's all about him right now. I have been eating heart healthy these past weeks. Just these last 2 weeks I have put weight on :( 4 last week and 2.8 this week I don't understand it. But will try to figure out what is going on. Total lost so far is 60lbs.
we had a biggest loser contest at work I lost 35lbs in 12 weeks....I had to have a hysterectomy 5 weeks ago and gained 14lbs back :( so now I'm trying to get back on the wagon I'm 4lbs down my first week just need a little support to get me going again!
File this under "have your cake and eat it too": Set your weekly start day to the day after your weigh in. This will be the day your weekly points reset to 49. Here's how it works for me: I weigh in on Saturday, but my start day is Sunday. I try and save my weeklies for Saturday night. So then when I go out to di...nner or for drinks on Saturday and use some of my weeklies, I will have already weighed in that morning, and have the rest of the week to recover before the next weigh in. This also gives me something to look forward to if I'm "good" all week and save my points.
Just joined online...Wish me luck ;)
hey it is my second day and I am new to this new points system but I was wondering if anyone has heard of a cheese called "Skinny Brit" an English reduced fat cheddar? Please let me know thanks
I live in Canada and alot of these foods are not available here yet... where in Seattle, or better yet Bellingham can I shop for these? Am headed to Washington State tomorrow.
It is a wonderful feeling to have when you clean out your closet and you throw out things that are too BIG for you!! Weight Watchers + Will Power = SUCCESS :) 
just rejoined ww and am concerned about the new points plus,I lost 20 pounds on the old system but I'm worried I won't be able to stick to the new system if its to complicated,how is everyone doing with it so far?
Good Morning everyone....Just finished my first workout since my hysterectomy...I didn't make it through the dvd but on a good note I'm stubborn so I'll do it again tomorrow!! I hope all of you are having a great start to the day!
does anyone know how many propoints there are in a Chicken Satay main course from the chinese... it is not listed in the eating out guide.
does anyone know how many points are in a slice of pecan pie? i know its a lot! 
Is there anyone out there who can help me understand the points plus values for some of the indian foods. Like Dal, vegetables, roti, etc. I just don't want to reinvent the wheel.
Just joined weight watchers again!!! I love the new point system:) 
I am confused on "Tossed Salad" if veggies are free, why is a "Tossed Salad" 1 point? Can anyone please shredd some light on this for me? Thanks!
Made the Mexican Chicken Vegetable Soup of the the Jan-Feb issue of Weight Watchers magazine last night for supper. Very Good!!!! I will make it again.
I recently purchased the new complete point-plus cookbook and un the crockpot is a pork loin with saurkrautm apples and onion with seasonings!! Smells wonderful, will let u know how it turns out!! 5 pt. plus value!!
tried the HG tip this AM and love it shredded butternut squash into a pan sprayed with pam and a little salt and pepper- yummy hash browns!!! and (0 points!!!) try it! 
The recipe in the new WW's point plus cookbook was delicious!! 5 pts plus! Pork loin with saurkraut and apples! My husband loves it!!
How many points do you count a whole bag of microwave 94 percent fat free popcorn?
Today was my 3rd weigh in. I've lost 10 lbs since Jan 1. I was hoping for 10 by Valentines Day, so I am so happy. The points plus really works!
Hi everyone! Started WW yesterday for pretty much the first time. I've dabbled in it before but I'm going full force this time. Anyone have any advice? Thank you :)
I've been doing points plus for 3 weeks now and only down 2.9! I am following it to a T, writing down EVERY bite I put in my mouth and drinking a ton of water and only one diet soda a day. Have not used even half of my 49 pts. I am getting very frustrated! Anyone feeling the same? I am going to hang in there because I want it off before I turn 50 in August but this is slower than I've ever had to deal with!
Cold winter, warm up with this spicy cider tea or add apple juice to make a cider. Enjoy! :-) http://www.thehealthydish.com/2010/11/23/mulling-spices-for-cider/
Has anyone tried the Waden Farms product salad dressing mayo ect....?
so just in two days of adding more water and protein into my intake...the scale has become my friend:) down 2lb in the past 2 days. And I am eating more as instructed by my leader. I burn 84 activity points a week and only eat my daily 29...i have started eating into my weeklys too! I can't wait to see what the scale says Sunday!
I feel like I've lost something! I will go and see Wenesday so wish me luck!
Weigh in today and lost 9 pounds total... Jumped on the treadmill and walked 3 miles, and made a new choc, peanut butter, chex cereal mix for 3 points... I'm thinking today is a very good day!!! LOl <3

first week...lost 3.6! yea me!! 100 to go lol.....ok i made home made vegetable beef soup....i am trying to figure out points (yes I am asking about points peeps). I did the recipe builder and it came out to 20 points....that cannot possibly be correct. All it was made of is beef stew meat, frozen veggies, some canned veggies and tomato sauce and stewed tomatos. Can this be right????
My goal is to get to 170 lbs. I know I can do it with weight watchers, I just have to stick to it cause right now I can't do it on my own.

Back on track after a week of falling off the wagon. I really hope to stay on track. Last night went to the gym yay, but then when to the Chinese buffet why do I do that to myself? Dang

alright is there a peanut butter out there that is not too high in points? i heard about PB2 - found it on amazon but its like 12$ for a small jar??? 
Should i try to stay away from lunchmeat? Thinking of what to pack for lunch as far as a sandwiche?

My next small goal is to lose 10 pounds by the 20th... I think if I keep walking my 3 miles everyday and staying within my points then its reachable <3~

Fruit is free - is a home made fruit salad? Just cut up fresh fruit?
http://www.pressherald.com/life/tough-cookie-takes-protest-against-trans-fats-to-stores_2011-01-26.html?searchterm=tough+cookie+takes+protest Help spread the word!! 
The coffee cakes are awesome..
Do you guys feel like it helps to blog while doing ww everyones telling me to start blogging it will help me stay focused on goal? comments?
my new fave? Frozen fruit blended with water, makes a 0 point smoothie that is so good! Gets that craving for something cold and sweet under control! Last night, strawberry, peach, banana, and mango! Give it a try!
has anyone done the zumba for wii game? if so, what do yoU think?
Ok been on ww online and starting my 3rd week, so far I've lost 8 lbs and walking at the gym 3miles a day and I feel great! Did I tell you that I eat all day long!
Has anyone found it hard in the past 2 weeks to find weight watchers bread products in the grocery store?? I went to three stores that usually have them, and they all had none!
Spicy garlic shrimp is worth 2 points, but only 3 shrimp. Can you double the shrimp eaten and if so, how many points would it be, 4?
I thought all veggies we're free but corn and sweet potatos have points - not surprised the sweet potato does but the corn...what other veggies are not free and fruit?
Just found this site. I will explore more.
Just purchased a box of chocolate caramel mini bars for 2 points and they taste great! 
Is shoveling a exercise? 
points plus really works...love all the free fruits and vegetables.
 Doesn't matter how much candy, cookies, crab dip, pigs-in-a-blanket or fruitcake you ate, or how many workouts you flaked out on. What matters is what you do NOW. Make positive changes for the future!
I just love the new program! I tell ya it really works! 
found this little ditty in a pile of desk stuff today: "the little engine could and you can too. there is nothing you can't do. just believe in yourself and you'll make it through. stick with it. stay with it. play with it. pray on it. make use of it. make do with it."
week one and I'm down 3.6 lbs!!! think it was because I was afraid of what to eat since I am still figuring out this new point system. was hoping to get a calculator but they were all sold out!! only 6 lbs from my 1st goal....
For my metabolism and food plan it's about 2 pounds a week....5 pounds off so far since I weighed (four days ago)Monday!!! Woo Hoo!!! I don't weigh again until next Monday.. The Goal WILL be reached now that i found the right combination of foods.. thanks for the inspiration and support!!!
I just started WW, are the smart one dinners healthy for us? I know they can be high in sodium be very easy for lunch at work. Any advice????
Just started WW, heading to the supermarket now. What should I buy????
This weeks focus was on Activity and getting off the sofa!! I am not at all a running/jogging type of person. I am proud to say I did a mixture of walking/jogging on the Treadmill the past two workouts!!! I'm so very proud of myself! Hoping I see some kind of result at my weigh in on Tues. If not.... That's fine I FEEL GREAT :) 
just found out that I have under active thyorid, Can I still loss weight??? need only around 10 #....so tired all the time!!
Last weekend in found a WONDERFUL breakfast bar for 3pts!! Its F-Factor and is all natural. The Banana Walnut Bar is awsome!!!
When you focus on problems, you will have more problems. When you focus on possibilities, you will have more opportunities. 
I'm having a problem with the recipe builder. I put in a recipe for applesauce. All the ingredients except 1/4 cup of sugar are 0 points but the total comes out over 50 points. It's just 9 pounds of apples, water, cinnamon and the little bit of sugar. So much for free fruit....
Where in Minneapolis can i find the WW yogurt and cheese? Does anyone know?
Letting go of binging.
One question: Why EGG NOODLES, BOILED 150gr is 3 points and EGG NOODLES, DRIED 60gr is 7 points? I don't know... it doesn't make sense to me.... Please help!! 
Quick question: I am a WW member from the UK (an American living in the UK). I'm heading back to the States next week. Does the WW in the US have its own WINE range like the UK (that can be bought in the supermarket)?
http://wine.mysupermarket.co.uk/tesco-price-comparison/White_Wine/Weight_Watchers_Fruity_White_Wine_750ml.html
weigh in tomorrow...hoping for some great results! I added more water and protein and feel fantastic this week!
I got My fitness coach for the WII. It is awesome. You put in your measurements and weight and it designs a workout program for you. It is not like WII fit and use the WII board. It is a full workout. It has helped me tone up....
It never pays to go to a birthday party~ I CAN'T say NO to cake....double workout tomorrow.. 
Just signed up for WW online. Looking forward to really getting started and seeing results. 
WI day....well, at home w/o clothes i was down 5.2, then WI clothes I was down 4.2, then WI at WW was down 2.8...I'll take the 2.8:) BUT...in my eyes, when you weigh in at home w/o clothes that is your "true" weight! So I always keep that in mind with out getting discouraged that the scale at WW is different. So, my plan for week 4...continue to add more water and protein...and stay away from sweets if at all possible;)

Does anyone know the points value for Lipton onion soup mix? I threw the box away and the nutritional information is not on the individual packages. Thanks
http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/body-fat/AN01327 This is a short article that I thought was interesting. I never knew that we lost weight through exhaling. You might find it interesting as well.
I just want to say that people who are starting this program should not feel bad if they are not able to do the quote, 'exercise' thing right off the bat. I have disabilities and mobility is an issue for me. I've been losing weight from day one on this program, and have my third weigh in on Tuesday evening. I've lost 12.8 pounds, with minimal exercise. As I get more of this weight off I hope to be more active. I work 4 days a week, and try to do small exercises and dance at home to youtube. It's fun and easy and I don't have to be so gung ho all at once or feel guilty that I can't do things that others can. You will still lose weight. I say, go at your own pace and don't worry about anyone else. Believe in yourself.
Ok I want to sign up but we are stationed in England and I don't want to do the UK part as I like other foods... My question is do I have to go to meetings or do you all think it would be better to just buy the cookbook?? I'm doing the biggest loser here on base but am having a very hard time with dinners any info is great thanks
Here I go again...or is that a true statement, given the new PointPlus. I have started so many times...come close to goal once about 3 years ago. I am back up in weight bad. So I begin again and anew. Wish me luck and dedication, I wish the same for everyone else. 
does anyone know if they are discontinuing the WeightWatcher Double Fudge freezer Cakes??? We can't find them anywhere? thanks!
For dinner tonight I made the home made macaroni and cheese in this month's WW magazine. DELICIOUS! Mac n cheese, side salad, sliced apple. Yummy!! and only 7 points!! Bonus - my family loved it!
Just started wish me luck! 
Anyone out there that wants to try a new natural sugar substitute... try Whey Low... It's fantastic and it even comes in brown sugar and powdered sugar. Try going to their website. And WW please don't remove this post when it can be helpful to so many out there!!!
Only down 2lbs in 4 weeks, but lost 9 total inches, I'm confident the scales will catch up!! It's still a challenge to get in all my pts. each day, but I'm not giving up. I'm adding ChaLEAN Extreme to my RevAbs workout routine, have to be ship-shape for a May cruise and "Muscle burns fat"!! What's your favorite workout/activity?
So today was my weigh in, and low and behold I lost 2 more pounds this week!!!! That is a total of 12 pds lost in one month and I've reached my first goal, of losing 5%!!!! Pushing forward and setting my sights on my next goal!!! which is losing 8 more pounds by the end of the month.. Making that a goal of 10%!!!!! Cross your fingers everyone!!! LOL<3
Can someone tell me the better power foods and maybe just spell out a daily menu they follow having a little trouble following!!
Can anyone tell me how they get in their points when they don't want to eat. I feel sick just thinking about food. 
If only I could get over this weight loss plateau...........any ideas fellow WWs??
I was having a hard time verbalizing what I wanted to know in my other comment but I think the following will make sense: I've never done the online program. Long ago I went to meetings and I want to start WW again. I see that if I do the monthly pass for meetings then I can get the e-tools for free (reg 12.95/mth). ...But the monthly meetings are still twice the price as joining online. So I want to know if the e-tools is a part of the online program or if you have to pay another $12.95 to get access to them when joining the online program... 
Does anyone know what happened to the Smart Ones sausage calzones? I used to eat them all the time and now I can not find them in any store!
i want to make a butternut squash like french fries there is an actual recipe just for squash salt and spray it comes out to 4 pts ! i thought squash was 0?
I absolutely LOVE the new WW coffee cake. That's three points well spent in my opinion. Yum! Yum! 
Spicy Honey Glazed Pork Tenderloin, with Rosemary Garlic Mashed Potatoes & Roasted Broccoli. Nom!
Hot and Yummy White Chicken Chili for a cold winter's night
Date and Nut Bread
Pasta with Hearty Italian Meat Sauce (Sunday Gravy) ...thank you for helping me give my honey a awesome birthday dinner!
And for his birthday cake... Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting! Everything was amazing! :)
ginger cream scones from Baking Illustrated served with our daughter's homemade kiwi almond conserve
onions after first hour in the oven!
onions after another hour and a half in the oven
onions after all the deglazings!!!
the bowls i have arent broiler proof so i had to melt it with a little torch and i didnt get the browning and it just looks pale and sickly...im not proud of this picture but the soup came out AMAZING (i lied im posting 5 pics!)
Your show is the cooking show that I credit with getting my husband into the kitchen and cooking. He always said that cooking was like science and it should be exact with predictable results and the product should turn out the same every time. He did not like most cooking shows on TV. One day he happened to come into the room while I was watching your show. Adam was talking about testing something in the test kitchen. My husband was hooked on your show from that moment on. Since then he has acquired his very own cookbook, measuring spoons and cups and apron. Among other things, he makes your Blueberry Buckle and Skillet Apple Pie. It took over 35 years but he got there! Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
ATK is just the best....the no nonsense cooking show
now that dishwashing liquids can' use phosphorus, my glass and plastics are cloudy. what's the best way to avoid this? anything i can add?
My resolution for this year is to find some more interesting recipes for jams to make that would blow the socks off the Smuckers people!
My resolution is to begin to learn to bake bread. I've always been too intimidated to do anything more complex than pizza dough!
My job is overnights, eating "lunch" around 1:30 am. For my resolution, I am going to figure out how to make healthier choices that I can make in advance for ONE, are less time consuming to prepare, and gear themselves for this fast paced physical job that I do.
My resolution is to bake bread at least every other week.
The last 10 to 15 years have been filled with processed meals. My new years resolution started a few months ago. I started watching America's test kitchen, it has motivated me to do the majority of my cooking from scratch. When my kids came home for the holidays they all complimented me on my meals, its a great motivation. I now have a love of cooking good healthy food. Thanks America's Test Kitchen!
This year I want to make one new recipe a week. Challenging myself in the kitchen always makes me happy (and usually makes the people around me happy too!) and between the endless recommendations from friends and stacks of magazines and cookbooks I have, this should be an easy one!
I plan to continue to create low to no-fat amazing vegetarian and vegan recipes and use as many locally grown and/or organic products possible. I also would like to compile all of these recipes into a cookbook and self-publish this year - many folks have been encouraging me to do this - especially those with whom I've shared some of this healthy veggie goodness! 
I am going to try and incorporate more greens in my diet...not just lettuce---but the kales, collards and bokchoys!
My cooking-related New Year's resolution is to find more gluten free, casein (dairy) free, soy free meals that our family can eat together, to accommodate my daughter w/ food sensitiviites (who happens to have an autism diagnosis). Cooking one meal for everyone is so much easier than cooking one special-diet meal and another for the rest of the family.
My New Year's cooking goals (or resolutions if you like) is to introduce my family to new meals by incorporating at least one new recipe a week and to take my meal planning and cooking aspirations to new hieghts! I want to use recipes from an America's test kitchen episode or from the many ATK books I can check out at my local library! Or even from a cooksillustrated.com one years membership! Right now I'm cooking an easy meat sauce from the last episode of ATK that I watched! Delicious! 
In the spirit of sharing mess-ups, I made the almost no knead rye bread (I didn't have carraway seeds)... and instead of adding a mild flavored beer like...oh...Amstel... I added BLUEBERRY ALE. Rye bread + blueberry ale. Wow. It's interesting. Edible. Odd.
My cooking resolution is to cook with excellence. I will try not to rush and just make do. I will also try new ingredients in 2011. 
My cooking resolution for 2011 will be to plan meals that can be ready when I get home from work (because I never feel like cooking when I get home); to actually get in the kitchen and cook (rather than warming up or eating out), and to get back to not eating the 'whites' (that is, white flour, white rice, white potato, white bread, etc.). Surely with three, I can manage to accomplish one!
My resolution: to buy Jack Bishop's Italian Vegetarian cookbook and move away from meats to a more "less-meatatarian" diet. (With apologies to Mark Bittman, although I don't know if he coined the phrase). 
Is there a recipe for bread that can be made after work for dinner that evening? I don't mind starting it a day (or more) in advance, but I would love a recipe that doesn't require several steps to be completed at intervals over a few hours right before cooking - I need something that could sit all day and then get thrown in the oven for dinner. Preferably with a timeline that comes along with it to help me. Thanks!
How do you know you like ATK too much? You dream of No Knead Bread all night. Actually, I dreamed of failing doughs all night. I had three going at once. Mass hysteria. That's what I get for reading the Holiday Baking issue before bed... the article on sourdough.
Just got my Healthy family Cookbook and I am soooo excited to start trying it out!!
What is editors Choice Cookbook Collectors? I cant get a recipe cause I don't belong to it. I thought if I was a CI member I had access to all of the recipes? I tried to get the "skillet peach cobbler recipe" and was not able to.
What's the difference between Apple Cider and Apple Juice?
Where can I get nutritional information for your recipes?
I've watched your show for years and love it. I recently became an online member. I found an amazing recipe that I'd like to make but it will have to be made at a later date. I looked to see if I could save it to my profile but didn't see where/if I could. Therefore, it would be wonderful if you had a "My Favorite Recipes" button on your site so that members could save their best-loved dishes from recipes on your site.
I am going to make the chicken pot pie for dinner tomorrow. Why can I not use half-n-half for the topping? I hate to run out and pick up heavy cream, only to throw the rest out...
Great pot pie
My massive book arrived. I have been a long time fan of the show and magazine. The book "Complete America's Test Kitchen 2001-2011" surpasses my best expectations. Bravo. Absolutely brilliant. Gotta run, switching pages to look at more of your books. I am humbled by the work of the entire staff. 
For the Chicago-Style Pizza recipe. Are there any modifications that I need to do if I want to freeze it? It takes over 2 hours to make and sometimes that won't fly on Saturday night. This would be great for the make ahead recipe book. 
ATK 10th Anniversary Receipe cookbook is the BEST purchase I have ever made for the kitchen. We haven't had a receipe not turn out as expected. I also signed up for the online receipes, and noticed that the online versions of the same cookbook receipies are "tweaked" and sometimes use slightly different measurements. Not sure why.
I watched the new SHOWTIME series Shameless and noticed the neighbor was watching America's Test Kitchen while she was cooking. Nice! :)
Made the Hot & Sour Soup from the 10th Anniversary Cookbook tonight. It was awesome! Just love the cookbook. I love learning about the details added to each recipe. Thank you!
Sometime during the fall I watched them fix a turkey using slices of salt pork all over the turkey. Let me tell that I've sinced fixed two turkeys like that and I doubt I'll ever stop! Everyone raves about how tender and moist it is. In fact, the white meat is even moist!
This weekend I made the Hearty White Bean Soup. Unfortunately, my beans broke open? What did I do wrong?
I am a HUGE fan of the show, magazines, books etc. Recently I found out I have a dairy allergy. Does anyone have an suggestions for ATK recipies that don't use butter or milk?
I made the Chicken Pot Pie with Savory Crumble Topping for dinner. Wow. I think the next time I'm craving a savory snack, I'm going to make up a batch of the crumble and bake it to a crisp instead of making popcorn. That's how freaking good it is. I totally understand why Chris ate so much of it on the show...
Help! Been married 20 years this coming June and am using the same cookware that we received as a wedding gift. Really nothing wrong with it other than some of the lids have lost their handles. Can anyone suggest a "reasonably priced" cookware brand? 
Hi, could someone please give me the correct WEIGHT for a stick of butter. Being in France, butter comes in 250gm or 500gm packets. I love the TEST KITCHEN BOOKS have several, found them thanks to a very good American Friend. She gets them also. As we don't live in the same country now, swapping would take too long and cost too much in postage, so I have my own. Keep up the good work.
I watched last week's show revealing the best burger and fries. I pride myself on great bbq burgers, but wanted to try it their way. Gotta say it was a truly great cheeseburger. I will try the fries when i can convince myself it's worth the calories, but they also look delicious.
just made your spice cake w/cream cheese frosting. Wow.
Made Skillet Chicken Parmesan for dinner tonight. My heavens, that was just excellent! Thanks so much for giving us this recipe! I'll be making this again and again and agin.
Has there been any recent testing on the digital candy thermometers? 2006 appears to be the last date that there were any reviews. I need help in selecting an accurate one.
Is there a more updated equipment testing of waffle irons than the one where the VillaWare V2002 Uno Belgian Waffle Maker won? The only waffle irons that VillaWare makes any more have reversible plates, and those concern me.
It wasn't the prettiest blueberry pie, but it sure was a hit when I brought it in to work today!
Watching Season Eight Video about Double-Corn Bread and then went to look it up in the Complete America's Test Kitchen 2001-2010 and notice the recipe is not included or at least not in the index. Is it missing?
Made the meat loaf the other day and everyone in the family loved it. Great job test kitchen.
I just get sick of cleaning the kitchen every time I cook, yet I love my cooking I just hate to clean up after myself. Now that would be a great group or theme for a cooking program. How to cook without a messing clean up. I love cooking programs but I bet the cooks are not doing the dishes after the show.
is anyone else having trouble logging into the website?
i live in south texas...and we have butcher shops EVERYWHERE. i have asked 4 different butchers for sirloin steak tips or flap meat. they look at me like I'm an idiot!! and they always end up just selling me sirloin steaks. i can tell they aren't the same thing. from yalls pictures and videos it looks A LOT like what we call skirt steak. well my question is, are there other names for this cut of meat depending on what part of the country you are in?
love the ATK's Guiness Beef Stew recipe! Highly recommend!
Made the Texas Sheet Cake from the latest Cook's Country episode. If you LOVE chocolate it is great. I woke up in the middle of the night to sneak downstairs for a little piece!
I just made the beef stroganoff from the 2001-2011 cookbook and it was delicious, the brandy really tied it together and I used Delmonico steaks instead of the sirloin tips, still came out great.
Help! America needs an easy-to-make white cake frosting that can be colored and used for piping flowers/decorations. I just can't make another cake with that nasty shortening and powdered sugar stuff. All butter recipes taste great, but the butter melts and the frosting becomes too runny for decorations in the midst of decorating. Is there a "secret ingredient" that could make an all-butter version wonderful for eating and piping?
Waiting for the crock pot beef stew to finish. Using your recipe. Smells good cooking.
Just put the Classic Pot Roast in the oven and it already smells terrific :D
Just wanted to say that I tried the Triple-Chocolate Mousse Cake and the Stuffed Beef Tenderloin for my birthday dinner for about 14 people, and it was an amazing hit w/ everyone. Thanks again ATK! So far I'm still 100% happy w/ everything I try.
I'm watching the episode that includes angel food cakes. As the trials were introduced I was immediately taken back to my childhood. We moved when I was 6, from Iowa, elevation 575-950 ft to Colorado at 5224 feet above sea level. My Mother did cake decorating as a pretty busy hobby, to her teaching career. She adapted all her scratch cake recipes pretty quickly to the altitude. Angel food took a while. A a kid, there was nothing better than hearing a couple muffled words that weren't in her usual vocabulary, followed by her coming in by the TV to rest, before repeating. She had another angel food failure!! That meant it was time to go grab a glass of milk, a large chunk of warm, albeit fallen, angel food, wad it up and CHOW DOWN. It seems like it took two or more years to resolve. I still don't like frosting on my angel food, some 50 years later!!!
do you guys use statistically designed experiments to come up with an "optimal" recipe, or is it more trial and error? just curious, as a professional statistician with an amateur interest in cooking. thanks!
i bought the baking illustrated cookbook on a whim one day in the bookstore and it got me hooked on test kitchen. makes me feel like a great cook and inspired an interest in cooking..i love how you educate and explain things too. thank you!!!
Made the Better than the box pancake mix last night. I did not have a griddle so I had some trouble with pan temp. They looked awful, but the family said they tasted great. Any tips for people who do not have a griddle? 
I would like to get the recipe for skillet apple pie and every time I get in I get a prompt to sign up for a magazine - I am already a subscriber and a web member - what do I do now???
A recipe for wheat tortillas would be fantastic. I tried substituting part of the AP flour in the flour tortilla recipe with whole wheat and basically got crackers.
I would love a recipe for potato and sauerkraut Pierogis! My mom never had measurements it was this and that and I still can't get it right. A recipe would be great!
Some sort of problem with your website - recipes don't show ingredients or directions. At least, that's true for the Grilled Tuna with Soy-Ginger Viniagrette.
I made the Light and Fluffy pancakes this morning. Yup, they were light and fluffy, and so delicious. Hubby was sad that I didn't make more. No more box mix pancakes for us.
Hey guys! I'm trying to log in to the website and it's down! Didn't realize how dependent I am.....starting to get the shakes/tremors.....
Made Deep-Dish Cheese Pizza for 1/2 time, potato in the dough make all the difference. Yumm- Yummm. Doesn't make the pain go away however, Bears Fan:((
HURRAY website is working & I got my recipe for best coconut cake for a friends birthday this week! THANK YOU!
I have to say, I bought the Inglehoffer mustard the other day.....Chris, sadly, I have to agree with Jack. Inglehoffer is aweful, true blue mustard lovers stick with Dijon.
For Julia: I have used ATK's chewy chocolate chip with corn syrup. I saw on PBS- ATK episode about chewing chocolate chip recipe that you stir the wet ing. 3 times before adding the dry with a non corn syrup recipe. What is the difference between the two? Also the first one used a mixer and the second one did not. Also which one would make a better " cookie cake"? 
@Julia -- I must confess that I love Rice-a-roni. I would like to create a homemade version that tastes even better. Any advice?
I was surprised to run across a reference to a new ATK cookbook coming out called Slow Cooker Revolution at Amazon. Usually we hear about upcoming cookbooks in CI newsletters, and this one was news to me. The details say 300+ pages, 200 recipes, paperpack--ugh! please tell me THAT part is not true! I am always looking for good and unique slow cooker recipes, but I already own 9 CI/ATK/CC cookbooks, so I'm concerned about recipe redundancy. Is the new book going to be all new material? Any preview info you can share?
We really enjoy your show. But when are you going to demonstrate some Diabetic recipes...Most of your sweet-tooth recipes are loaded with sugar. When I try and substitute sugar with diabetic type sugars they turn out terrible. Thanks for hearing me out...A series of this type of recipes would be very helpful to us, Diabetics.
I listened to the third radio show-the one about olive oil. They also talked about Chris's love of the Grateful Dead... I have a question. Does Chris Kimble have a deadhead sticker on his cadillac? ;-)
Hi out there! so here's my problem...ATK did a taste test on dutch-processed cocoa and the runner-up was the hershey's european d-p cocoa. well, they stopped making it and replaced it with a hybrid of d-p and natural. i can't figure out how to contact ATK and ask them directly if the hybrid is just as good. anyone know? i want to buy d-p cocoa in bulk, but not before i find out if this is the brand i should go with! please drop me a line on my facebook! thanks so much!
I live at an elevation of 8500 feet. Needless to say, baking gets interesting. Is there some sort of a rule of thumb to use? Am I stuck using ONLY High Altitude Hungarian flour? I would LOVE to be able to use bread flour, cake flour, etc.! HELP! 
I have a question for the Blueberry Pie. I have tapioca starch, instead of the instant tapioca in the recipe. Should I substitute equal amounts?? More/less? Thank you, ATK!!
I'm a huge fan! I have a question... I love avocados. I've always known that an avocado will start to change color once you slice it open and by adding lemon juice this will slow the process. Is there another way? Truthfully I don't like tasting "lemon flavored avocado" unless I'm making guacamole. It's too acidic and changes the flavor of the meal. It's like being asked to sprinkle cayenne pepper on my pineapple so it will last longer. Or workplace cafeteria literally baptizes their avocados in lemon juice. There has to be a better way to preserve the avocados delicious flavor. Any suggestions?
Tried the baked fish - excellent and the ATK's french fries - also excellent but both a lot of work. Not for a regular weeknight. Takes a lot of time but well worth it. 
ATK's recipes that require alcohol (e.g., almost no-knead bread, pie crust) have me stumped. As a non-drinker, I have no idea whether I should keep the rest of that can of beer or bottle of vodka for days, weeks, or years and use it up in another recipe later. How long does an opened alcoholic beverage last?
With all the talent you all have it probably takes only one take. LOL!
My step daughter has an IPhone and she showed me the ATK App last weeked. OH. MY. GOSH! I was frothing at the mouth. I want it! I must have it! Oh, wait! I have a Blackberry! Will you be coming out with a BB APP version anytime soon? PLEEEEASE??? Heck, I would even pay for this app!
In today's ATK email, you share a recipe for black pepper and bacon drop biscuits, which sounds delicious. The notes say that "If buttermilk isn't available, powdered buttermilk added according to package instructions or clabbered milk can be used instead." You also note: "When you stir slightly cooled melted butter into cold buttermilk, the butter will clump." It will never clump when added to water, which is how the powdered buttermilk works... I'm confused -- help!
Here's a question: I get fresh eggs from a lady down the street. They taste wonderful - very different from store-bought ones. I also find that they bake very differently. Is this true or just my imagination? I used them in your recipe for Cream Cheese Brownies yesterday and they puffed up a lot while baking and came out very cake-y, quite unlike other recipes I've tried before. They were good, just a different texture, which led me to wonder about the eggs!
Is there anywhere I can find the nutritional values and calories in the recipes?
I am wondering if anyone has ever heard of adding a small amount of almond flavoring to any chocolate recipe to enhance chocolate flavor. The amount of flavoring must be just below the level of perception of almond flavor to work. Usually this is about 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. to a full recipe of cake, frosting or fudge. David Berkshire
The Ultimate chocolate Cupcakes with Gnache filling recipe is messed up. In ingredients, it lists 2 oz chocolate and 3 oz chocolate, but it doesn't say which is for the cupcakes and which is for the gnache. Any help?
I just got to watch Fannie's Last Supper on KQED here in San Francisco. What a fascinating undertaking! Thanks so much for bringing us viewers along on such an amazing culinary adventure.
the ultimate chocolate cupcakes with the ganache filling are GREAT! Can I double or triple the recipe for the cupcakes and the icing?
I am a huge fan of your books, and I can't find any recipes for marzipan. I have been searching for something that tastes like Neideregger's that I can make at home...P.S. thanks for everything ;-)
HELP. I was planning on cooking america's test kitchen recipe for chicken teriyaki. When I checked, I have two recipes for it: I have one that calls for cooking the chicken on top of the stove and one for cooking the chicken in the oven (broiler). Which is most recent? Best?
I have been following This Old House on my local PBS. When you showed up to give some pointers, I 100% agreed with everything you said. Too bad the owners didnt listen to your ideas. You were correct everytime on each of your appearances! 
HELP! I made the Dark Chocolate Cupcakes out of the ATK Family Cookbook...and each cupcake fell in the center. I tried the rotation in the oven and without the rotation. Both times the cupcakes fell. They taste great and are incredibly moist. Could it be my oven is too cold at 350 and I should try baking them at 375? 
I really love the chili recipe in the lastest issue of cooks illustrated, it's the first time I've actually liked beans in a chili (of course my mom's response was to complain the the meat wasn't ground, but there's no accounting for some people). Good work :) 
I made ATK simple carrot cake and it was a hit! It was moist and so yummy. I followed the instructions step by step and realized that a little work paid off. Thank you ATK!
I just viewed the video called "What is America's Test Kitchen." I have been watching the TV show for years. I like the cooks and testers at America's Test Kitchen, I even like Chris. However, I find a basic flaw in their "mission." They say they are making the most dependable recipes and they are putting out some good recipes. However what they seem to fail to take into account is the basic fact that ingredients will vary. The experience and skill of the cook at home will vary. The taste of the home cook and their families will vary. You cannot account for all such factors. What you can do more of is to educate and encourage the home cook to use thier own judgment. Cooking is more art than science. There is way too much (mee dee oak-er) food being made out there and called good because so many people don't know how to use their own judgement to make it better. This includes so many recipes being made by America's Test Kitchen.
I'm making your German Chocolate Cake for my dad's 60th birthday (tomorrow). I made the filling last night, and can't wait to bake the cake today and put it all together!
I made the Pork Tinga for tostadas last night. Great recipe!!
When a recipe calls for a can of cream if mushroom/chicken, how do you replace that with the real thing. Some of those recipes sound great, but when I see that I think "no way." Of course I know that would never come from ATK.
How should I alter an ATK bread recipe when I want to double it? We love the sprouted grains bread from the Healthy ATK cookbook. Our family can eat one loaf in 2 days and I just don't have time to bake bread every other day. 
I love your show!!!!!! I am going to try the no stir polenta recipe!! I can't wait!!! Wish me luck!! :)
Currently letting my ATK Lighter Chicken and Dumplings simmer. I LOVE your show! Can't wait to get my cookbook in the mail! 
Used your recipe for the tacos today to do my meat for nachos. They were the best nachos I've made, EVER (and that's to say for the past 35 years!) THANKS!!
I made the St Louis Style Pizza (with sausage onion and green pepper) for supper. My hubby loved it so much he gave me a big smooch and then helped me with the dishes! Thanks ATK!! 
im wondering where the printed version of the swiss meringue buttercream recipe is from the recent episode "Chewy Brownies and Chocolate Cupcakes" its in the video but not in print with the rest of the cupcake recipe! 
Thank you for sharing photos of your America's Test Kitchen dishes. Please keep them coming! This week's featured photo is Crumb Cake by Peter G. 
We love both, but if you had to choose, which is your favorite: pie or cake?

Skillet apple pie, this pie is the best! The compliments I receive for making this far outweigh the effort that goes into it. Thanks ATK.
Absolutely scrumptious Chicken Pot Pie!
I made your Best Coconut Cake for a dear friends birthday. It came out perfect & it LOOKS terrific. I can't wait to taste it. I had to leave the coconut untoasted, as he doesn't like toasted coconut, but loves it plain.

The Garlic Knots from the Jan. issue of Cook's Country... these were AMAZING! Paired them with ATK baked ziti, perfect combination.

Skillet Peach Cobbler... By far the best cobbler I have ever made! And the recipe was so simple and easy! :)
I just made Cooks Illustrated Split Pea and Ham Soup (Jan/Feb 2011) and, as I find with every recipe I make, it is delicious. I actually never cared much for split pea soup, but this is so flavorful with the onion, garlic, ham and bacon, that, as my husband says of good dishes, ..."it's a keeper".
First recipe tried from Best of ATK 2011: Black Bean Burgers. Yum.
These blueberry scones turned out amazing! Everyone at work thought I bought them at an expensive bakery. I've made them again and again.
Chicken picatta w/ ultimate roasted potatoes...didn't have any parsley on hand so substituted with rosemary...a fresh and tangy favorite!!
Never going back to boxed blueberry muffin mix! Awesome blueberry muffin recipe from my new favorite cookbook.
Indoor Clambake!
Almost no-knead bread. The house smells soooo good when I make this. Next loaf I will add rosemary and brie.
Chicken and Dumplings!
Almost no-knead bread

Hey Sam! Tristan is in the middle of making your famous fish stick tacos tonight! We'll let you know how they turn out!
dear lady on the plane last night - it was great hearing all about your career, your brother in hawaii, how cool it is you work with your sister (even though you can't use her nickname at work) and that it's great you all have family dinner sunday nights. but you were in another row not even talking to me. there's this thing called an 'inside' voice...I'd check into it.
I frequently prepare Sam's recipes for the family, probably about every week. I've never thought about it before, but maybe I should start posting pics of my attempts on Sam's FB page. This one from last week is Sam's "Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad" plus his "Carmelized Red Onion Mashed Potatoes" as a side. It was a HUGE hit with the family! I'd be interested in seeing attempts by other fans of Sam's recipes! :-)
Tonight I prepared something of a mash-up between two of Sam's recipes: Crispy Salmon with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes, and Roasted Asparagus and Mushrooms. While I wasn't sure how well they'd go together, my family loved the combination. BTW, if you haven't tried either recipe yet, you absolutely must.. each one is so good! Thanks Sam, great stuff!
As a child in the UK I had my first exposure to Brussels sprouts. In accordance with British culinary standards of the 60s, they were boiled and then immediately plopped onto a plate. They tasted awful and as a result, I grew up HATING Brussels sprouts! Fast forward decades later to the 2000s.. wanting to eat healthier, I decided a year or so ago to try Sam's recipe, "Brussels Sprouts You'll Actually Eat" (AKA "Spicy Garlic Brussel Sprouts.") I had my doubts, but Sam said in his first book I'd "actually eat" them, so I thought "okay, I trust Sam, we'll give them a try." Wow, was I surprised! They were SO good, I made them once again for the family's dinner tonight, along with a few tenderloin steaks based on Sam's "Grilled Filet of Beef" recipe. A hit all around! :-) A pic is attached, followed by a "Sam the Cooking Guy" dessert.. all around, great stuff for dinner tonight!
And for dessert tonight, a hybrid of Sam's "Grilled Poundcake with Fresh Fruit" plus his "Mascarpone Cream." What a great combo!
dear person who just sent this email: "Do you have any idea how irritating your personality is? Why do you throw things on the floor? I want the crme brulee recipe, but you are so annoying I cant even watch. Please stop acting like you are talking to a room full of 2nd graders!" ...and after all that, you still want the recipe? really? ok, here it is: http://bit.ly/e1ogCk
I've been a little under the weather this week (i.e. I have a cold :-) but still wanted to make dessert for the family tonight, so I opted for Sam's "Fake Brulee." Have any of you tried this before? Granted, not *quite* as good as a creme brulee made from scratch, but still damned tasty and a LOT less effort! Just for fun, I varied from Sam's version somewhat: I added a layer of chocolate chips in the bottom of the ramekin (a surprise when one gets to the end!); I also used butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla; plus I used a 50-50 mix of brown and white sugar for the topping. If you haven't yet tried Sam's "Fake Brulee" then you absolutely should.. so good, but also so easy!
Ruben Len, thanks for your recommendation, I did indeed make Sam's Chimichito recipe for dinner tonight, they were soooo good! If you all haven't already made these yet, here's what you need to do.. drop ANY plans you might have for dinner tomorrow night, make these instead. They're easy to prepare and everyone in your family will be glad you did!
just wanted to show of MY skills, sam.
Happy New Year! Can't wait to try the Havarti and pesto grill cheese sandwiches. The Black Velvet-not so much.
Hi Sam! It's been a while... so happy to see you on FB! I love making your pesto & goat cheese bruschetta AND breakfast pizza! Always a hit with my clients and at home:) Hope you remember the onion the next time you cook up some mussels;) It was a blast having you cook/film in my old galley on The Leight Star! Best Wishes, Dallas
Sam, the hubby and I just watched the episode tonight where you made the chocolate fondu! So excited because hubby exclaimed - " HEY! *I* could make that!!!" Here's hoping! And the peanut butter on a spoon? MY FAV!
I don't know who's the more hilarious between Sam Zien and Guy Fieri. Those two gents make cooking and eating exciting, and they sure know what "camera presence" means. They are the two most entertaining chefs I have ever viewed (sorry, Paula Deen, but you do come in a very close third), and I gotta tell you, after seeing shows like "The Next Food Network Star," cringing and empathizing when rank amateurs completely blow it in front of a camera, total pros like Sam the Cooking Guy and Guy "Triple D" Fieri refreshingly make watching and learning a lot about food a whole lot of fun! 
Hi Sam, I can't find when you are on. OWN doesn't appear to have your show, and I can't find it on fit tv either! Help! I'm having withdraw! ( from your show not anything else LOL)
Sam, I'm in Hawaii and you used to be a part of me and my girl's regular Saturday television viewing schedule but now I can't find your show on FitTv. Have you moved to another channel? Oh, and I was watching one of your shows and I noticed that the expiration date on one of your ingredients was back in 2008 so I'm assuming that it was a re-run...or you need to rotate your refrigerator ingredients more frequently. Aloha
my hsuband says "he can dig you", because now he's getting fed all the time ! thx Sam for changing our family dinners to daily!!
Sam....where are you on FIT TV -- Oh no, don't tell me you are off of that channel. Boo Hiss! What is wrong with Discovery. We liked Fit TV just the way it was and now I see all these baby birthing programs? My life won't be the same without your reruns Sam. Bye :-(
Sorry for all the typo's on my prior post - new keyboard?
Made the cinnamon caramel pull-apart thingy for brunch yesterday... the family raved :)
I made your Chicken Enchiladas tonight and they were delicious! The whole family enjoyed them! Thank you
just wanted to say we make your food all the time! my mom buys my dad cooking utensils for him for christmas so he can "be like sam" LOL. he now has one of those plastic bottles for his oil. so he can be like you.
Why can't I comment on your post? Weird. Answer.... Napa Napa Napa Just kidding. Napa, Vegas, Hawaii
Sam, I'm trying to connect with your people to bring you back to San Diego 32nd Street NEX in February. We'd love to have you back if you're willing!
SAM!!! my folks just sent up the cookbooks, thanks so much, and lots of love from the fam up here!
My birthday today and I received one of the best gifts EVUH! My wife Joni gave me tickets for us to see "Sam the Cooking Guy LIVE" at the Joan B. Kroc Theater, including the in-person "meet & greet." Sam, it's great that you're supporting the Salvation Army Kroc Center Scholarship Fund, I feel good that we can help out with the charity and be entertained as well! Look forward to seeing you again on Friday the 18th!
Sam, my vote on your next travel show: 1) Las Vegas (because it's such a fun place and many of your So Cal fans can easily visit, I think it would make for a very entertaining show); 2) Napa (THE premiere wine production center on the West Coast, I'd be interested in the wineries you visit and comparing them with ones we've also been to); 3) Hawaii.. yes, a beautiful location, but not one many of us can visit often nor recreate your experience.. if you do go, stay away from the big island, maybe Maui instead (e.g. Kaanapali, Lahaina, places along the Road To Hana, etc.) Actually, on second thought, maybe I'll reverse my order.. I'd be interested to see you and your crew on the Road To Hana, where you stop, why you stop, what you make, etc!
Made the roasted tomato pasta today. Earth shattering, revolutionary,mind blowing all are words that come to mind. Better than any pasta sauce I have ever had. Someone call Italy Sam is re-writing the book.
OMFG....made your spicy crab wontons a couple nights ago!!!!! Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
making sticky sweet ribs and scissor salad for dinner. Thanks for the inspiration Sam.
Sam - talk to me about spring roll wrappers. I bought these wrappers that were crunchy. Not being able to read Chinese, I guessed and plopped them in water & they seemed to work just fine. Still on the hunt, I went to an Aisan grocery store and they had about 800 kinds that were the ones that needed a bath. You seemed to use some that came from the fridge that were 'foldable'. Thanks for your help - we love you in Lebanon Ohio!!
I'm not kidding...a good cup of espresso and Bread & Cie's (in San Diego) cornmeal & anise bisocotti may be the best after dinner thing to have.........everrrrrrrrrrr
This is my favorite cooking show! I have tried the spicy bbq chicken pizza..it was soo good!!! Love love this show!! :)
Sam! You were in my dreams this morning making Spaghetti-o's for Passover...that is wrong on soooo many levels!! Have a great weekend!
YOU FREAKING ROCK!!!! just sayin :)
Haven't been able to find your show on tv lately. Is it still on? If so, where can I find it? Love the show and your book "just a bunch of recipes".
I love the turkey sausage with garlic n pepper flakes n with pasta... love it love it. when I make it I have it for lunch or dinner everyday until its gone. every wk or every other wk.
What channel and date & time for Philadelphia, pa on direct tv?
Hey Sam, thought you might need a little help with the tally of your travel show quiz...Here are the results to date: 1st 2nd 3rd Napa: 29 21 14 Hawaii: 26 30 12 Vegas: 24 10 26 FYI, Ernst & Young has not audited these results, but I would say your fans want to see you everywhere! Take care, Bro
I use heirloom tomatoes *yellow is my fav* and drizzle a little balsamic glaze on top, stick it back in the oven for a minute and top with toasted pine nuts! I love the pesto and goatcheese and so does everyone I make it for! Thanks Sam!!
Just found your site & page. Can't wait to startcooking some of your delicious recipes!.
Caught the clip of your return to the KathyLee/Hoda debacle. Well done you. Reminds me why I don't care for that show to begin with. Would still liked to have seen what you were making the first go round before their squawking.
We tried the Shrimp Tacos with the Chipotle stuff...AMAZING!!!! Next will be the mango dessert tacos...
I have a lactose intolerant friend. I modified your Buffalo Chicken Pizza recipe and made my dairy free ranch dressing, used a special "butter" and a veggie cheese and it turned out amazing!
there are 4 of us in the family...everyone has their night to cook M-TH...this month i made the dinner schedule, (instead of constantly asking them to fill it out)...almost all of the dinners were from your 1st book...i'm doing the same for February, with stuff from the 2nd book, in addition to things we really liked from the 1st...cant wait to get the 3rd one...we love to grill....SAM YOU ROCK !!!! p.s.....i have a Jordan too havent made the JO-JO yet
Just made the baked risotto and tossed in some grilled asparagus and chicken - thanks for the great recipe! Dinner is saved! :)
hey sam just wanted to say great show i have a ?? Ive told friends of mine about you and they are interested inn watching you are you nation wide on tv or have web videos for your show ???
Sam, I keep seeing you use lump crab meat that isn't canned, but in some kind of container. Please tell me where I can find this!!! Thanks!
So tomorrow my wife Joni has jury duty, no telling what time she'll be home, so I offered to make dinner. I'm thinking of preparing one of Sam's recipes using a deli-roasted chicken; any favorite dishes that fans have tried and would recommend?
working on a potato chip quesadilla. it's not there quite yet...
I miss your show SO much!! When will you be bringing back your unique style & humor to the airwaves??? =-(
Dear crme brulee recipe person, How rude!! If you want a recipe, ask nicely and dont insult someone! Sam has a GREAT sense of humor and his show is the BEST!!:) Lighten up and have some fun with life. P.S. Sam, I must be a 2nd grader at the age of 52...dont change, I love you just the way you are!! 
Just made Sam's baked chicken tacos for the fourth time, family LOVES them! They are so easy!
Hi Sam, can i please have your recipe for fish tacos? and gotta say love your show. 
I'm hooked on your show, I want my family to have easy but NEW DIFFERENT foods, and your three in a row recipes ending with the fish tacos were it for me, I'm always wondering at restuarants how I could just cook these different cultural foods but make them easy because I'm no chef. PS show format, well done
Made fish stick tacos for the fourth time in a week! Crazy good and so easy it's ridiculous!!
I just wanted you to know our house has a new saying. Pulling a Sam. Ow Ow Ow I just pulled a Sam or Oooh, you just pulled a Sam didn't ya? : ) I trust I don't have to explain. Much Love and Laughter. 
15 minutes to make supper. Yep...pesto grilled cheese.
Hey...crme brulee recipe request person with the the attitude. Stop acting like a 2nd grader and ask nicely for things. What...you parents didn't teach you any manners? So there.... 
You are my favorite! Tonight I made your grilled vegetable sandwich with pesto on a fresh rosemary loaf. Amazeballs! Being pregnant, it satisfied need for both heartiness AND nutrition. A definite keeper!
Check out one of our recent reviews from a Post-Op Bariatric patient - www.bariatricrevisionary.blogspot.com/2011/01/review-p-28-high-protein-bread.html
P28!!! long time no talk, ill be needing to order some more bread woohoo
Just ordered some.....can't wait to try it!!
I have a nutrition store in GA and this looks awesome!! Shelf life? Wholesale pricing? Who should I call? Let me know. Thanks!
Is your bread available in SC?
A friend just gave me a loaf of your product and it is awesome! Do you have any retail locations in the Hollywood, CA area? I'm sure you do! Have another 18 pounds to lose and this looks like my way there!
Do you have any outlets in the Central Arizona area, Especially Phoenix. If not if I can get a couple people to gether to order 2 or 3 cases at a time what would the cost be with shipping. With this I will start eating Bread again.

Mr. Food recommends you kick off January (and the year 2011) with his Chicken and Feta Braid recipe.
January is National Soup Month - and there's no better time to enjoy a steaming hot bowl than this final week of the coldest month of the year! Whether you crave Vegetable Soup or Cheesy Broccoli, frozen and refrigerated foods can help you achieve the end product - from chopping up the frozen veggies to topping it off with melting cheese ... The possibilities to take part in this delicious celebration are endless!
Did you know this week (Jan. 9-16) is National Pizza Week? Lucky for you, the frozen food aisles offer plenty of delicious varieties, or you can even make your own using any number of frozen and refrigerated products as toppings (cheese, veggies, etc.) There's no better week to celebrate one of America's favorite foods!
For all you Turophiles out there, today's your day - National Cheese Lover's Day (Jan. 20th)! Your local grocery store is stocked with unlimited varieties in its refrigerated dairy aisles - take this "holiday," to sample a type of cheese you've never eaten before; or dare to try the smelliest cheese you can find; or stick w/ your favorite classic and enjoy. The options are endless!

Hey Adobe Systems! I've now been on hold with your "technical support" crew for 1 hour and 41 minutes (and still counting!). Within that time, I've been transferred from Tech Support to Customer Service back and forth 5 times. 5 TIMES! Shame on you for hiring people without the proper training and skill to answer a simple question.
Your tech support is terrible. I've been waiting a week and a half for someone at Adobe to tell me if they will send me a replacement disk for lightroom since the one I got for Christmas had a crack in it. Of course this disk has never been used and I have volunteered to send it back if necessary. I have also provided the serial number. Called tonight since it was past the 3-5 business days (8 to be exact) to find out that the case had never been escalated. When I asked if they could expedite this issue since it wasn't my fault no one had received the case, the guy said no, I would have to wait another 3-5 days and was not apologetic for the fact that it had never been escalated. I would really like to be able to use my Christmas present, but more importantly, I would just like for this issue to be over! 
We are pleased to announce that GEICO has signed on for a year-long partnership with Meals on Wheels!

From our Fresh Off The Press e-newsletter, we bring you this interesting article about the mammoth of the citrus family, grapefruit, and it's even larger cousin that you probably already know all about from our post a week or so ago. But did you know that both are sometimes, unhealthy? Click on to learn more...
Our meat buyers have arranged an exclusive partnership with Bear Mountain Ranch, located in the Rocky Mountains of Northwestern Colorado, to be able to provide freshly ground bison and a variety of cuts at each store for one week, while supplies last. No pesticides, herbicides, hormones, steroids or antibiotics are used on the ranch and the buffalo are raised sustainably, free-range and grass fed.
We want to see your new year's resolutions and hope to be able to help with those pertaining to living healthfully each day through diet, alternatives, vitamins, supplements, trying something new, getting creative in the kitchen and of course saving money! Please share.
Have you ever tasted a Tanka Bar? Conveniently located near the registers, you can find this smokey, savory buffalo jerky stick to snack on. Choose one with cranberry nuggets or the other with a spicy kick. (Gotta admit, the one with cranberries mixed in sounded a little strange at first, but my goodness, it was delicious!) This gluten-free snack is low fat and offers plenty of protein.
It's not even lunchtime on Monday and we're thinking about dinner for tomorrow night... because of the mouth watering article on page 39 of our current Sprouts magazine on slow cookin recipes. Think Green Chile-Chicken Posole, Tofu and Spinach in Peanut-Coconut Sauce and homemade soups to warm your soul. With just a little planning, prep and patience, dinner will be ready when you are. http://bit.ly/idt5Zu

We're crazy for coconut! Fresh coconut, dried coconut, coconut water, oil, milk, yogurt, ice cream, creamers... And now we have coconut sugar in bulk. It has a low glycemic index and is high in potassium, magnesium, zinc and iron. Plus, it's a natural source of vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and C. And while you're perusing the bins, scoop up some coconut flour; high in fiber, low in carbs and a good source of protein, too.
Just want to say THANK YOU for making Yogurt covered pretzels!! :) My 3 year old totally loves them and if he could eat them 24/7 he would. YUM!
I will be offering chair massage at two Sprouts locations today: Richardson, TX and Murphy, TX stores. Many are seeking neck and shoulder relief as a recovery strategy from Christmas. I will be at the Richardson store from 10 - 1:30 and at the Murphy store from 3 - 6. Look for the chair in the Vitamin Department. Happy New Year!
Just read that you will be opening a store in Roseville, CA this Spring. Really looking forward to it. First visited your store near Phoenix about a year ago and loved it!! Keep us posted as it gets closer to an opening date. Thanks!
did all sprouts stores stop carrying Kinnikinnick Foods brand or just the Dallas (Marsh Lane) store? - Pancake/Waffle Mix, Cake mixes....Although when the fort worth store opens up i will going there.
We just moved to Utah & I miss Sprouts! When are you coming to Utah?
Please bring back Purple Potatoes to Santa Clarita 
Hi Sprouts! I love your stores and do a pilgrimage every Wednesday. The only thing I don't like is the accessibility of your bulk bins to children (and rude adults) who dig their hands into the items to test the product (or because it "feels neat"). The thought of some man's arm hair (or worse) in my granola irks me. Will you be getting sealed bins any time soon? 
Beans. Beans. The magical legume. The more you eat 'em, the more fiber you consume. The more fiber you consume, the fuller you feel. So let's eat beans during every meal. (Uh, yeah, we made that up ourselves.) Canned beans are now available under our Sprouts label for 99 every day. Choose from Black, Red, Pinto, Great Northern, Garbanzo, Chili and Dark Red Kidney.
May I just say THANK YOU for keeping the registers open and on the rare occasion that a price check is needed, that you take care of it quickly. I shop at the 19th Ave and Northern store frequently...the clerks are kind and helpful. The store is clean and if a problem arises they take care of it quickly. Keep up the good work!
Customer Service rocked by Brian at the Sprouts store in Dallas on Forest Ln!!!! I went in last night because I'm out of Hansen's Ginger Ale and there was not any on the shelf. Brian went and looked in the back for me and when he came back out with none, he took me to three different coolers in the store and at least located 4 cans for me. He saved my life! I sure appreciate that level of customer service.
My son just moved from the Front Range in Colorado, out to Mesa, AZ and one of the first things we did was locate a Sprouts store near him!
I had a blast stocking up on your gluten free products today.
Love me some sprouts such great deals! I got ingredients to make homemade granola bars and all my fruits and veggies too!! So glad to see you carry the new flavors of Laughing Cow Cheese at my location which is Preston and Lebanon in Frisco, TX. Queso Fresco and chipotle and blue cheese! I have been looking for awhile!! 
Did you know? Sweet Onions are an excellent source of the flavonoid, quercetin, which is not only thought to protect against cataracts and heart disease, but also works as a natural antihistamine, helping to ward off pesky allergies and the contagious cold. These are best kept cool, dry and ventilated, not refrigerated. Tip: To quell onion breath (while boosting your immunity), chew a sprig of parsley or munch on an apple.
For Sprouts Checkout Clerk of the Year(even though it's only January...)I nominate Jared from the Round Rock store!! He is an amazing kid, a source of light & a true blessing to have on my huge shopping trips to Sprouts! My last trip rang in at almost $500 and Jared kept telling me how much fun he was having!! Everything was packed up tight(I live 2 1/2 hours away)and I once again left Sprouts with a smile on my face!
I would really like it if the Sprouts on Forest Ln in Dallas, could get a really big shipment of Hansen's Ginger Ale----I went last Thursday and again today and they don't have any. Both times I'm told a truck is coming tomorrow---can I get some cheese with my whine please? :) Love that Hansen's Ginger Ale!
as a vegitarian i enjoy my fruits and veggies....even more so if their fresh and not altered with growth hormones and pestacides....any chance u have some in So Cal?
My friend introduced me to Inglenook's Merlot from Chile - very good for inexpensive wine. I have looked high and low for it and now you have it, 2 liters for $10! Thank you!!
Queston for Sprouts in Austin and Round Rock. Why can I no longer find the Glutino GF English Muffins in your stores. Love these muffines and have not been able to find them for a couple of months now. No one in the stores seems to know why. Thanks 
Juat want to let you know I purchase some of your fresh never frozen, w/ no additives chicken wings for our family New Year weekend and they were the best hot wings we have ever had. My sisters and I are foodies, we enjoy good food and the wings were huge and had a great favor. My sister asked if she could keep the extra packages we didn't use because they don't have a sprouts in Arlington TX. I will NEVER buy chicken wing or any type of chicken again from any other store but Sprouts!!!!!! BTW the young man who help me in the meat dept at the sprouts in Round Rock TX was so helpful and packaged up some extra packages so we would have wings for everyone. I LOVE MY SPROUTS!!!!!!
Just looked at the weekly ad, can't wait for the Fort Worth store to open!! Thank you!!
i do not appreciate it when cashiers cram all of my fruits/vegetables to one reusable bag...because they don't want to give me another 5 cent credit for reusable bags. result = bruised fruits/vegetables. it has happened on more than one occasion....are the cashiers being told to be stingy on the 5 cent credit? between unbruised produce and 5 cents...i prefer the bag of unbruised produce. 
...Richardson TX store is still out of lots of gluten-free items in frozen foods.
Have a bit of a sweet tooth, but trying to hold back on sweets to eat healthier? If you havent already discovered this all-natural frozen snack called Fruit Pearls, you are in for a treat! They are these guilt-free tiny beads of frozen fruit smoothie and citrus pulp mixed together for a burst of flavor and texture that melts on your tongue. Choose from flavors like Banana Berry and Wild Berries and Cream or 3 dairy-free flavors: Tropical, Strawberry and Guava Mango.
So excited that Sprouts is coming to Dublin, CA. We just moved here from Dallas, and have missed Sprouts so much! The Sunnyvale store is just too far! Dublin isn't super close, but is do-able! A Livermore or Tracy addition would also be wonderful! 
Hi there! We have heard rumors for a while that there is a new Sprouts store coming to Carrollton, Texas - can you share any information on that? Where/when will it open? Thanks!
The Richardson, TX store is the best! The produce is fresh and well displayed. The staff (especially Edward) patiently answers my questions, teaches me how to pick out items (did you know there were male and female eggplants? there is a difference) and how to store fruits and veggies for max. life. Linda is my favorite cashier - professional, friendly, we now trade our favorite books! Mike and RIck are awesome. Great staff, great store, fabulous prices.
nevermind... just read it
Thank you for being a fan! 19,000 plus strong. We sure appreciate you hanging out with us on facebook and sharing your experiences, pictures, suggestions and questions. Cheers to a great week ahead.
I got a gallon of the Farmers milk, where you return the bottle. Do I just bring it back to the store next time I get some? And what is the 1.50 deposit about?
Ultimately, the obesity epidemic in the U.S. is because, as Michael Jacobson of the CSPI notes, "The big money is in processing commodities like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, not in selling the commodities themselves." Thanks for selling the commodities themselves.
I am offering chair massage and stress relief in the Vitamin Dept of two Sprouts stores today: 10am - 1:30pm at the Richardson, TX store & 3pm - 6pm at the Murphy, TX store. Shoppers are still rebounding from the holidays. I'd love to meet you there!
<3 sprouts here in Frisco, Texas... miss your organic milk though, was best price around... 
Dear Sprouts: I have a question. I shop at the Seal Beach Sprouts. I usually bring my own bags and am appreciative of the credit they earn me. I also bring in produce bags (those green, reusable ones that supposedly add refrigerator life to the produce). Sometimes cashiers give me credit, other times they don't (50/50). What is the policy on this? I sometimes have 8-10 bags, bags that most people just throw away once they arrive home. I just want to know one way or the other if I should or should not be credited for bringing and using my own produce bags. That way, I can print out your response and show it to the cashiers (assuming you agree with me) as proof. Thanks!
Was in line at 6:10ish this morning for the Fort Worth opening! Thank you for letting us in a tad early it was COLD! And the muffin and chocolate milk made for a yummy breakfast! Very impressed with the great selection at the meat counter and the veggies!
Dear Sprouts, how I covet thee. :) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE come to South Arlington, Texas. Say, to the Highlands? We have nothing in South Arlington like you. There is a Whole Foods in North Arlington but it takes 20 mintues to drive there. We like to eat healthy in South Arlington too. :)
Sprouts Dark Chocolate covered Almonds are my downfall. YUUUUMMMMM!!
How about opening a store somewhere in southern Orange County, CA... Mission Viejo or Lake Forest preferrably! 
Cannot WAIT to buy some of those dry sea scallops on sale! My absolute FAVE! Yum!
Was looking forward to Sprouts opening in Fort Worth Texas, however I was disappointed by the prices of packaged items. Most items were way over priced other stores in FW. Or it could have been the turn off when the cashier coughed and sneezed over all my items. I recommend to Sprouts to lower their prices and make sure your workers are healthy.
I've always appreciated that Sprouts is one of the few stores around whose cashiers don't bat an eye if I make a request for no bags at all. (I just take it out in my cart and transfer the items to a cooler in my car) I usually shop at the 57th Ave and Bell (Glendale AZ) and occasional the 83rd and Thunderbird (Peoria) locations. I do have a bit of a silly question though. Why is the canned music always set on oldies from the early 50's? It would be nice to shop to something more contemporary. I think most of the cashiers would agree.
Our Sprouts in CO carries the best ever bleu cheese dressing: Bobs Big Boy!
Can you tell me how your meat is raised (your store brand meat) Thanks!
Love shopping at Sprouts. Your fruits and Veggies are always the very best and I absolutely love your vitamin dept. So affordable! Thank You!
Love your store; the nitrite free lunch meet, the flowerless bread, the uncured sausage, the organic everything.....I'm in love!!
Once upon a time I found a list of the PLUs for open stock spices. I can't seem to find it anymore and now have some baggies of spices identified only by 4-digit numbers. Can someone direct me to this list? The one on the website doesn't seem to include spices. Thanks!
went to Sprouts first time easy to find everything,great prices,great employees......

We've been getting properly worked up by Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall's Fish Fight campaign on Channel4. Insanely, half the fish caught in the North Sea get discarded because of EU regulations. We're looking at the fish we use and already have a gorgeous Mackerel with Chilli Butter & Lentils dish on the blocks. Ironically, we can't find enough supply of mackerel! Maybe Hugh's campaign is already working. Sign up here:
Our friends at Aardvark have just launched their 2011 manifesto which is a splendidly spirit-lifting end to January.
Here's our new Mackerel with Braised Lentils recipe, as promised. We're currently getting a new website ready for our Remarkable Recipes competition (details to follow shortly) and want to upload a few of our own COOK recipes - any requests?
In this month's newsletter we asked for Oolong-alike photos, so if your pet has demonstrated fine balancing skills (or is willing to try new things) post them to the wall here on Facebook.

Just received a lovely email, which has put a smile on all our faces this morning: "I never ever rave about food but this was absolutely spectacular!

Its a no brainer, we will be an ongoing customer of Cook, brilliant!!" Thank you Bridget!

I LOVE your sweet potato fries and was so excited to see that you had a coupon, but when I tried to print it, it said no more prints available. Is there anywhere else online I can go to print a coupon? 
Your Sweet Potato fries are amazing, I put my fries in a bowl and sprinkled a little bit of Light Olive Oil and I made a rub of Splenda, Cinnamon, and a little bit of sea salt, and put it on the fries while hot and put a lid on the bowl and shake and every fry is coated with yumminess.

None of the new french fry choices are all that appealing. Has that occured to you guys, since all the percentages are about even? I felt like, "Pick something, because you HAVE to, now!" So I picked the Parm ?lemon Russet-but that doesn't sound all that great.
Our family misses the Onion Ring snacks!!! We ate them with everything...on hamburgers, in salads and even crunched up and used as breading for chicken!! They were wonderful!! New flavors are wonderful, but nothing will replace the Onion Ring snacks!!
Alexia Sweet potato fries are a compliment to any meal, but I like them to liven up a fish dish; read tilapia or salmon.
Luv the sweet potatoe fries fools!
Your Garlic Baguette is awesome. Very delicious. It goes great with the chili recipe that I make. 
are your frozen vegetables pre-cooked at all? specifically the red potatoes with harvest vegetables?
Tried the Sweet Potato fries and they were AWESOME!
just tried your chipotle sweet potato fries--love the spiceyness, mmmmmm
YOUR ONION RINGS R OFF THE CHAIN!! JUST WISH THEY HAD MORE RINGS PER BAG!!!
I love that our family can enjoy your food! It's hard to come by good, healthy, allergy-friendly alternatives! We're soy, wheat, peanut, and tree nut free and always have a bag of your fries on-hand!

food question, so I thought of you...trying to scale a recipe I saw somewhere. it calls for 3 number 10 size cans of a sauce then they added some spices/other things. do you know how many ounces in a number 10 can? I think it was 96, that seems to be what I find when searching, too. are all number 10 cans 96 oz?

This is the year of publication for the EXPLORER'S COOKBOOK AND TRAVEL GUIDE! More recipes and a new destination is planned - Catagena, Columbia. This was a major trading port, especially for precious metals such as gold and silver. Pirates, corsairs and privateers such as Sir Francis Drake came to this popular port to trade and pillage.
As they had only limited means for storing foods for long periods of time such as salting, smoking, and preserving with spices, they chose to experiment with the local foods from the lands they were exploring. That is what this book is all about. Continue with us and be part of the exploration and discovery. We will be serving a quick-to-make and long lasting, cheese wafers next week.
Cheese wafers were served as a dessert on special occasions. Beat four eggs in a bowl; add a pinch of salt and enough flour to make moist dough. Once mixed, roll the dough into thin sheets and cut into round bite-size pieces. Cook the wafers in a frying pan coated with oil until they are golden brown on both sides. Put a piece of cheese between two waters and heat in the frying pan until cheese is melted.
Is it cold where you live? Here is a place you may consider escaping to. . .The Bahamas have secluded beaches where swimming and diving in gin-clear waters make these islands a diver's dream. For the land lover, there is lounging on white sandy beaches; hiking and bird-watching in the national parks, and touring Potter's Cay Dock and the Straw Markets in Nassau and Freeport.
Hello Cookbookies! This book is in negotiations with the cruise industry. We are awaiting their response. The book will succeed. It is a helpful Caribbean Cookbook and Travel Guide - a momentum of your trip should you travel in the footsteps of the explorers. Thanks for your support and belief in me and my book. We are off to the Bahamas tomorrow stay tuned
Happy 2011 foodie friends! We have a New Year's resolution: To connect with more fantastic chefs across Australia & New Zealand, to bring you delicious and creative recipes and keep you inspired. Please get in touch if you're interested in getting involved. BIG Thanks also to chefs Alasdair Nicolson in Sydney and Luca Villari in Auckland for their support so far.
Here's a great simple summer salad we tried recently (to rave reviews from everyone at the party!): Simply grill some Halloumi cheese slices, add fresh Pomegranate, fresh Tomato, fresh Mint, 1-2 tbsp Sami's Kitchen Zaatar blend and some Caramelised Balsamic Vinegar. Find a nice big platter and place it all on top of each other. This should look impressive and be bursting with refreshing flavour. Enjoy!
We are looking for friendly, passionate foodies who would enjoy working with us at Sami's Kitchen tastings in stores and markets. No experience needed, just a fun spirit, good smile and an interest in food. We'd love to hear from you if you (or someone you know) are interested. Thanks!
Have you spotted or bought a Sami's Kitchen product anywhere recently? We would love to know where you've seen us lately or where your favourite place to buy a Sami's Kitchen blend is... You can just comment below or drop us a line at info@samiskitchen.com.au or info@samiskitchen.co.nz

I DID NOT eat at the restaurant in Louisiana. I carried-out from your location in Schweinfurt, Germany (which is NOT one of the selections, but IS in your locator, by the way)... The phone number for it is: 011-49-972-187-553. NOW... The reason I'm emailing is because I was there at 1530 on 1/1/2011 (today) and ordered a 6-piece chicken nugget for my daughter, along with food for myself and my husband. When I got home with the food, we all settled down to eat and my daughter said her food was cold. At first, I thought that this was because she was dipping her nuggets in sauce from our refridgerator.
Happy New Year Popeyes ! Nothing says loving like Popeyes Chicken.
im a dog and im gona steel ur strips 
mannnn i season, make, fry, serve, and best of all eat popeyes chicken everyday... no complains about that...
Is it Popeye's usual practice to get patrons to pay extra if we request for specific size or parts of chicken? Seems I have to pay more in order to change my chicken from thighs to breast in Singapore. Of all outlets, I went to the Bedok Point outlet and was surprised I have to pay extra because I want to do a swap just because the first servings she gave me small pieces of meat.

please put a popeyes chicken in sidney ,ohio...its the best chicken ever...
please reopen ur branch in Riyadh Saudi Arabia. I used 2 go there as a kid and i s0o0o miss it!! 
We used to love going to our local Popeyes. The customer service sucks! The Whitby Popeyes always has dirty tables. No one but the cook wears a hair net, gloves, or an apron. The owner was walking around on the phone with his kids running around the food area. The girl who served us didn't wear gloves, an apron or a hair net and she had long hair. It was just gross! Haven't been back since November. I wont even mention that after being served, we notice the girl rub her nose with her un gloved hands that she served food with, the twirled her hair. Thats when we threw out our lunches and have not returned. 
Love that Chicken form Popeye's!!!! 
i absolutely love popeys chicken but unfortunately the closet one to me is a hour and half away and that sucks big time i wish they would open up close to me because kfc is disgusting and popeyes rocks. especially the spicy chicken and dirty rice.
it bean day eat them beans !!!!!
Just had my first taste of popeyes....love the red beans and rice!!!!!
Just found out there is a Popeyes in Chattanooga, TN!!!! Yay!! Popeyes has the best chicken, hands-down! KFC sucks! 
POPEYES IS THE BEST I LOVE THAT CHICKEN FROM POPEYES
I love Popeyes but when are they going to update their coupons on the web-site. They are expired. I would prefer that the web-site be more user friendly, post specials and prices. 
I want to file a complaint against the Popeyes in Ft pierce fl... The chicken was so small i could pick it up with my two fingers... Not only that my red beans and rice had no type of seasoning.. The biscuit had a funny taste and the cheated me out of my fries... Now i love popeyes... But i surely wont be visiting that one ever again..
I love Popeye's chicken so much that I wan tto open a franchise! The closest one is a 3 1/2 hr drive.
i want to file against the franklin,la. popeyes i spent 17.26 for a meal we had to throw away that chicken was so dried out and burn,the coleslaw was sour and the mashed potatoes was to salty,this is the second time and they wouln't take it back..i will not go back too popeye's in franklin ever, i'd rather drive miles too church's,i know i will get fresh food..talking about they have good food ..nope
Anybody know how long it would take them to call you back after submitting an application? I applied to the one in raleigh, nc if...if that matters
When will the location in Raleigh, NC open? It was supposed to open back in November.
Complaint, Popeyes in Palmdale CA on Rancho Vista Blvd and 10th St W really sucks, this is the second time I got hard biscuits and a pile of greasy chicken and yes I got stiffed on the fries also fries that cost $1.79 for five cold ass french fries. I will NEVER go to Popeyes again.
Why did Popeye's get rid of onion rings in central Florida....that's like having a PB&J WITHOUT the Jelly!!!! Bring back the DAMN onion rings!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
thank you for tasting so good popeyes!!! I love the mashed potatoes with gravy i could eat it everyday!!! Im so happy i live less than a mile away from you!!! Keep it up!!
i LOVE popeyes chicken! THEE best fried, spicy chicken EVERRR! && the biscuits and mashed potatoes too! unfortunately...i have to wait till i visit my friends in indiana until i get the chance to savor your deliciousness b/c there are absolutely NO popeyes in my area :( :( 
i love popeyes like a fat kid love cake 
I LOVE U SO MUCHE U ARE PART OF TEH REESON I AM FAT! LOL
When is Popeye's of Raleigh, NC is going to open?
POPEYES !!!!.........why did yall stop serving chicken nuggets and your original sweet and sour sauce.....I swear it was the best its better then what u guys serve now. Please go back to the old sweet and sour sauce and chicken nuggets
Had a 3pice with red rice and beans... for lunch today.... gots to work it off now...
i wish i could take a bath in red beans n rice. seriously, i would bathe in it, then eat the red beans n rice. im serious.
This place killed my cousin! He ate their chicken everyday and received a heart attack with a case of diabetes!
When is the Raleigh NC store opening?
I can't wait to move to Virginia Beach next month so I can eat at Popeye's more often! There aren't any here where I currently live, in West Virginia.
When are you going to bring back that good chicken sandwhich you used to have? The spicey sort of one, on a nice bun, with lettuce, tomatoe, and that orangish sauce. I loved that!
I'm so ready to check out the new Popeye's in Raleigh, about time we got one lol
 Also, heard through the bullet proof glass at The Popeyes on Stoney Island, in Chicago that you have to have an order over $6 to get hot sauce. I guess that stuff is like gold on the south side. I always keep some in my car anyway. Just a reminder always hold onto that extra hot sauce cause ya never know when you're... going to need it. So if anyone form Popeye's is listening make sure that Stoney Island store is getting extra sauce there, cause it is getting dramatic there!
When are you gonna make a Popeyes in southern/central Virginia?! The only time I get to enjoy your deliciousness is when I visit my grandma like once every 3-4 months! :(
I love ur chicken but the one in my town is soo slow i get tired of waiting and leave
Why isn't the Raleigh location listed on the store locator? My fiance just told me it was open.
the fried chicken need to be even spicier than that
I wish there was one here.. you need to put one here in Nelson 7020, New Zealand ( I WANT SOME POPEYE'S CHICKEN PLSSSSSSSS )
just got our first one here!!!!
Hi Popeye's!! I want to tell you that, "I LOVE THAT CHICKEN FROM POPEYE'S, STRAIGHT DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS!!" Thank you Popeye's for serving me the best cajun chicken.
WELCOME to RALEIGH NC,Popeyes!!!
haha there's a popeyes that's only like 10 minutes from my house:)
Glad that popeyes n raleigh is finally open! but that lines r crazy. guess i'll try 2 get some another day lol
Can Popeyes start selling some Okra? Cajun people eat okra, or maybe it's a southern thang, but I would like to have some spicy fried okra, please!!!!
I agree you need spicy fried okra
Red Beans & Rice!! Yum!
welcome to greensboro, n.c. the kinks will work themselves out. yall just do what ur doin and u'll have long lines erryday!
WE 4 POPEYES IN RALEIGH THE LINES ARE TOO LONG
its funny how all the black people right on this page but we all like chicken
Popeye's Singapore-- Like how really tender and crispy your chickens are. But, coleslaw needs a little improvement though. The feedback site's input box couldn't really let us fill in enough words, very limited number of words. You may wanna fix that. The biscuit taste has changed from the last time i bought too! :P
popeyes is the best chicken n the world
' I support "POPEYES Singapore" . <3
I support " popeyes" Jordan Aqaba....
LOOOOVE your fresh brewed, unsweetened iced tea and spicy fried chicken with red beans & rice. That's living! :)
love that chicken from popeye's
Hope popeyes Singapore can open a branch in Jurong or west area.
I work for Popeyes in st.louis in i hate the fact that they treat us like they own us and that just isn't fair neither do they want to give us a raise.
i am hungry for a shrimp combo with a warm buttery biscuit.
Thank you for finally opening a Popeye's in Raleigh! Please open a few more so the line doesn't take an hour to get through!
I hate it when I go to @PopeyesChicken (because i love the spicy mashed potatoes and gravy)....and the dumb window cashier can't get the order right. I drive all the way back to work and no mashed potatoes to be seen! Of course if I drive all the way back they will fix it....no thanks, you already wasted my time today. 
Yall Biscuits is till the BEST eva!!
Just got me some and it is better than KFC or Church's
POPEYES CL UNTIL YOU GO TO RUDYS CHICKEN YA DIG
luv this stuff just had some earlier lol
I work for sailormen inc..and so yall know..u guys should really do more for ur employees..i have work for the company for over two years and never got a raise..i make crap money.. For all the work i put in..u ppl should look into treating employees better than they r..ya wonder y the turn over is soo high..if didnt have kids that i need to support ida been out the door along time ago..even after the store i was at bein shut down..and tranferd to another 2x as far still not even paid for that..fix this problem please.. 
Love that Popeye's chicken and those cajun fries are great but I must say since I moved from NY and NJ I've missed that great cajun taste; we have a kernal but we all know his chicken is terrible. There is no Popeye's chicken in the Pocono region of Pa. With so many NYers and Jersey folk moving to mountains we need to get that Louisana kitchen in our neck of the swamp. if you are from Stroudsburg to Tobyhanna and/or from Blakeslee to Bushkill Lets let Popeyes know we need our cajun fix
Dear Popeyes: please bring back wicked chicken :)
i'm soooo happy i just won a new popeyes jacket for having an awsome drive thru. that was a really good gift all the work i put in to making sure my customers get good, hot food, fast service really paid off. i really care about service because i'm a customer somewhere and i want the same service i give to my guest. 10757 really rocks!!!!
Why did you take away the spicy chicken sandwich? It was the best spicy chicken anywhere!!
just got my customer appreciation chicken today!
imma shift leader in milwaukee hey quick question are all of the popeyes slow (customer wise) right now im just wondering- is labor that high..,.
I love working at popeyes....I love their chicken wings, and macaroni.
I will steal all the chicken and pay for all of it
Popeyes chicken is THE SHIT!!!7
I <3 popeyes chicken... but I am upset that we can no longer pay extra to get white meat pieces like wings and breasts with specials.... This is happening in Hawaii and that stinks!
Just got some chicken tenders & mashed taters with gravy.....YUMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!
Just had the 3 piece fried chicken meal with mac and cheese and sweet tea... so good! 
Just had 3 pc naked tender combo
How about Lebanon,Lake Ozark,Osage Beach,Camdenton,MO and so on in MO/KS/FL?
Those biscuits are extra good!
love that jambalaya :)
Best chicken everrrrrrr, <3
they chicken better than KFC
Where Did The Jambalaya Go In FL?!?! Its been like 9 years now 
Dang it popeyes, i miss your delicious chicken =( haven't had any since i injured my foot, i'm coming back with a vengeance !!
Best chicken ever. :)
Freekin <3 popeyes. But this is the second time they have messed my order up at this popeyes off colfax and York in Denver, co.! I ordered 2, 9 piece nuggets only (cause I LOVE the nuggets with the hot sauce packets, it's all I get) and they gave me 6!! I'm trying to call them right now but they keep picking up and hanging up! UGH! I'm at work till 9 tonight and I just wanted my nuggets!
Good Chicken today at Popeye's!!!
the best chicken ever me think so!!
Best chicken in the world!!! I WANT SOME RIGHT NOW!!! Magic genie, where are you?!
We want a Popeye's on Amelia Island, Florida! <3 Love that chicken @ Popeye's!
Montgomery County, Virginia contains both Virginia Tech and Radford University. There is not a decent fried chicken place anywhere around. PLEASE consider Christiansburg, VA for a prime location.
I love chicken it is so good yummmmmmmmm it is my screen saver on my cell phone
We drive 45 minutes to get it from a truck stop close to Knoxville - please move one closer!!
Dear Popeyes, Can you please find someone else to be the face for y'all? I am proud of my LA heritage but Annie (I think that's her name) needs to go! She does NOT represent us well at all. She sounds like she just came out of her master's field. That's not how we sound/act. Is she even from LA?

Yummy Banana Burfi. Goes well with hot tea in the evening. Recipe is below: This one has to be one of the quickest and easiest indian sweet recipes (considering how difficult they are to make). This one was prepared in the evening after a local Kannada Channel (Suvarna TV) broadcast it. They called it Banana Peda, but I chose to name it Banana Peda-Burfi as the texture is between a soft peda and a hard Burfi. The sweet sticks in your mouth and as it cools, it becomes harder. So it is advisable that it is eaten as soon as it is made. Ingredients: Ripe Bananas Yellow ones with black spots variety, but into small squares 4 Ghee (clarified butter) 2 tablespoons Sugar 1/4 tablespoon Cashewnuts- 3 to 4 Method: Heat ghee in a pan. Put Bananas (cut into small squares) into the ghee and add the sugar to it. In a medium flame, keep stirring continuously till it forms a halva-like consistency (more about sugar-consistency here) After a few minutes this will thicken. Form round balls or shape like a small vada. Decorate the Peda with Cashewnuts on top. Serve as an evening snack with tea. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Read more: http://www.top-indian-recipes.com/blog/

Just got my tickets for April 30th in Palm Desert, the best seats in the house. Can't wait. See you there Jesse. 
Just got my tickets for Scottsdale in April...............can't wait to hear your amazing music again.
Terrific show in Markham tonight....thanks for the great fun.
Jesse: Your concert last night was fantastic as usual. I wish in all hearts that you could back and play at the Toronto Zoo where I first heard you. Atmosphere is phenomenal there hearing your music. It makes it sound so much more mystical.........your biggest fan.....woof
last night's show was wonderful! it was my first as a fan of over twelve years, I enjoyed every piece, and "manolo's lament" especially :) the only downer was having the great pleasure of a photograph with Mr. Cook himself, only to find out later that my camera had deleted everything :( looking forward to many future concerts!
You & your entire band were amazing at the Grand Theatre tonight. You are a phenomenal guitar player. What a unique & versatile style. You are truly inspirational & an incredible performer. Kingston was SO fortunate this evening. Hope you return to Kingston every year Jesse! We were dancing in the front row of the balcony when you asked us to Rhumba for 20 minutes! 
All I can say is "wow"....you truly amazed your audience with you impressive talents! We saw you last night at "The Grand" in Kingston. We have been listening to you for years however seeing you live was a gift. The way you connect with your audience with such charm was a delight! I wish you much success connecting with many audiences all over the world...We will absolutely be sitting front and center at your next performance.....Bravo!
Amazing performance last night in Kingston! Had such a great time watching the immense talent, diverse instruments, fast fingers, and the Rumba party was a blast :D Please come back to Kingston soon!!
Loved the concert Friday in Kingston!!!! The band was amazing - I am so glad that I had the opportunity to be there. (Spent all day today cooking to Jesse. Awesome.)
Letter from a customer in WV: "With the order I just received from you was a copy of My Bird Bud. How wonderful this story is! I knew I liked Blue Crab Bay Company--for reasons I only sensed until now. I love the Shore---and I cried when I read Bud's story."
Great fancy food show in San Francisco, introduced our new Sandbaggers Sea Salt & Cracked Pepper Nuts and they were a hit!
Thanks for all the great snacks you come out with and your customer service. We retail Blue Crab Bay in our PA gift shop and they are best sellers! Can't wait to try the Sandbaggers! Continued success in 2011!!!
If there are any headquarter persons here, I would love if you would consider a cheddars in west Tn, perhaps, Jackson TN, it is full of growth and one of the major business is eating out. I believe you will profit exponentially if you were to place a restaurant here.
we went to Cheddar's in Huntsville Al. for the very first time recently and just loved it!!! The menu has so many wonderful choices. Wish there was one in Sarasota Fl.
I love Cheddar's--it is by far my favorite restaurant, but have become disappointed lately because the menus at our local Cheddar's are not cleaned regularly. They tend to have unknown sticky liquid and today they had dirt on the edges. We spoke with a manager who said the menus were cleaned twice per day, which tells me it's either one of two things: Either 1) cleaning the menus twice a day is not enough or 2) the person in charge of cleaning the menus is epically failing at their job. This has happened at least four times in the last six weeks. I mean, I love Cheddar's--the service is second to none and the facility is clean, but this is definitely something that needs to be looked at by management. Thank you.
Cheddars come to New York!! I LOVED having it in Texas last week! :) 
Cheddar's yall need to open a store in tuscaloosa alabama!! That location would do well, plus T-town deserves a nice and awesome place to eat!!!
why doesnt Cheddar's want feedback from guests? Their website has absolutely no information about how to call Cheddar's Home office. The web site has a form to fill out and submit online, however--if the user takes longer than 30 secs to fill out all the blanks/boxes and then clicks "submit" they get an error message saying that the page "timed out". This has occured repeatedly.
is Cheddar's racist? I had lunch at the Johnson City, TN store yesterday and saw only white hosts, white servers, white managers, there was one hispanic person busing tables. The population of Johnson City is much more diverse than that.
Had a great meal at Cheddar's last night - Vegetable plate for me, as usual. Hubby loves the Salmon. But because there's no carrot cake on the dessert list, we went somewhere else and spent just as much for dessert as for our meal at Cheddar's. How about adding carrot cake to the menu? You'll get more business and save us some $$. Thanks for friendly service and good food at great prices! 
Just need to get a Cheddar in NE Ohio; preferably in and or around the east side of Akron Ohio!
 Cheddar's you need to put another restaurant right next door to the one at Valley View mall in Roanoke Va this one is to busy Thax 
Lovin' our new Cheddar's in West Monroe, La!!!!
i love cheddars!!!! just want to let u guyd know that ur staff in brownsville, texas is very very nice.. always get awesome customer service everytime i go... mmmm n yummy food n drinks :-)
When does Cheddars in Independence, MO open?
Born and raised in Kansas City, my first encounter with Cheddar's was when I was a college student in Springfield, MO. Needless to say, I am now a BIG FAN of Cheddar's! Now that I'm back in KC, there's a new location getting ready to open in Independence, MO (Off I-70 & 291)...do you know when this will open?
Galilee Baptist Church's Mass Choir is gathering @ Cheddar's in Longview, TX tonight!!!! There's nothing like good food & fellowship! ;)
im not impresses with cheddars anymore. i never plan on going back because i was told that imsuspended but was still expected for me to get my shifts covered. i felt this was a company not caring so i decided to leave and never plan to return.
In Shreveport, LA, Cheddar's has become a new favorite restaurant of mine. Just two concerns though. 1.) I know you do not take reservations, but I'm positive it would only help your business if you did! Back in December, I tried to do a Christmas get-together with some of my girlfriends, and the waiting line was two-and-a-half hours long! That is way too long Cheddar's! 2.) I usually order the grilled chicken alfredo and just ask for the vegtables to be taken off. All the times I've gone the waiters/waiteress were able to do this, except for the last time, which she said she couldn't because "it was already mixed in", and then my meal proceeded to come thirty minutes later. If you didn't have to take the vegtables out, wouldn't that make it faster? I just don't understand what's so difficult about that; it should be easier on the chefs in my opinion. That was all; thank you so much for *hopefully* reading this!!!
 In Shreveport LA, Great food, Good price, have to catch them in the off time though, will not wait in line for a long period of time for food, got there bout 4:20 and 15min ltr we were in a booth, once again great food, need to work on the waiting though !
The new location in Knoxville TN needs to be updated and added to the web site!
My family and I went to the Cheddars in Roanoke, Va on January 8th. Our very first time visiting. We had an awful experience. I went to the website and sent an email, and I haven't heard a thing from anyone. I guess they don't want our business.
we need a Cheddars in Kansas City MO!!!!
Ate at Cheddars in Baytown, TX for dinner. I liked everything EXCEPT the steak its too damn small like the back side of a Chihuahua not worth the price they charge. 
LOVE Cheddars.. always amazing food and we always need a box because we can't eat everything... and the prices are incredible. Never had a bad experience! Think I'm going tonight!
Does anyone know the open date for the Cheddars in Independence Missouri is opening.
Do NOT go to the Cheddars in Columbus, Georgia. They have taken a reservation for 10 on three different occasions, and have not had a reservation when we got there!!! Their attitude stunk, they refused to give me a phone number or address so that I could complain. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN, AND I WILL ENCOURAGE EVERYONE I KNOW TO BOYCOTT THAT RESTAURANT!!!!
I have only eaten there one time with my mom and sister and it was AwEsOmE!!!! We just got a new on in Knoxville, TN
I am happy to announce that the General Manager of Cheddar's called me this morning, and is going to extraordinary efforts to make the fiasco last night right!!! 
I worked at Cheddar's in Johnson City, TN and LOVED it!! I loved the food, I loved my co-workers, and loved they let us do a marketing project on it for our marketing class our senior year. I miss it everyday. I wish they would bring one to Woodbridge, VA :) I would still eat there everyday!!
Just ate at the Cheddar's on Morgantown, WV. What an awesome meal, great service, great price and very time efficient. Will definately go back!!!!!!
The Cheddar's in Tamarac is awesome, and Troy at the bar is the best! 
Just ate at our first Cheddar's Restaurant and it was awesome and the prices were gr8 at Cabela's Dr. Wheeling WV.
Just ate at our first Cheddar's Restaurant and it was awesome and the prices were gr8 at Cabela's Dr. Wheeling WV.
Outraged with the service at Cheddar's in S'port tonight, both from our server and the management. We waited almost an hour & a half and still no food, so we walked out. Unbelieveable! I will never go there again! 
Cheddars is Ontario, OH by far needs to get new managers. they were very rude when i for lunch today and i had to wait 45 minutes for my food
Went to Cheddars new opening in Knoxville, Tn. with family for my husbands birthday. One hour and 20 minute wait and well worth it. Great food, great drinks and great service in the bar as well in the dining room.:) 
I love Cheddar's... so excited it is in Roanoke, VA. I have not been there once that there isn't a wait (even at lunch). We waited an hour on Friday night and watched at least 40 people get put on the wait list during that time! With all the competition in the area, Cheddar's is definitely the most popular restaurant! I think they should expand to Salem, VA or Christiansburg, VA VERY SOON! 
Dr. King would have liked NFM. While NFM bakers make the best pecan pie in town (pecan pie was his favorite) we think he would have liked the diversity & sense of community that is your NFM. As we remember him today & reflect on his words & example--we think he would be happy about what we are--& excited about what we can become. Thank you for helping NFM be-NFM!

I'm all for new energy research, in fact as an energy corporation it is to your benefit to explore additional energy sources other than fossil fuels. However, I'm NOT for throwing-away money at the so-called "Green" energy sources, especially if they are not commercially viable and, of course, not if they are not cost-compatible with petroleum/coal/natural gas. Presently, I see NO good alternatives for cheap energy. When Quantum energy transmitters become less expensive, refined, and technologically viable for energy production, perhaps that may yield a new direction. For now, I say DRILL MORE WELLS, and increase petroleum production/make it more efficient. The concept of scarcifying current energy products to justify the use of more expensive technologies, is a dishonest strategy!
Hi Chevron - I stopped at a Chevron station in Buda Texas (off I-35 south of Austin) to gas up last weekend. It was late at night, but the lights were on and the pumps were on. I started fueling, then noticed that the convenience store was empty - closed - no longer in business. I then pulled the hose out of my car and noticed that it was not pumping fuel, it was pumping air. $6.18 worth of air. (thankfully I caught it early) What's going on? How do we get this place shut down?

Are your men better after eating all that soup? Did you post the elk chili recipe? Thanks for all the great tips, and recipes. 
How you feeling?????
Laura, question about your kale chip recipe. I made them this afternoon and they didn't look quite like yours. You didn't mention the temperature of the oven, so I put it at 350. It seemed to be too hot and they were crispy, but also a little burnt. What is the correct temperature?
If you think you don't like kale or greens or anything... just try these anyway. So light, crispy and you can't just have one!
Need to use up some phyllo dough from the holidays.... apple turnovers maybe? Off to the kitchen.....
Can't get enough of this pulled pork... about to have some for dinner (and sandwiches during tomorrow's games..)
Just made creamy San Marzano tomato soup... and a batch of chicken soup with lemongrass, jalapenos, cilantro and veggies. Will post recipes here tomorrow - both were delicious and super simple! Now I'm off to have a glass of wine and relax! Have a great evening!
What's everyone cooking this weekend? I'll be making soups for household struck down by bad colds ;-(

As I know you're used to snow, we here in Georgia are not (but we've got some today). I've made my "best recipe" of hot chocolate topped with whipped cream and chocolate covered marshmallows!

I hate that, that's my fave part! LoL Stay warm and keep cooking:)

+ I dont use the word vegan or vegetarian. I dont like those words. People who chose to eat that way chose to because of ideological reasons. I dont want to denigrate their reasons for doing so, but I want people to talk about plant-based nutrition and to think about these ideas in a very empirical scientific sense, and not with an ideological bent to it. + 
+ .....a vegan and an animal activist; every year he also sponsors one to three students who want to become Jivamukti teachers. He says he doesnt read much, but he has the yoga sutras and the Bhagavad Gita beside his bed, and has written two books himself, the latest entitled Super Rich, based on yogic principles. +
- original - an excellent article!
+ At 6-foot-3, 280 pounds, Mr. Laraque is anything but malnourished. He was moved to embrace veganism in 2009 after seeing the documentary Earthlings about animal abuse. +
- 'Choosing vegan is conscientiously choosing compassion over killing, ecological preservation over destruction, health over disease, and simplicity over complexity.'
"The excuse that it is not necessary to kill in order to obtain dairy produce is untenable for those with a knowledge of livestock farming methods and of the competition which even humanitarian farmers must face if they are to remain in business." - written by Donald Watson in November of 1944 ( source - http://www.ukveggie.com/vegan_news/ )
- article on very actively supporting growers of organic veggies - please skip over the dairy & meat mentions!
 - peppered with confused quotes from the cow abusing 'Vegetarian Society'!
+ For the past 160+ years various 'Vegetarian' Societies around the world have misused the word 'vegetarian' for mixed diets which include animal products such as milk, eggs, honey, etc... - this is unfortunate, especially for the animals & insects which are abused to satisfy the tongues of humans. +
Your Android app has been essential during my holiday in Portland! I've used it every day!
Great way to start out New Year: Wonderful to hear about Costco not sourcing Veal from major animal abusers. Costco has set very strict standards on how poor, defenseless baby cows are treating during their 20 week life. It's a start, i say and kudos to Costco for having a conscience. Every step must be applauded.
I guess the reason that the Happy Cow community is so quiet, is because all the active members are on here (only 2,667 out of a total membership of 24,725!) :-) Just out of interest, Volentia currently has 14,207 members, not bad for just over a year. And yes, I do plug Happy Cow on there too :-)
I just noticed there are no Happycow listings whatsoever in Calabria.

I cant wrap my head around the fact that Auburns team name is the Tigers, but their mascot is an eagle. And then Im a duck. So many glorious animals!
For a duck you sure get on facebook alot! lol love thecomercials!
Do you ever play Duck, Duck, Goose? Or have you become too famous for that?
Hey Aflac... Thanks for Nothing! I like the way you change rules after I have signed up! Now my child which has been in the NICU , is now conveniently Not covered... Apparently you never told my sales agent either!! He has told me that he had these cases covered before! But he was not aware of the change. Guess ...what when I signed up I asked specifically if my then unborn baby would be covered! The answer was YES... I asked even if there were any complications... Keith said YES... Now AFLAC SAYS No.... Thanks for taking my money and not standing behind you word!

Yesterday I had a bad feather day, lost at poker, AND dreamt I was a chicken. A chicken! I need to do a good deed to improve my karma. Whos got a great good deed idea for me?
This is great! Now Aflac Racing fans are getting involved in the bowl game madness. We're transcending sports! Crossing the streams! Getting chocolate in our peanut butter! (Ooh, now I'm hungry.)
Did you know Ken Kesey was an Oregon alum? I bet he could have written a compelling argument for why I should root for the Ducks. So, Oregon fans tell me why Id be cuckoo (a most resplendent bird, by the by) not to root for the Ducks.
Did you see?? You're all famous! The New York Times wrote a great little article on their college sports blog about how you all are helping me choose between Auburn and Oregon! Check it out! 
First winter games were held today in 1924. American Charles Jewtraw won the first Gold Medal ever. USA! USA! USA!

AAAAAAFFFLLAAAAAAAC! sorry, i tried. back to sleep.
Hey Tigers fans, whats this war eagle cheer all about? I find it worrisome Ive always been a pacifist duck.
Thanks to Oregonian Sports for drumming up support from Oregon fans. Hearing an odd silence from the Auburn-area sports publications. What's up, Auburn writers? (And before you call them chicken, know this: Chickens are some of the bravest birds I know.)"
Interesting thing about Jan 2 is if you write dates with slashes the date is one half. Feels like a day since tomorrow its back to work.

Im thinking about writing my autobiography. Itll be called Duck Tales. Oh wait, thats been done. Suggestions?
After yesterday, I'm leaning Auburn. SEC people are crazy. Let's go Duck fans (or anti-Auburn fans) post a vid, pic or something funny to tell me why I should root for my namesake ducks over my local U.

Happy Chocolate Cake Day!!! I'm going to celebrate the heck out of this day. Filled a bathtub with cake and will eat my way out.
Southern hospitality says you support your neighbor. But then again, family ties. Sigh.
The lead singer from the Decemberists went to Oregon, but his latest album didnt have a Ducks fight song on it. Weird. Maybe one of you can write one and maybe Ill even quack it at the big game.
Tomorrow is Chocolate Cake Day. Just wanted to give you fair warning, you might want to get to the store before me or you might not get any cake.
The only thing that makes this Monday bearable is the fact that the Pack and Steelers play on Sunday.
Seriously, I cannot decide who to back in the championship game. Do I root for my neighbors, the Tigers? Or do I root for my namesake, the Ducks? Help!!
Today is Compliment Day. So I would like to compliment you on your excellent taste in Facebook friends. Well done.
Dont know why, but I hate when people say gullet. Its just really unnatural and old sounding. Please stop saying it.
OK. OK. Ive gotten some interesting arguments about who I should be rooting for in the BCS Championship game, but still havent made up my mind. Lets hear it from both sides. Post fun videos or pics that tell me who I should cheer for and why.
So after tallying hundreds of votes -- which is really hard when you don't have fingers to keep track of them all -- I've come to one irrefutable conclusion.This one is way too close to call. I can't pick one, so I'm rooting for both. Roll ducks roll!! And war eagle!! Leave it all on the field, boys, and let's celebrate the end of an incredible football season. I love this game!
So its another award season and you know its nice just to be nominatedat least thats what I keep hearing. Clearly awards are anti-duck.
I've been making dueling recipes for the Bowl games. Tonight it's Middle Tennessee vs Miami of Ohio. Could go with leftovers from the Sugar Bowl but BBQ people would string me up so we're going with Memphis Dry Rub (http://bit.ly/bNONBG) vs Ohio Meat Pies (http://bit.ly/hkT8KU).
Food showdown for the day. Ive questioned this in the past but pizza crustwhat are we feeling? Thin or thick?
Ben Franklin, Betty White, Al Capone, James Earl Jones, Kid Rock & Michelle Obama all born today. Little something for everyone today, huh?
Lets hear it Oregon fansgive me a reason to cheer for the family namepost your best cheers or vids that get me backing the Ducks. Auburn fans? You convince me to root for the Tigers. Lets go!
OK for the food showdown of the day, were going with the sweet stuffvanilla or chocolate. Impossible decision Im making harder by throwing in strawberry. The classic 3, whats your fav?
OK I'm just going to have to leave it up to you, my adoring Facebook friends. Post a video cheer for your team (Auburn or Oregon) and the most creative will sway me to their side. Shy? Post pics or write a poemanything to pull me to one side or the other. Begin.
I want to congratulate the Ducks and the Tigers on a well-fought game. Auburn might have carried the day, but both squads are championship caliber. An awesome end to a terrific season!
If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it should root for the Ducks, right?
Millard Fuller, who founded Habitat for Humanity, is an Auburn alum. So tell me, Auburn fans why I should support his house?
Well, Tigers or Ducks, let's just hope for a game without injuries! (Believe me, I'm kind of an expert in that area. Ouch!) Have a great game, guys!
The first Emmy Awards were presented today in 1941. I honestly don't understand how I don't have one of these babies on my mantle. I'm thinking they are anti-duck. You'd think they'd have a bit more of an open mind.
So Im going out tonight for a big fat burger-which leads to todays food showdown. Fries or rings? To make it tougher, theyre both handmade-never frozen. Lets hear it.
Call me a purist, but all the big bowl games should still be on New Years Day this dragging it out is for the birds. Just not this one.
So we've had a few interesting posts, not still not sure which team I'm rooting for. Oregon or Auburn. Keep the posts coming, be creativeI'll take videos, sonnets, novellasanything you can do to sway me to root for your team.
So I lost a bet and had to eat some dog food. Hey, Im a duck, lets not judge. Pretty bland, but ultimately, not bad in a pinch. I prefer moist over crunchy. And no, sampling both kinds wasnt the bet. Cant a duck be curious?
Okay, how about this: I root for the Ducks in the first half, and the Tigers in the second half. Everyone cool with that?
Ive got the sniffles, but eating chicken soup feels wrong somehow.
You should make a comercial for the BCS National championship that has a tiger in it and the duck is chaseing the tiger, it would be hilarious.
I want to know how I can get my hands on some of the Auburn ducks!??!??!
I suggest you pull for Auburn, Baumhowers has added Duck to the MENU!
Go ducks AFLAC
ROLL DUCKS ROLL!!!!! BE TRUE TO YOUR FEATHERS!!!!
There once was a duck He thought it luck to pull for his friend, the Oregon Duck. He quickly found as word spread around an Auburn Tiger likes to eat Oregon duck by the pound. The AFLAC Duck quickly knew there was only one thing to do... Put on his orange and blue and chant I LOVE AU!
You must pull for the Auburn Tiger's or I have a platter waiting for you on my dinning room table that is just the size for a DUCK!! War Eagle !!!! Hope to see you strutting across the screen!!
You are "the" AFLAC DUCK! Of course you should pull for AUBURN! the war eagle is your neighbor!!! that other duck is just some strange bird! War Eagle!!
Duck ala orange, being served up by the Tigers on January 10th. Stop by for dinner!
I got 2 say duck auburn fans seem 2 have stock in toilet paper 45 minutes is nothing for fans who would roll your HQ everyday 
Ok..to help with your decision of who to side with Monday: Auburn has an actual bird...a real eagle that we actually respsect and allow to open all our home games. Oregon has a cartoon stereotypical representation of a duck and doesn't even have the decency to use a real bird! I think to be respectful of your species and feathered friends everywhere...you have to pull for Auburn! WAR EAGLE!
Hey Duck! Big AL knows who you should pull for!! I'm a Crimson Tide fan living in Tuscaloosa & my home state is OREGON!! GO DUCKS!!
Having trouble choosing? One knows who they are...if they look like a duck, quack like a duck...then they are a duck. The other is confused as to whether they want to be an eagle or a tiger...can't make up their mind. C'mon...ducks of a feather have to stick together!
 go ducks so lets keep it going...... Keep the Duck Wave Going! Supporting the Ducks Run to Number 1! We've started a KUPL Duck WAVE! Keep it going and spread it to your friends! Don't be that guy at the game that has a beer he doesn't want to spill...dump it on the row in front of you and get your HANDS UP for the Ducks!!!
Duck, Duck, lose! WARRRRRRRRRRRR EAGLE! (You're a good southern duck, you should know where your alliance should be!
GODUCKS GO ,DUCKS GO DUCKS!! GO DUCKS GO ,DUCKS ......GO DUCKS!!!!KEEP THE WAVE GOING! COPY AND PASTE! GO DUCKS!
GODUCKS GO ,DUCKS GO DUCKS!!GO DUCKS GO ,DUCKS ......GO DUCKS !!!!KEEP THE WAVE GOING! COPY AND PASTE! GO DUCKS!!! Quaaaak Quaaaa...
ducks neon ducks Yikes
Hey Ducky, what do Tigers have for breakfast?
How does an AFLAC customer change their representative and even service area when their agent has neglected them for many years? I've been trying to do this and it's been impossible. We actually don't have an agent anymore - but the regional manager is Rene Castro in Valencia. He actually insinuated that he doesn't have to give customer service while he's in a training session? What's he being trained on then?
perfect comercial for the superbowl... Aflac running down the field in his own Aflac jersey with number 1 on the jersey.. yelling AFFFFFLLLAAAAC!
ok ok even better thought for a super bowl comercial.. a whole bunch of aflacs on the field. half of the ducks wearing 1 teams jerseys. the other half wearing the other teams jerseys. AFLAC wearing his own #1 jersey.. They go for a play.. AFLAC! he catches the ball and goes with it.. OOOOO he makes the touchdown!

Looking for a great creamy garlic sauce recipe....minus any tomatoes or mushrooms....any ideas?
i have added cream cheese to my spaghetti sauce before to give it a creamy consistancy and for a little kick(regular and garlic & herb flavours)!
Please stop putting Red 40 in your strawberry cream cheese.. Can't you use beet juice or carnine. My little boy loves this cream cheese but he can't handle the red dye.
I am a "new" baker. I decided to make a cheese cake, and thought I would make it a little lower fat. So I bought the 1/3 less fat cheese. Will that be a problem? Thanks!!

Your GARLIC CHEESE is very Very missed!! My Garlic cheese grits are ready for the graveyard without it! Why did you do discontinue that and nippy cheese? HATE it and so do my friends..........New Year's Day is not the same. :((
I love Kraft foods website! I have gotten so many recipes from it and have subscribed to the magezine for years. But if I could make a suggestion, could you please add some new recipes for people who are lactose intollerant? There are so many recipes that have cheese it makes it hard to find something new & healthy without alot of cheese in it. Thank you and have a good day.
i would just like to know what u did to change the original mac and cheese it sure dont taste like it used to.
ok, i admit it..these are my fav's!!!!...........i now buy a box, for the boys, and keep a box, of the big size cheez-it's, by my area......(theyare yummily for my tummily, and i have alot of problems with keeping foods 'down', so i eat alot of crackers)...
Your Cracker Barrel cheese is the best!
JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE THIS, FOR ALL BUSY MOM'S...YES SOUNDS WEIRD, BUT ALL THE KIDS LOVE IT AND IT TASTES GREAT!!! ...OPEN A BOX OF CAKE MIX........TOSS IT INTO A BOWL AND ADD A 12 OUNCE CAN OF SPRITE ZERO, (OR REG SPRITE OR COCA COLA), AND STIR.........PUT IT INTO A PAN, FOR A CAKE, OR INTO CUPCAKE WRAPPERS, IN A CUPCAKE PAN, FOR CUPCAKES, AND COOK AT REGULAR COOKING TIMES....TAKE OUT WHEN DONE, AND LET SIT...THEN FROST AND SERVE......................(NO, YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE THE OIL, EGGS, OR WATER, WHEN MAKING)................. ..LEARNED THIS RECIPE,FROM A GREAT FRIEND, WHO IS ON WEIGHT WATCHER'S, AND WE EAT IT ALL THE TIME!!!!......................ENJOY!!! :D
Just opened a box of your mac and cheese -- I gotta tell ya -- The new box design looks like a generic! I thought my husband bought the wrong brand! Bad design, guys.
Bought & partially ate a Cadbury bar over the holidays & I have a complaint - posted it online at the Kraft site - but no response. Found a maggot (or something) wiggling around - presumably came out of the almonds! So who should I contact at Kraft??
I LOVE Kraft products! I MISS Kraft products. I have actually forced friends to bring large jars of Cheese Whiz with them from Canada whenever they come to visit me in the UK! Do you have any idea what that adds to their luggage weight limit? It took me 4 years to find someplace in Belfast that sold Kraft Dinner. I finally triumphed, but they charge 4.99 a box (!?!) which translates to around $10.00 Canadian! I can't quite bring myself to accept that...but one day soon I know I will have a craving, and I will succumb. I am powerless to resist. I even miss the old Kraft recipe commercials that you used to play during Hockey Night in Canada! There are several generations of Canadians who grew up knowing nothing but Kraft products. And each and every one of us loves you. Deeply. Keep up the good work! Regards....
what was that thing that looked like a squid in that ladys' capri sun over the summer? there was never an official statement or acknowledgement. was it a squid or a fingertip?
Just heard that Kraft foods was offering Ted Williams (the homeless man with the "golden voice") a job!! GOOD for you! What a great thing to do! Makes me feel very good about your company because it shows you community oriented and compassionate. Thanks!
I wanted to type on the WRoP wall a Happy New years to Adam Butler. I can't seem to leave a hello on his profile wall at RWoP.Thank you Kraft for all of your efforts in The social site RWop and for the new Creme. Jason is trying to help me get my Youtube linked back with my account. Please check out my new Creme recipie videos I am so happy to make. I love you all!

 I usually add a couple of squares of dark chocolate into the chili as it is simmering, I also add a few drops of tabasco to my liking.
I know you all posted your 'secret ingredients' on the chili but I've never made chili and would love to know how to make a batch in my slow cooker! I'm all about the sweet and hot and would like to use turkey..Thanks ;)

I was "this" close to buy one of their TASSIMO single cup specialty coffee/espresso maker, when I went to one of their websites. There was the two original commercials and a guy making special coffees. Looks good right!

My 5yr old son is going through a phase where he won't eat meat and I need all the nutritional help I can get. I love the helpful tips and recipes on substitutes to help balance him out.
Ok my fellow cooks. Can I make something with a roux in a pot then transfer it to a crockpot? Or will something happen to that flower when left cooking for a long period of time? Like milk in a crockpot breaks down? I hope that made sense. LOL

dear kraft, thank you for providing consumers the opportunity to give feedback on facebook. also please stop the sneaky downsizing of your products! we are all going through difficult economic times and do not need foodcompanies giving us less and less food for our money! the excuse you gave on page 19 in the february consumer reports issue is appauling: you now sell only 22 slices of cheese in your 2%milk singles instead of 24 slices because:" the larger 16oz package wasn't selling?????" you are cheating your customers by actually increasing the cost of the cheese by over 8% and hope they don't realize it....this has to end! sell the cheese at 16oz as before and if needed adjust the price according to inflation!
case 2: macaroni and cheese packages....macaroni and cheese elbows have 7.25oz, the spirals only 5.5oz...prize is the same. reason by kraft company: "a shape is going to be more expensive and in a smaller box than an elbow...its a premium product and the manufacturing process is more difficult and involved...." people please boycott such practices and stick if necessary to the store brands of these items....you are getting ripped-off.
Does anybody have a recipe to make jello pudding using a non-dairy milk? Like rice or almond milk? Thanks!

I'm making Taco Soup for dinner tonight. It's my daughter's favorite!
Just called and made a complaint about "slimy, yucky" stuff I found in my son's Capri Sun!!!! WHAT IS IT???? Very worried...also have my call into the FDA!!!
After the slime incident...could I make a suggestion?? Why not make the back of the juice pouches clear so that the customer can see whats in there before poking the straw in?? The Kool-Aid pouches have those, and I think that is very reassuring after what happened today! 
Was wondering if the cheese cake flavor of the instant pudding has been discontinued. I can find the sugar free but cant find the regular anywhere.
Well , went to the store , bought a package of Double Stuffed Oreo's and when I opened them found that there is about the equivalent of 4 cookies missing. So I bought an almost full package of cookies. This is the first time that this has happened and might just buy another brand. At least then I know I'm getting what I paid for.
I love your slow cooker saucy meatball recipe! I've made them several times and they turn out great every time! 
PLEASE TELL WALMART IF NABISCO IS KRAFT PRODUCTS.THE CASHIER REJECTED MY COUPONS.

Looking for a easy cheese soup recipe. Any ideas? Also in need of a creamy garlic sauce recipe. Thank you!
I would pick the Neelys to make me dinner
I would pick Guy Fieri because I think he'd be a lot of fun to have around. My husband, though, would probably want Paula Deen so he doesn't have to eat anything really fancy. I always say it's a shame that a guy who loves hot dogs married a girl who loves gourmet cooking!
It's cold as you know what outside, my kids have the 'crud' (not feeling well) and I'm exhausted. We'd all feel better if Paula Deen was at our house comforting us with her food!! 
How dare you stop making the International Coffees. Those of us who cannot have a lot of caffeine in our life settled into a nice cup of coffee with these. And now you have purchased these - changed their name and have just decided to stop making them. I am so disappointed. So much so that if you don't change your mind - I will be boycotting as much of the Kraft family items as I can. I am sorry - but we are just tired of businesses buying out their competition and either ruining the product they purchased to sell more of their original product or stop making the competitive item as you are about to do or to come out with "new improved" versions which are less in quantity and cost more for less. Do you think we don't notice? 
Just wondering why can't we get the Food and Family magazine in Canada and if we can how?
So here is our favorite way to eat the Kraft Swirl marshmallows: place one in the microwave on high just until the bottom starts to puff (around 5 seconds MOL). Flip it over and continue heating a few more seconds until the entire marshmallow puffs, then quickly remove it (it's not all that hot) and pop it into your mouth. It's amaaaazing. Would be great on a S'More, of course, but this is a quick, low-cal treat!
I want to tell you how much I LOVE the new Macaroni & cheese bags that you bake in the oven. These are so close to homemade and they are so wonderful. I have a facebook page called "On the Menu" and every time I make these I just rave about them. I want to be the spokesperson for them & give the person who created them a great big hug. Thank you Kraft for this wonderful product.
I would love to try the new Macaroni and Cheese in the bag, but I can't find them anywhere in our small town.
I can't WAIT to try out the new Cooking Cremes for dinner! Has anyone else tried them yet? I never get excited to cook... thanks Kraft! &hearts;
Do you have suggestions for a low cholesterol and triglyceride diet that a limited income family of two can live with? I like your recipes but some of the ingredients are just too expensive for my budget. Thank you in advance!

Kidney patients can not eat cheese - too much phrosphus and potassium...People make salt free and low sodium items, can you come up with a low phrosphus and low potassium product. There are thousands of dialysis and kidney patients in the USA. A increase in sales wouldn't hurt would it. I for one love cheese but can not eat it any more. PLEASE HELP

Why did you quit making Butter Pecan Instant pudding mix? I make the best desert with it that my family has ever eaten. My son wanted it as his wedding instead of a groom's cake but alas no pudding. I have tried to make it myself, but it just doesn't taste the same. Any chance you will bring it back?
Please tell me how can I get my children ages 2,4,8 to eat their vegtables??? They do not like them I feel like I am wasting so much food!!
I'm looking for the giant bar of Toblerone the 4.5 kg size... yeah it's huge but it's a birthday present/cake. I'm worried that it was only a seasonal item and wont' be able to get one for my wife by mid-February. Any chance to find out who in the US carries these things? I was surprised how tricky it's been locating one.

HELP! can we not have a selection, at least? or just bring the old recipie back! i cant live without it!!

Ok so where might the 20% off my entire online purchase coupon be? The "update" said it would be delivered to and valid thru the 15th. 
Well, I waited all day for the email coupon (which still hasn't arrived) just so I could buy the UD Naked Palett which WAS AVAILABLE THIS MORNING AND THE BETTER PART OF THIS AFTERNOON. It is now sold out again. Thank you, Ulta. The rest of my order can and will be bought elsewhere--this is why Sephora gets most of my and my friends' cosmetic shopping dollars!
How can I get a duplicate receipt? I need to exchange a product I bought. I have been emailing and asking on Twitter and no one responded. I even called but I couldn't get to speak to anyone because the lines were busy.
Service at the stores is horrendous- and I'm sad to say so is online and phone customer support. I was sent used products in my last order and had to call customer service twice where the first rep was just typing and talking to someone in the office but apparently didn't have her headset on because she never acknowledged me. I had to hang up after being on hold for a while and call again.
Kym Johnson prepping for her personal appearance at the ULTA store in Algonquin, IL Salon.
Got my Naked Palette today!!! Thank you Ulta!!!!
I called around to every Ulta to see if you had OPI Black Shatter,at ANY of the stores in San Antonio,Tx. I reached the store at Northwoods Shopping Center,and was told by the Store Associate that there were still Black Shatter in stock. Drove down there a few minutes drive,and what! NO Black Shatter! I was so ticked-0ff! I am never going to shop at Ulta again! 
Exciting new Katy Perry Collection by OPI available now in all ULTA locations! The new collection includes 4 colors inspired by Katy's new album Teenage Dream! With a Black Shatter Nail Lacquer to create a ground-breaking crackled pattern. Only available in stores, not available online.
Just FYI, some stores may not have the "open heart" necklace for the free gift with fragrance purchase of $30 or more. I know we recieved an e-mail in the store where I work stating that there were manufacturing issues. If that is the necklace you were hoping to get, please don't get angry with the store staff as it is not our faults!
YAY!! Got my Katy Perry OPI Shatter Top Coat <3 it!
Argon oil for hair is the best!!!
A store credit will be issued on any return made after 60 days of original purchase date. (According to the Manager at Ulta #378, Manhawkin NJ, this statement, which is posted on the back of the stores register receipts and on their website, is a lie). According to her, AFTER 60 Days REALLY MEANS, WITHIN 60 Days.)

On my third atttempt to actually speak to someone in cust. service. Product didn't arrive, and charged my account plus my gift card without any notification. Let's see, first time, on hold for 12 minutes, then hung up on. Second time, on hold for for 36 minutes. Third time, said I could have somone call me back, it'd be 24-48 hrs. Fourth time, told to call back and press option one. 
I'm having a problem/concern: I ordered the naked palette last week when it was available and I just checked the order status and it still states processing and no tracking info. As far as I am concerned I was billed for shipping for 2-10 days so my question is: will I have my order processed and delivered by the time you agreed to and charged me for? If not I will never order from your site again and I will tell my friends who currently use you to not to do so anymore.

I get a warm & fuzzy feeling when I pass the interstate sign that shows the vineyard where I got married. Is there a landmark (road sign, building, bridge, etc.) that gives you that butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling when you pass it because it lets you know you're about to be somewhere awesome? Happy Friday! ~Michelle
As I watched the play off games last night and saw the sea of fans cheering on their favorite teams, it got me to wondering. How far had these folks driven to see the playoffs? How far would you be willing to drive to see your favorite sports team? 100 miles? 500 miles? Clear across the country? ~Britt
Do we ever "outgrow" our cars? Yes, there are folks who have a sports car, find out they're having triplets and need a minivan. But what about the rest of us? Is it OK to be 40ish a drive a "cute" car? Sometimes I feel like the people I see driving the same car as me are teenagers! ~elia

I passed a small truck yesterday painted with multi-color dots. I eased up next to the vehicle expecting to see a clown in the driver's seat, but no, it was just a man like you and me.

I had a wonderful experience w/ the Hartford, CT store yesterday. Mark H was fantastic and I drove out yesterday with my dream car. It was the best car buying experience from start to finish and everyone who I spoke with was so friendly and helpful. I'll never go to a big, flashy dealership ever again. Thank you!
Shout out to the carmax team and salesman "Leon White" of Tinley Park, IL. He's a professional, that works hard for his customer's. Leon is very accessible and somehow, made me feel, as if, I was a friend and not a customer. Tinley Park "The best carmax for customer service" and Leon White "Salesman of the year".!!!!!!!!

First, I cannot believe I had to like this page in order to make a comment. So I have had my vehicle for about 3 years now. It is a 2004 Pontiac Bonniville that I purchased from a CarMax in San Antonio. I am not rich, nor am I knowledgeable about all car brands, but I went in to a CarMax when I was desperate for a car and needed something reliable, but wanted something nice as well. I am not sure if my sales rep was on commission or not, but he some how talked me in to buying this Pontiac. He advised me that it was a great car, reliable, and kinda sporty, coupled with the CarMax million point inspection I felt like I was getting a good deal and a good car..... 
After owning a Nissan Sentra for 10 years and putting 207,000 miles on it, I bought a 2008 Nissan Altima with 33K on New Years Eve. The experience was fantastic, Tony DelMedico, was my sales consultant (Raleigh, N.C. Glenwood Avenue Location). I almost forgot I was buying a car and not just talking to a new friend. If you have any customer service awards, I would like to nominate Tony!
My mom lives in the mountains and gets her fair share of snow. Recently I noticed she was using a credit card to scrape her windows. What?! She said she couldn't find her scraper and was desperate. Have you used anything aside from a window scraper to remove snow or ice from your windshield? ~Britt
Every day my husband digs my car door when he opens his car door in our garage. Apparently the digs are just part of life with a smaller garage. Does your car take abuse from your friends/kids/neighbors/co-workers? ~elia
Horrible experience tonight at CarMax in Roseville, CA. Had my 2008 VW GTI appraised and appraiser broke my trunk release emblem. Didnt notice until we got home, had to drive the 15 miles back to Roseville only to have them deny it was their fault. Everybody makes mistakes, but they just need to do the right thing and admit they were at fault and FIX MY CAR. Hassle free this has not been.
A shout-out to all the guys and gals in the CarMax Midlothian, Virginia service department... to Chip, Doug, Jana, Susan, and Rick... thank you for the exceptional customer service! I am so happy to have my car back, fixed! 
Brian at the Carmax by LAX is the best ever!!! Just purchased a car from him and I couldn't be happier!!
Thank you to Rachael at the Service Department at CarMax in Hartford, CT! My 3 week old Jeep needed new spark plugs after the check engine light came on. Rachael was courteous, informative and answered all of my questions. While I'm still not really happy that I had to take my Jeep in for service 3 weeks after buying it, I am happy the problem was resolved and I'm still recommending CarMax to all of my friends and family.
We just bought our first car in 13 years at the Fort Worth, TX location. Our sales rep was David Gillilan, and I just want to to say he was wonderful!!!! We have never had a better experience in car buying. David was what every car salesman should strive to be! He was very kind, helpful, and genuinely had our best interest at heart. I would highly recommend anyone who lives in the are to buy from this CarMax! And don't forget to ask for David. He was the best!!
I just got a car at carmax. Is my 1 month warranty FREE??? the aircon is making a "HISSSSING" sound when the blower is on SUPER HIGH>...............is there a deductable??? regarding newly aquired car....holla at yo boi carmax
I just bought my car @ Carmax on Friday @ Rivergate in Nashville. Everyone was wonderful!
What an amazing experience. I never have liked looking for a car whether it was new or used. The whole experience is stressful. Let me tell you, the experience I had with Carmax was wonderful and not stressful at all. From my intial inquiry on a truck to the final purchase was nothing I had experienced before. Derek, our sales rep, was fantastic!! Answered every question we had and if he did know the answer right then, he got the answer within minutes. Elaine in the business office was so nice and helpful also. Great job guys!!!
Roxanne is the best sales person i have ever meet. I have been in sales since 1982, she is not pushy, she is very genuine, and sincere, she will give you all the facts straight no games played here!!
I bought a car from CarMax about 3 weeks ago - I was treated so nice and he only showed me cars in my price range and knew what I could afford every month - they are the BEST - am so glad I went to them - and yes the word is out how nice I was treated - thanks CARMAX!

Can I still buy Farmer's Market posters that were for sale this summer?
I shop every Saturday at the market, and I'd shop mid-week for meat and veggies if this goes through. Three good venues to consider might be the Papajohn Center in the Western Gateway, Greater Des Moines Partnership Building or Capital Square.

The Jones family wasn't necessarily looking for an unusual niche in agriculture when they began growing for chefs, but they were smart (or lucky!) enough to recognize the opportunity when it presented itself. Find out more in Farmer Lee Jones' interview with The American Entrepreneur radio show.

Bocuse d'Or competitor, Chef James Kent has arrived in Lyon, France with Commis Thomas Allan to represent the U.S. in what is considered to be "the world's most prestigious culinary competition." Team USA will be competing against the top culinary representatives from 23 other countries for the world title. We're rooting for you, chefs!
We noticed a little piece of home in this behind-the-scenes look at Team USA at Bocuse d'Or. See what we mean...

Put a new spin on a traditional favorite to create unmatched flavor, aroma and beauty. Citrusy to spicy, pungent to mild, green to opal, we have a Micro Basil that will inspire new tastes for the new year.
Hi, I was just wondering were your seeds come from, or If you might sell them?
wow! i love your edible flower collection!! and im very impressed with all of the asparagus and spinach varieties you grow! i must try the tropical spinach.
In his op-ed about 2011 food trends (http://bit.ly/fwLtbU), Farmer Jones explains that there are endless varieties of veggies yet to be explored. Our selection of six Micro Cress varieties, each chosen to grow for its chef-approved flavor and unique visual characteristics, illustrates this perfectly.
Kim told me I had to respond...PCRM is Physician Council for Responsible Medicine they sponsor a 21 Day Vegan Challenge at various times throughout the year. Thought it might be great marketing for you and them to feature a video clip of your "unusual" veggies and how to use/cook them. Tell Kim Hi from me!
Would Huron's own Chef's Garden, by chance, be the "Ohio farm" sourcing the micro greens on Disney's new Dream cruise ship, as mentioned by Sam Champion this morning on Good Morning America?

Greetings Everyone! I Love Mother Earth and the News! And Being Green! I have a New Years Dream & Resolution . . . . A worthwhile investment for a golden opportunity, to have your own home based business with environmentally conscious land owner, possibly "silent partner." I am hoping to find someone who would like to start a home based business on 6 1/2 farm-able acres with a beautiful historic home place. You could also live there and have office / store. It would be perfect for a natural health food store w/ organic community farm, or Yoga Retreat / Wellness Center, NPO Music Park, ect. We are open to ideas but are looking for the right persons who want to dedicate themselves to a long term business with major benefits. Minimal investment to keep small businesses from corporate globalization. Please email ideas and resume to littlewhitsfarm@live.com Please contact me if you questions or have any ideas!

This is my raised bed using electric conduit pipe, cedar posts for extra support against winter snow. The pipe is arched over the bed and is "anchored" by rebar sticking up about 6 inches out of the ground. This bed was prepared for winter gardening. I stretched 6 mil plastic over the bed to make a low tunnel for growing kale and chard in the winter. This was the second winter I used this low tunnel growing in zone 6 -- it works. Problem areas are keeping the plastic down in strong winds. I used blocks on the ends of the tunnel (stretch tight) and 2x6 boards on the sides with plastic rolled twice.

Tonight you also had a singer at the Shirlington location, and I wanted to check her out, but I had to choose between two good things. If I had a way I could keep a list of all the new singers/artists and poets I'm hearing about through Busboys and Poets I'd appreciate it. 
i'm loving your Poached Pear salad. that jont is hittin all sorts of spots right now. just thought i'd share. 
Busboys & Poets...I am unbelievably saddened by the dismissing of sweet potato fries from your 14h&V location. The first time I caught news of this was the week before Thanksgiving while having lunch with a friend, where I was simply told "we don't have those today"~2 wks later I ordered the same thing and the waitress told me you're not serving them and they'll be back in two weeks... The last time I was in there was Saturday, January 8, and the waiter gave me the same response: "we're still trying to find a new brand of them-I was told we'll have them in two weeks"-I love you guys for more than just your fries, but will someone please provide me with an answer as to when I may get my sweet potatoes fries from there again?! I'm getting dizzy on this merry-go-round. Thank you. ~tawny

Kalyn, I thoroughly enjoy reading your blog. Thank you for sharing! This week we made two of your chicken recipes, four of your veggie recipes... looking forward to more next week! These were delicious. I hope you and your family have been able to spend time basking in the sweet memories of your father. It is hard to lose a loved one.
i've never been a "blogger" but i came across yours while looking for South Beach Diet reciepes! I've had success in the past and thought about starting it up again but i needed something other then baked chicken and fish to eat for the first phase...i'm super excited about starting back up and eating some new and exciting meals! Thanks so much for the inspiration!!!
Kalyn, I know this is a tough time for you, but I just wanted you to know I was thinking of you and your family. You're lucky you had such a great influence in your life, as your dad. Keep those memories around you all the time!
Some great South Beach recipes! Thanks so much! Looking forward to the rainbow trout dressing as this is def a first for me!
Thanks Kalyn for the calendar! :)
Kalya, the pork dish is delicious!! You have introduced me to things I never knew about -- Hungarian paprika AND minced garlic! (I usually just buy it in a jar!!). I think I am on the way to becoming a gourmet!! Thank you!!
thank you so much for giving us options. I cant wait to try the Asian Lettuce Wraps. I am just 1 1/2 weeks in to SBD but even though I look as though I may have lost weight, my scale doesnt show it. I may use another week?
Hi Kalyn, just made your fish sticks and tartar sauce tonight. My whole family LOVED it, even my health-food-suspicious husband. Your blog has changed the way my family eats -- and saved me from South Beach monotony. Thanks so much for the wonderful ideas!! You rock!!
Hi Kalyn! It is only because you share your awesome recipes that I am able to survive phase 1. I made your turkey and white bean chili tonight and it was delicious. I made it exactly per the recipe, as is my custom for first time recipes, and my husband and I were very satisfied. Thank you so much for sharing, and for sharing in such a user friendly way. :) Oh yeah, and your egg muffin recipe has kept me on track for this first week back at the beach. The husband is quite pleased with those as well. :) Take care!
Hey Kalyn! I wanted to share that I made your Not Just for the Superbowl Chili yesterday and it came out wonderfully. I made some tiny modifications, like using canned red beans instead of dried (still letting them simmer in the chicken stock mix), omitting mushrooms in favor of some Green Pepper, and some Hot Mexican Chili powder instead of the New Mexico power you recommended. First time making a chili and it came out great, thanks to your recipe! Thank you for having such a great wealth of SBD recipes I can use, keep up the awesome work!
My husband loves your Baked White Fish with Pine Nuts, Parmesan and Basil Pesto Crust recipe. He makes it whenever he buys Basa fish and it is a hit with everyone. Best of all...it is super easy and quick to make. Thanks!!
Hi Kalyn! Thank you so much for all of your wonderful recipies! My husband and I have lost a combined 60lbs thanks to you! I was wondering if you had a recipe for a pureed butternut squash soup? I just tried some for the first time recently at a restaurant, and would love to try to re-create it. Thanks!
Kalyn, I am so grateful for your recipes! Thank you! You make staying with South Beach a breeze! I made the turkey, sweet potato and rosemary soup for dinner tonight. It hit the spot on this cold, cold night! 
At family gatherings everyone always asks me to bring Deviled Eggs, Summer Tomato Salad, or Pinto Bean and Avocado Salad. All recipes from your blog. Thanks for making me into a kitchen hero!

Just made your White Bean and Artichoke Dip today for my snacks at work this week, don't know how long it's going to last though - It's Wonderful!!! I'm still in Phase 1 so I can't wait to make it with the Whole Wheat chips.
Can you please share your thoughts cause I'm seeing mixed reviews - is fat free sugar free pudding okay during phase one? Your site is great- I'm so glad I found the website and now the Fb page too.
So happy to have found you....I have just started Phase 1 of the SBD and live in Italy...no pasta, bread and red wine is going to be hard so I will distract myself with your glorious recipes! <3
Hi Kalyn, I made the balsamic vinaigrette in the book. (Phase 1) But it tastes too oily. And it needs something else added to spice it up. What do you suggest? Thanks, Erin
Hi Kalyn, I', trying to find the pizza recipe that had the small portabella mushrooms as the base.
Kayln and family- so sorry for the loss of your father from afar in Australia. Thank you for the wonderful history of his life you posted. Lovely family memories for you all. 
I am so sorry to hear about your Dad. I can't imagine not having mine around. I pray that God will give you strenght in these hard times.

Save the date! Planning is underway for Cook Childrens 29th Annual NICU Reunion - scheduled for Sun., April 17. A formal invitation with details will follow.
William is very gifted. His drawing is very good for his age. But it is so sad that his brother was taken away from him. I am sure that picture is forever etched in his mind along with other, hopefully happier, ones. Perhaps, it will be William who finds the cure for Childhood Cancer. Then, all those windows at the top could be for looking out at a better world!!
This picture of Juju and William is wonderful! Two brothers who were so darling together. Sweet memories for William to smile about! Love to you and the family, Mimi..........and to Julian, too. Karen
Do you want to be a part of all the action on Super Bowl Sunday? The Super Sunday Morning Hope Walk and Fun Run will begin and finish in Sundance Square adjacent to the ESPN stage and a portion of the proceeds benefits Cook Children's. Sign up for the walk!
We are so proud of our nurses!!! They work tirelessly to provide outstanding care to the patients and families we serve. And, because of their efforts, we are so proud to share that Cook Children's has achieved Magnet Re-designation. This voluntary certification program for hospitals recognizes excellence and professionalism in nursing and is widely accepted as the gold standard of patient care.
We are looking for volunteers for the new Parents Coffee Hour! Here, parents have a chance to enjoy coffee, tea or soft drinks and snack while participating in fun activities with other parents experiencing similar medical situations. Contact Tamela Grass at Tamela.Grass@cookchildrens.org or 682-885-5480 if you are interested in being a volunteer!
Our SVP of Corporate and Community Affairs, Tim Hanners, was featured on Good Morning Texas this morning talking about the Super Sunday Hope Walk hosted by Darrell Green and Tony Dorsett. The walk is on Super Bowl Sunday and benefits Cook Children's. Don't miss your opportunity to get in on the action!
William was only 2 when his brother Julian was a cancer patient @Cook childrens .Today he is 5 and a half . He just drew this on a dry erase board. He said all the windows at the top were for the cancer kids... Just thought Id share...
I can't "like" this page enough!!!! I remember all of my trips to Cooks. The doctors, nurses and support staff are all amazing! So many memories! 
Instead of receiving gifts at her birthday party, our daughter would like to request that her friends bring a book that can be donated to Cook's! Is that something that you can use or would you prefer school supplies, toys, etc.? Also, where should we bring the items once they are collected? Thanks!
So today is our first day at home and I have had the privilege of being Garens patient today! It&#039;s amazing all the little things he picked up on while we were in the hospital and his interpretation of all of his caregivers. Even more amazing is to watch and listen to the way he reenacts our stay at Cooks.<BR />He laid me down, listened to my heart, took my blood pressure all while telling me it&#039;s gonna be ok. Then decided to give me a shot. He said this is going to hurt for a second then it will be ok. I got the shot then he handed me a Teddy bear and said it&#039;s all over and it&#039;s going to be ok. <BR />Once I quit crying ( he told me I had to cry). He said I could have the Teddy bear for awhile but I would have to leave it do the other kids would have it when they needed it. <BR />Garen does not seem to have any negative emotions toward the &quot; hospital&quot; and I know if I had been stuck as many times as he was and purposely starved for 24 hours it would not be a good place to me. This is truly a testimony of Cook Childrens Medical Center. They have a great hospital with awesome staff and amazing child life!! Also, great volunteers!!
Alexa Sankary, who was named Cook Children's first Young Philanthropist, was recently named as one of the 2010 People of the Year by Fort Worth, Texas Magazine. Congrats Alexa!
The AYA (adolescent young adult) Cancer Program had a great surprise on January 11! Nine girls that are battling or have battled cancer were taken by a limo to Shampoo hair salon in Fort Worth and treated to a day of makeovers and a photo shoot. Thank you to Shampoo salon (hair and location), Vandergriff in Arlington (limo), JillJohnson (photos) and Amy Custer-Williams (makeup) for making this day so wonderful for the girls!
Our son JC is from San Antonio and was diagnosed with hyperinsulinism @ 8mos. Today we had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Thornton in the endorinology clinic & it was a wonderful experience. Thank you to the staff @Cook Children's for making us feel so welcome.
I just personally want to give a shout out to Dr.Bankole Osuntokun with the Gasteroenterology clinic on 8th Ave/Summit Ave in downtown Fort Worth. There is so much that I could say about this wonderful doctor. I wish he was more than just our G.I doctor. He knows more about my son than any of his other doctors. It just awesome when you can talk to a doctor and he actually listens. Not only is he focused on Bubbas reflux but he was also very interested in his Autism. He is very patient with my son and we just LOVE him!! 
It was one year ago that my 10 week old son was airlifted by Teddy Bear Transport to Cook Children's in respiratory distress. As I watched the transport team take him away, my only comfort was that he was going to Cooks. Today, Levi is a beautiful, healthy 14 month old and I know that we still have him because of the extraordinary care given to him by Cooks. I wanted to take the time today to thank all of the doctors, nurses, and staff that were there for us during the multiple hospital stays. Words alone cannot express our gratitude. North Texas is blessed to have such an incredible children's hospital to take care of our most precious gifts.
I got my cast from Cooks when I lived in Granbury. I live in Sweetwater now but my 1 year old little sister with Down-syndrome had her open heart surgery there a few months ago and she is doing amazing!!! Thanks Cooks!!! :) 
Our Teddy Bear Transport helicopter has found it's way to the new helipad on top of one of our parking garages. The old helipad is soon going to be home to our new specialty clinic building!
Have pancakes and help children at the same time! IHOP locations in Arlington, Burleson and Fort Worth are raising money for Cook Children's in February. Childrens Miracle Network Hospitals Miracle Balloons will be sold for $1 and $5 each from February 1 through March 1.

Ya'll need to talk to Chicago SoyDairy about getting their new vegan mozzarella sticks into the restaurants. People are flipping out over them! So far only Chicago Diner and Palomino in Milwaukee have them. The TC would be an excellent third place with all the vegans chilling here. :) I think you guys already use Teese from Chicago SoyDairy as your vegan cheese? Getting the mozz sticks wouldn't be too hard, then? I'd eat the HELL out of them as would all the dozens of vegans I know. :D
Pizza Luce, please open in Stillwater, MN. We need you there, you'll be successful there. Really!

To everyone that posts utter ragers on here regarding how "awful" American Airlines is -- I've noticed something. If you use the approach / language / generally horrible demeanor typically displayed in posts, then I can start to understand some of the problems that you see. While I've certainly experienced my fair share of folks who provided less than 100% awesome service, persistence and politeness have generated more dividends for me in the long run than (a) firing off an {often} poorly worded ALL CAPS message on Facebook (b) spamming every comment on the page, or (c) venting spleen on some hapless GA who can't affect things...just a word to the wise. Next time try a smile and hello before you light the flamethrower. Sometimes that is just enough to make you stand out and you'll get what you want right away. Let the flames begin ;-)

Ricardo, je prparerai tantt la lasagne la mijoteuse. On dit de prendre des ptes non cuites. S'agit-il des ptes ordinaires non cuites ou des ptes lasagne qui n'ont pas besoin d'tre cuites (genre direct-o-four)?
Trois recettes que j'ai essay dans le dernier numro et trois fois dlicieuses : Que faire avec les restes de viande fondue, soit le sandwich bagel et la soupe vietnamienne tout fait savoureux et la lasagne la mijoteuse qui est ma foi, surprenante!! Vraiment trs bonne!! J'ai fait la sauce tomate de Jose Distasio pour la recette et ce fut un franc succs! Faut dire qu'avec une bouteille d'Amarone reu en cadeau Nol nous tions en "voiture"!!! :-)

(En passant tant hypo je dois pas manger de farine blanche, donc les recettes doivent tre faites de farine de bl entier (ou sarrasin, etc...) Merci d'avance!
Bonjour, j'ai bien envie d'essayer la "Soupe aux saveurs de hamburger"... mais mon fils est allergique au poulet et la recette contient 5 tasses de bouillon de poulet, je me demandais pour le got si c'est mieux de remplacer par du bouillon de boeuf ou du bouillon de lgumes? Merci

Marie-Christine BouchardJ'aime la cuisine de Ricardo! Souvent je fais ses recettes, elles me vont trs bien, c'est--dire que je les russies chaque fois.
Sticky toffee Pudding: tout simplement dcadent! Nous sommes une gang de bibitte sucre et j'ai doubler la recette de sauce...La prochaine fois, je vais la tripler! Merci pour cette belle recette, faire absolument, surtout par cette temprature frigorifiante!
Un conseil svp: j'ai fait le Sticky Toffee Pudding. Un dlice. Quoi faire pour que les dattes ne tombent pas au fond (j'ai le mme problme lorsque je fais le gteau Reine-lizabeth.)
Vraiment excellente et de circonstance pour souper ce soir, la soupe gratine l'oignon et aux tomates (dans le tout dernier magazine ;-))
C'est rare mais je n'ai pas aim la lasagne la mijoteuse. J'aime pourtant pas mal toutes les recettes de Ricardo. Je ne sais pas si j'ai fait quelquechose de pas correct, mais les ptes taient trop cuites, les lgumes pas assez. La chair de saucisse tait prise en gros moton de saucisse. Pourtant j'ai suivi la lettre. 
je l'ai fait et l'ai beaucoup aime. J'ai cependant diminu le temps de cuisson 3h30 plutt que 4 heures. Les lgumes taient croquants sous la dent mais on a aim. C'est vrai que la chair de saucisse tait en motons. La prochaine fois je la mettrai qq minutes dans le robot culinaire pour la dfaire plus facilement.

je me demandais si vous aviez envisag de faire la recette de "lasagne la mijoteuse" avec de grosses coquillettes ?? Je regardais a aujourd'hui l'picerie pour acheter les ingrdients mais je trouve a dommage de casser toutes ces lasagnes... les grosses coquilles sont des ptes assez longues cuire qui peuvent supporter la cuisson lente je pense et c'est rond :P en tout cas, je vais l'essayer voir ! :)

I Grew Up on this Great Tasting Cereal and Just Had a Pot Full This Morning and I'll Be Eating it 4 The REST Of my Day's Here on this PLANET !!!

2005 Samarra, Iraq. B Co 3-69 AR, 1HBCT, 3rd ID. This photo was taken specifically for the workers at Malt o Meal. During the early years of the Iraq war, Soldiers stationed at Patrol Base's away from Large Forward operating Base's were hardly ever supplied with food. As having been a former employee of Malt o Meal, I wrote a letter telling them of our situation, and they graciously sent us some cereal! This photo was taken to send as a thank you, but technology was not perfected then, and the photo was lost sitting on my computer. I recently found it and wanted to send it out for all to see. Thanks again for supporting members of the Military. Your support was greatly appreciated!
I love Honey Nut Scooters. My favorite thing (next to their deliciousness, of course) is that I often find little hearts in the middles. :o)
hey just an idea...fruity marshmallow maties ...haha im sold, i would buy it faith with the rest of the cereals i buy (only malt o meal, taste better ,best!) seriously...i dont think im the only one thats had this thought ,right?

The Glazed Doughnut Burger was the BEST thing I have had there, by far! Can't wait for it to be on the menu again!! 
Hey, TCT, is the Valentine's Day dinner $75 per person, or per two people. I think per person, but wasn't sure??
Thanks for another great meal today. Mom loved the Southwestern Grilled Chicken Sandwich! :-)

London wants to make all fish and chips sustainably sourced by the 2012 Olympics. Think it's possible? 
Ok, I have not seen this movie yet but I plan on it. In the meantime I thought I'd give you all another reason to eat fresh and clean. The other day I went to eat some "all natural" Udon soup. Imagine my disgust when I found this vacuum sealed package of noodles with mold or who knows what on it. Expiration date is 2012 so it should have been ok, then again I have to ask why would I want to put something with a shelf life of over a year in my body?

Just watched this movie, we need to wake up America, I'm going to buy more DVD's & give then to our local libraries, & friends to pass around. Thanks for the great job on this movie.
Watched this movie March 31, 2010 and became a vegetarian on April 1, 2010 and I couldn't be happier with my decision (not that I ate meat that much to begin with). 
i fully support your cause but please stop posting things that could encourage people to put INFANTS on a diet! those kinds of scare articles only hurt the children they claim to help.
I just watched your movie this past weekend! I was fully shocked and sickened by it all! I work in a fast food resturant at the moment and I went into work on Monday thinking about your movie in all that I do at work and it makes me ill. I wish I knew about all of this before! Thank you for opening my eyes to all of this.
i now am a veggieterian
almost a wk meat free!
New years resolution is to tell everyone you are, Monsanto and support/own the FDA. I want people to know they have been used and lied to by food inc
At one point we'd eat from the tree, from the ground. It was all life and therefore man didn't die. When he put death into his body, he started to die. - Elijah Muhammed. Eat to live.
-Anyone have something to say about this claim??? American Farm Bureau Federation: "In 1944, we needed 4 cows to produce the same amt. of milk as US farmers produced in 2007. This productivity gain has reduced ag's carbon footprint, feed demand, waste output & land and water needed, and boosted overall sustainability."
thank you for helping me change my life :) this movie was just the push i needed!
We just finished watching the movie, And we are very proud of all who took part in it...We will now only purchase locally grown,organic foods :) Bravo to the cast & crew of FoodInc!!! One huge green thumbs up to all of you <3
I just wanted to say that your video has changed my life for the better! I am now so much more aware of what I eat, and I pay so much attention to controversies and problems and all that now! Keep up the awesome work! 
this movie is a real eye openner!!!!
I can't believe I've seen this documentary only now. Shame on me. I am, however, going to recommend it to everyone I know.
just watched the movie! thank you for opening up my eyes! you are so right we do have the right to know what is in our food! 
You feature Chipotle on "special features" and you have the owner talk about sustaiability and all... on the movie you talk about meat packing industry and big corporations exploiting undocumented immigrants and basically getting rid of them when they start making more money or are seeking benefits...ejem well.. news to you...maybe but CHIPOTLE is doing just that! They are firing massive amounts of undocumented people they have used fort years and years... it's documented, it's out there, it's happening now, talk about CHIPOCRICY!!

Just watched on netflix wii. Thank you. 
It is kind of sad: you purchase cabbage for a stew..forget to use it within a week..yet...6 weeks later...it is STILL ALIVE due to the GMOs used! (was afraid to use it) (all is the same with the "bagged salad". I had these in the fridge way before I went organic..I think it was November 4th of LAST YEAR..
Better know what we eat! Food comes with a basic trust and we are witnessing the trust disappearing slowly...!!
Dear Valued Customer: Thank you for taking the time out to contact Mission Foods with your question. We do not use genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, in our tortilla strips. We hope this helps you. If you need any further assistance, please feel free to contact us again. Mission Foods 
Watched it tonight then checked my fridge. No more rotisserie chickens! 
for the "inquisitive minds" here is the letter i wrote: Produce?! organically, you do NOT carry cabbage! I asked the "produce manager" if there were GMOs in the produce..he did not know! ("If it is not in the organic section, then we know it is not.") THAT gives me the answer! So going on the comment of your manager, it is GMO; PLEASE respond promptly to correct this issue. 
I've just watched this for the first time just now. I have always bought fresh food and know how evil multinational companies are
Thank you for enlightening me to the dangerous defiled meat I was consuming from my local supermarkets. I am only going to buy from local butchers and farmers markets from now on! 
Just Finished watching Food Inc and reading The Omnivore's Dilemma. WOW.....very sad...
I loved the documentary! In my opinion I think people would eat healthier if food prices didn't keep rising! You would think that FOOD companies would want their consumers to be healthy and in order to do that they would have to keep THEIR prices average with most other foods!

I'm looking for a post for friend from a few weeks ago about sea lice killing the wild salmon and I can't find it. Didn't you post that?
Most people are as much removed from reality as the processed chicken is.
every american should be forced to watch this documentary, too many people are ignorant and turn a blind eye to the horrible things these companies are doing, we should QUESTION the status quo not shrug our shoulders and move on, and that's where the average citizen lost their power. Boycott everything these bastards put out, they are slowly killing and fattening this nation, not too different from they way that they kill their livestock.
I found the trailer of this film today because it just begin showing from this January,2011 in Japan. I believe I must check it out...

Hey guys, check this out! Seeds for Haiti what a great cause!!
I just saw the movie two nights ago. I am in the restaurant business but it really made me deeply re-think what have we put in our mouth and to serve customer for many many years. I have a six years old daughter and am very sensitive now what I feed her. Thanks for the great effort to let us see the behind the supermarket shelves.
This is a wonderful EYE OPENER about the FOOD we put in our mouths...but this is only the beginning! I URGE you to join my group BUILD YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM to learn about natural ways to heal your body using HEALING FOOD, grown from the earth...and learn what foods to stay away from! I urge you check out the articles and then choose your next meal wisely!
i have watched the video and really liked it. but from what i have read on your facebook it seems you are against meat instead of the real issue and that's factory farming and the fact that teh problem is no one raises their own food anymore and we buy what the corporations tell us and they know we cant afford all organic and grass fed meat so they have the people locked in. why are we not talking bout that on here?
why does eveyone think this is an anti-meat video. really? are people that blind? it is not that at all. it is an anti-government/corporation video. why are people blind to this? goes to show they only take what they want from things and twist it around to make them look better. 
I am hoping that the "big event" in 2012 will be the end of the meat market, pesticide companies, and the end of the big greedy corportations (medical companies, OIL especially, and political corporations) We need to revolt as citizens of this EARTH. We come from nature, we are nature so why are we hurting that which is part of us? REVOLT!!!! I personally eat organic, travel less, keep my tires properly inflated, support local businesses and i spred the word. Do what you can! Spred the word!!
I wrote Ihop after my daughter had an allergic reaction to food she ate there. (I know it's something in the Italian Salad dressing. Their response "Thank you for your recent request for a list of ingredients for IHOP's menu items. Due to the frequency in which we change our menus, as well as the small risk of cross-contact, we can not provide the list you requested. The health and safety of our guests is simply too important to risk sharing inaccurate or outdated nutritional information." WTF?
I wish more people would understand and get this message..
Does any one know if it is legal for restaurants to grow and serve their own fruits, veggies and herbs?
is this cancer generation due to factory farm meat? cuz cancer, every1 seems to have it.
Love this movie. It should play on mtv instead of Jersey Whores every night, then we maaay actually have a shot at fixing something in this fucked up world.. That is, if any of the viewers have a conscious..
I think the best thing that could have happened to my son - as hard as it is - is a corn allergy - yeah - no more soda!!!
so, with the latest news re: CEO's from Whole Foods Market, and Stoneyfield Farm backing off from the fight against GMO giant, Monsanto, will you still 'like' Stoneyfield Farm? I see them as traitors, and will no longer buy their products.
Why wasn't there any mention that Genetically Engineered Alfalfa has been degregulated on this page?
now lets be serious this is not my true opinion but it's a thought u are going to die it is written and lets not fool ourselves eating unhealthy food will shorten your lifespan but if u live long do you really want to be eating tofu for the rest of your life. live a little take chances sure you canget sickness from red meat and die but u can also die from looking at the sun too long or getting hit by a drunk driver life is full of risks so take some can living a long full life really be better than having a good time at the burger joint with a couple of riends think and eat with a purpose 
Just watched it again!!
Wow I watched it today and just changed my buying habits. The chicken I bought today that was free range tasted better than any chicken I've had in a while. Coincidence?
So excited to watch Oprah Winfrey Show on Feb. 1st, 2011.She & her employees went on 1 week vegan diet, inside beef factory and Michael Pollan!Should be interesting and hopefully eye-opening...
Did you guys even read bill s510? I just dont understand why you would support this bill that would basically eliminate small organic farmers not to mention the fact ecoli contamination is caused by factory farm run off.Which you stated in your own movie. its a shame 
I entered my kid into the Full Circle Skate move competition that you advertised, with a youtube video of her doing some nice circles on the ice. What's the status of that?
Please put Promised Land White Milk back on the shelf in Cape Carteret. I don't know why it was removed, never enough stock to last until the next delivery. The chocolate milk is still on the shelf but it sells out in between deliveries. 
My digital coupons did not work today :( I checked the ones added to my card before I left the house (I was going to use the .50/2 Betty Crocker Fruit Snacks any flavor/variety). I bought 4 boxes of BC variety pack. It did not take it off. I double checked my card number and that it was loaded to my card when I got back. Not too worried since it was only 50 cents, but just wondering if I missed something. I had loaded them a few days ago.
i had a quick question what is the employee assistance program that keeps being taken out of my pay check? i didnt sign up for the insurance.... i was just wondering

Where are the pictures of the Game Cave photos being posted? 
Just a shameless plug for my man cave. Unfortunately one picture doesn't do it justice. Please vote and let's make this a closer race than it currently is. Thanks everyone!
Hey, it might not be as modern as some, but its still a pretty sweet place to watch a game or a race. Any votes would be greatly appreciated!!!! 
Well I got a message saying that my entry to the game cave contest was successful, however, my photograph is not posted on there. Any idea what happened? 
Please vote for our Game Cave. It is awesome. One picture doesn't do it justice. On another wall is a ten foot movie screen - definitely the place for game day. :) 
Although I looked over and read the rules, im missed the rather important part that clearly states that I am ineligible enter, please remove me from this contest and good luck to the Winner. Thank you.
Please vote for the Wolf's Den. It is the ultimate game cave. Full bathroom, full kitchen, pool table, foosball, pinball, ping pong, 10 foot movie screen, strobe lighting for those that like to dance, surround sound. Ask the neighbors - it is the ultimate place to hang out. Please vote!! We are about the 5th photo down right now. 
The Wolf's Den is set up just too sweet, everything is wood and stain, no paint. what a dance floor, and a fully stocked bar. Did I mention the signed Goodyear Racing Eagle from Dale Earnhardt Sr?

is really looking forward to the new store opening in Graham, NC -- we're going to be so fortunate to have a FreshSmart without having to go to Burlington or Mebane!!! :-) 
We have had the same problem with the voting. I can't tell you how many people have called saying they can't figure it out - but with specific instructions it works - just not very user friendly. 
If you're not quite sure who to vote for, consider voting for me and my boys. Personally, I think it's crazy to award someone for having a lot of stuff. We believe it's not about what you have but WHO you have with you that matters, so, if we win it, we pledge to donate the $1000 Best Buy card to raise money for to fight hunger. (I'm thinking raffle it off for the Souper Bowl!) Vote for the Black & Gold! :)
I would like to thank everyone for voting for the Wolf Den, we put alot of work and thought in this and it turned out great. I wish we could share it with everyone so they could enjoy it as much as we do. Omce again, thanks everryone, keep it up.
Thank you Lowe's for an awesome time at the Ice Skating Chamionships!! You had us in a VIP suite - with VIP seats, snacks, drinks, sandwiches, desserts, even wine and beer! And our own private bathroom! I did not get the name of your associate who was with us during session 16 but she was awesome and I would like to thank her very much!!! Thanks again for a wonderful time!
I am wondering why my game cave pic did not upload and the site won't let me fix it. Anyone know how I can repost the pic? I doubt that anyone in the contest will want to help me with this, but I would really appreciate the help. Thanks
Voting in the Game Cave contest is way too difficult. Attempted to vote 4 times before my vote actually counted. People are probably thinking that they have voted but some of them are not going through. 
I have noticed that the bonus fresh reward items haven't been in the sales ad for a few weeks now. what's up with that? you aren't getting rid of the 5 dollar fresh reward coupons are you?

Our cave is a slight 130' hike across the creek and up the hill in our backyard. It is a game cave and tiki bar all in one and you would have to see it in person to get a full understanding of what's there. Almost like a rustic cabin in the mountains even though we are in Greensboro, NC. It has a covered tin porch (10' x 20') on the front with a bar and porch swing, side porch (8' x 22') with a granite covered bar that opens to the game cave. Inside you will find karoake, Harley Davidson pinball machine, projector with 80" inch screen, XBox360, PS2, pub table, fridge, microwave, cook top, and all kinds of cool sports memorabilia. Belly up and name your poison! We certainly could use your vote.

Have to cook! But I also have to include my own touch. Just made challah in the bread machine Hesh got me at least 2 years ago. We are resisting $3.79 a lb challah at the store, although this is a fair price we are being impoverished by Sparta's tax policies so have adopted frugality to survive. Who else has this problem? Make filet mignon at home that I bought for $2.99 a lb. after Thanksgiving. Thanks, Mr. Romano.Chicken is still affordable, but vegetables have to be chosen carefully to avoid waste.

Hello! Just wanted to leave a little feedback. We recently received our new cans (a couple months ago), one for recycling one for garbage and since we've begun using them I could have sworn I saw the garbage men putting my recycling in the garbage truck time and again. I chalked it up to a new system, maybe a new type of truck.
Good morning. I understand the bill goes up when the gas prices go up and they can't get our trash when the weathers bad, but why do we have to pay a full month when last month we didn't get our trash picked up two weeks in a row?

Red Bean baked buns - recipe from "Asian Dumplings."
Also Char Siu Pork! We are hosting a dumpling party in honor of the lunar new year.
I love it when people share their personal stories. Thu took the time to write a really nice family story. I couldn't keep it to myself! 
If the New Year means a less meat or vegetarian New You, this creamy dal recipe will suit your needs. Shoot, I served it with tandoori chicken last week!
Pho terrine, beef pho broth with chicken, pho with cuminy rice paddy herb -- it's all happening in DC. 
It's not just an Asian thing!
Just finished off the Chicken Pho broth last night Andrea. The broth is clear. The broth is tasty. Should make for a mighty fine dish later this afternoon. Love your recipes!
A mutual friend - the one who I believe took you to Fubon - recommended your Dumpling book. We got it. It's excellent.

b"Happy New Year! The Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 11.02 percent to investors in 2010. The S&P 500 returned 12.78 percent. Ball's stock? 31.62 percent ... 32.58 percent if the dividends were reinvested. Not bad for a 130-year-old packaging and aerospace company!"

Hi, George. Happy New Year! I have a George Foreman Deep Fryer. It spins the fat off the stuff I deep fry. That's a great thing but I don't see any mention of it on your website.
Does anyone know...can I cook bone in chicken thighs on my George Foreman???? I am assuming yes but just want to double check :)

I really like the George Foreman Smart Kitchen Multicooker! Pretty awesome for stews and pasta!
Bought the Evolve Grill with wafflet plates. Really loving it so far however are there any tips to making the waffles? We did not spray the plates because my husband thinks he read somewhere not to. The first time it overflowed so we obviously overfilled it but everytime after that they are breaking apart - top and bottom. They are still DELICIOUS but there aren't any directions in the book for how to make them. Thanks.
ever since I got picked up ur grill ive been grilling mad food. easiest shit ever.
I've been loving George Foreman (the man) since his fighting days, and been cooking with him since 1998. Through high protein to vegetarian, vegan and back again this cooker has been the best. Super Champ, all the way!
can you make miracles happen? how do you make a meatloaf with this thing? 
Ima grill some chicken breast 2 nite georgey boy
french bread french toast on the quick, you know your going to try it!
I have the small one I used it for the first time 2 days ago I had boneless skinless chicken breast I cooked it for ten min I found that it was to hot I wish the small ones had different setting's So you can cook on a lower heat. I must say that I do Love it ,tonight my daughter came over and we did steak's on it .It was really good But I don't know if I will use is as offen as I though I would I just don't like that it just has one heat for every thing you cook
YEAH BABY YEAH ,,I started with the small one and now own the bigger version ,,this thing makes great meats I love it
does anyone know where I can get a GGR62? It's the largest and one of the first GF Grills. It's a Lean Mean Fat Grilling Machine. I've had mine for sooooo many years and it's still works but it's showing real signs of wear and I don't want to be without it. Let me know....and thanks

I like this grill because its easy to clean and i don't have to wait for a long time to cook a hambruger or hotdog Its just a easy way to cook some thing fast WITH OUT THE WAIT
Our new 360 Grill that we got for Christmas doesn't seem to heat up enough. We have tried letting it heat up longer and that doesn't make a difference. Our quesadilla's are never browned. No matter how long we let them sit they never brown. They cheese melts but that is it. My husband was cooking burgers on it and they never would finish cooking so he got out his small foreman and cooked them one at a time without issue. What could be the problem?
Burgers cooked on my George, I don't own the grill.
I love cooking Crappie and Walleye on the Geo. Forman. Spray with pam, coat fish with fish coating, preheat for 10 Min and cook.
I once had a GF grill that came with a rotisserie. I had used that grill just about every day once I got it. I loved doing my country style thick cut bacon on it. All the fat gone, but I ended up with the best tasting bacon I ever had. Plus, them ridges kept the bacon from shrinking. I used it for just about everything I could think of. Because of the grill, I became just about a good cook as my wife. But, the thing is, I killed that grill from over using it. Now I need to get another one. But this time, I need to get a better one, compared to the one I had. I also like the stand up outdoor/indoor grill. I have a terrace where I live, my apartment is a co-op, and you already know that I/you cannot grill outside on the terrace. So with the GF outdoor/indoor grill, which happens to be smoke free, I can get away with it. I can have my own bbq party out on my terrace and host my guests with no problem. Thanks Champ... 
george do you a cook book available for sale? if so where could i buy it. marge d.
RECIPE: Breakfast Eggs McForeman
Anyone have the new "Smart Kitchen" Multi-Cooker? I got one for Christmas, but it didn't come with any recipes, except rice. Can I get rid of my crock pot and use this instead? I love my GF Grill with the removable plates. I want to love this product, too.
I just made Bacon on my Foreman Grill, and I did not burn my foot !!
I have the large george forman. I can cook 12 hamburger's at one time.. great for a party.
My brother borrowed my first George Foreman Grill and never gave it back. I finally gave up and bought another one. It's the greatest thing when you live with a steak loving man.
I have the large one with removable plates that I purchased for myself as a Christmas Gift to myself, I live alone. Best Christmas Gift I ever got. LOL I am also a diabetic and it makes preparing my meals so simple. I put whatever piece of meat I have chosen, pile on the large sliced vegatables, throw seasoning over the entire stack and let it grill. Taste great.
The UPS man just delivered my first ever George Foreman Grill...... Does anyone have a recipe for chicken tenders?
Hello group! We still have our original lean mean grilling machine. It's got to be 10 years old! 
I just got the Searing Skillet looking for some good recipes if anyone has any... :) thanks
Love making quesadilla's.. yummy......
Thanks Mr.George Foreman for the cooking grill.I love the way it burns fat,cooks the meat until it's all the way Tnks again,see ya later.

the george foreman grill can cook everything. i even cooked a pizza with it calzone style
I just used my George Foreman grill to make grilled onions, zuccini and yellow squash for dinner - with a few portobello mushrooms. Delish!
I purchased my grill a while ago and actually forgot that I had it. I finally used it to cook some steaks for my family. All I can say is WOW!!!!! That much taste in that small amount of time. I don't think I will ever cook steaks without my grill again.

Looking for easy ways to raise some dough for your favorite non-profit? Contact your local California Pizza Kitchen to arrange a FUNdraiser!
Chinese chicken salad! Definitely by far the best salad I've ever had. 
Ever get a craving for your CPK Favorite twice in one week? If you ever consider starting your week off with a little BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad and ending it with a Welcome-To-The-Weekend Butter Cake, here's a little something for you!
We were GREAT fans of CPK frozen pizza for many years....and about a year or so ago the pizzas just weren't the same....they tasted of cardboard and we stopped purchasing them. For whatever reason, we were compelled to try again hoping that they would be the tasty frozen pizzas that we loved years ago....BUT....alas, I have to say that it was totally inedible. The crust was worse than our last taste and the toppings flavorless. Whatever happened to this brand???? 
the white pizza with chicken and spinach is the best
I checked the balance on my CPK giftcard, and it says ZERO. I bought a $100 giftcard back in December, and haven't used it. I have my American Express statement that states the purchase ($100.50). What's the deal CPK? Please help me figure this out. I am very upset right now.
I miss cpk's pizza, pasta and potatoes!!!

If you guys decide to offer a kids eat free or cheap night, please let me know and I will add you to our list at Macaroni Kids Rockville - Gaithersburg.
What has happened to this WONDERFUL Pizza? I LOVE the White Cheese w/Spinach, but the last 4 that I bought at DIFFERENT Stores, were a mess .... half the stuff was missing? I would rather have this than a restaurant pizza, but if the do not get better, I will quit buying!
I just stopped in to say "I LOVE THIS PLACE."
A Nut In A Nutshell blog sent me!
I had an interesting customer service experience at the CPK at Easton Shopping Center in Columbus, Ohio. I took my cousin, and she had never been there before. We were waiting for our food and the Manager, Aubrey, brought us a pizza that would have been acceptable anywhere else, but not what I know CPK is capable of. The outer crust on, like, two pieces was a little burnt. This is where my customer experience gets interesting. Aubrey told me that they had put in a new pizza for us, but we could go ahead and get started on the one she brought. I'm telling you, the pizza she brought me first would have been fine, but Aubrey's excellent customer service skills made my CPK experience unforgettable. It was great. I applaud CPK!

Did I read correctly, Norfolk Southern, will revive it's steam excursion program?
Regarding your steam operations - what potential exists for NS steam excursions in NJ or PA?
We had a truck pull out in front of an Norfolk Southern train in kentucky. Sadly the train crew didnt make it. Please may the hearts and prays goout to the family of the crew of that Norfolk Southern crew. 
I just got to say Norfolk Southern Is the nice railroad they let u take picutres and do not comapliant unless it is nessay to for safety and Sumerset Nice group of people to know 
How do we start our day off at Norfolk Southern? We do warm up exercises to help prevent injuries.This picture is of our engineering department this morning at Lambert's Point Yard in Norfolk, VA.

Dear NS, I love your Pittsburgh Division!! Spent many hours listening to Doug Traubert ( spelling? ) and train crews while driving between Alliance, Ohio and Conway Yard and beyond. Keep up the Great work!! A Railfan for life, Dawn Anderson :) p.s. you have a Signal Maintainer or maybe a Track Inspector ( can't remember which ) named Rikaldi ( again with the spelling, jeesh ) umm, he has a nice voice......haha
Do you have any updates about the steam program that is supposed to run out of TVRR this year?
Jimmie Rodgers, "The Father of Country Music," was a New Orleans & Northeastern brakeman from 1918 to 1924. He became known for his original songs influenced by his railroad background. (BMI/MichaelOchsArchives.com). He also worked as a switchman for the Southern Pacific.
Norfolk Southern!!! You have a proud history, and an even promising future, our country's future is linked with yours!! Please bridge the gap with the public and market and advertise yourself so that the citizens of this great land will know how vital you are to our transportation infrastructure. 
I am really curious about this, and not sure if you are permitted to divulge any information about it, but since steam is coming back to NS this year is there any plans for the use of 611 for excursions in the future? Would VMT let NS take it back? How would it be restored to FRA standards so that it could steam again? Would it need to be towed somewhere?
NS Any news on the Steam Program?Southern 630 is getting close to being finished!! We in Chattanooga are excited to ride the rails again!!!!! Look Ahead, Look South!!
When R-U Going 2 Paint The Rest Of The Fleet, Like NS999... Want A Green Engine For Your Profile Picture 4501 Or 6900 ?
Question about the 21st century steam program, will the excursions with locomotive 630 only run from Chattanooga this year? Where will they run to? Will they depart from TVRM's Grand Junction station and head the other way (opposite from the direction they normally go toward East Chattanooga) onto NS? An idea, the excursions could run to Knoxville or Atlanta if heading that way from Grand Junction. Or, is there an NS connection in downtown Chattanooga near the Choo Choo hotel area? Maybe an excursion to Birmingham as well?
Trainees learn how to work on diesel engines at our McDonough Training Center. Safety 1st!
Today was a big day for all of us who are fans of the Virginia Museum of Transportation and steam! The arrival of the C&O 614 was watched by many of us from all over the world on the museum's new web cam! Thanks Norfolk Southern Corp for facilitating the move!! You are a Class 1 railroad in every since of the word!! THANK YOU!!

I found where two of your 2011 Calendar Photos were Taken one was taken In Alloy, WV which is in Fayette Co. & the other one was taken in Chester, WV which is in Hancock Co.
It is just after midnight and I was checking the rail cam before shutting down for the night and there is an eastbound train sitting idle with a red caboose at the end of it, which is so cool! Since most trains don't use a caboose, I'm wondering if this is something special that NS uses? This is the second time I've seen it on the cam: The other time was last Thursday night around 10:30 and it was a westbound train in reverse--the caboose was the lead car. Can anyone tell me more?
NS has got some great dispatchers in Roanoke. It don't see how they can remember who they have talked to on the radio without some else calling for them.
Doesn't NS teach it engineers how to handle a train without dynamics? I just heard a engineer that wouldn't leave the year without his dynamics.
I just wanted to say that I LOVE MY JOB!
Question...After 1 year as a conductor, you could be chosen to become a engineer. If this happens are you still a conductor or are you considered both a conductor/engineer.

 think it's high time that Staples issues an official statement regarding the use of coupons purchased from eJunkie, SD'er Club, etc. Are these REAL Staples coupons, or are they fraudulent in some way or fashion? If they are fraudulent, then why haven't you shut them down and/or invalidated the coupons? If they are real and valid coupons that are being sold, then let us know. I won't use them because I firmly believe they are fraudulent, and using them is coupon fraud, which is a punishable offense. Please help us, your customers by finally making an official statement, so we can either quit using these things, or start using them in order to get the best possible deal that we can.
To keep this short, my husband purchased an HP netbook ($430) for me and gave it to me on Christmas. I used it with no problems half a dozen times the first week or so of January. Seventh time it would not turn on. Charged it up for a day. Still no turn on. Brought it into Staples on my way to the office Saturday morning and was told they could not repair a netbook, would not exchange it out for something comparable nor would Staples refund my money because they only had a 14-day return policy and that tiny window of opportunity was closed to me. I was given a hand-written phone number on a scrap of paper and was told to deal with Hewlett-Packard directly. I'm flabbergasted at this treatment. How many other people bought netbooks a week or so before Christmas to give to a loved one on Christmas Day? If you purchased the netbook 2 weeks before Christmas, and found out on Christmas Day that it did not operate properly, guess what? Staples says, "Sorry....call HP."
is it just me or do you believe staples is stealing your money when they issue "REWARDS" with expiration dates. I had 12 dollars worth of returned ink cartridges that I am crap out of luck on because I could not or did not use when they said I should! I think this is stealing my time and money any one agree?

Just an update - we're working diligently on resolving the issues that have affected Garmin.com and Garmin Connect today. Sorry for all of the frustration, and thank you for your patience.
Congrats to the Garmin marine team - the GHP 12 Sailboat Autopilot has just won the 2011 Pittman Innovation Award from SAIL Magazine! More details below, plus look for it in the February issue of SAIL on stands soon. 
Hi everyone - just an FYI that Garmin Connect is going to be down for about an hour today (1/24), starting at 3 p.m. Central. Thanks!
While Garmin.com seems to have stabilized, we're still working on resolving the major issues affecting the accessibility of Garmin Connect. To answer some of the questions regarding your activities, they're all still safely stored on Connect and we're working around the clock to get you back online and logging more runs, rides and hikes. We'll keep you posted.
Track what you love - a child, pet, boat, car and more - with Garmin's GTU 10. It's small and lightweight and easily attaches to a backpack, pet collar or whatever is important to you. Learn more here: http://sites.garmin.com/gtu/
I bought a Garmin last year...spent well over $200 and SEVERAL places aren't showing up on there! Someone told me you get free map updates...how do I get them?
I'm thinking of buying a 405cx, I was wondering if it is water resistant. I do triathlons and would like to be able to wear it on the swim portion of my event. Is that possible with this watch? Or should I get the 410?
Just purchased the Garmin forerunner 405CX. I hope I like this. The watch seems rather big and uncomfortable for my small wrist.
Can anyone explain to me the difference between routes and waypoints mentioned in the specs of the car satnavs? The lower priced devices only have waypoints and not routes but I've heard you can bodge a route by having a long list of waypoints. So what is a true route and what's the advantage? What I want to do is to force the satnav to guide me along a specific path between my start and end points, with no leeway for the device to change my planned route whatsoever.

Food memories at my dorm in UP consisted of adobo that mom cooked for us. See in the dorm, we were not allowed to cook our meals. Moms adobo did not contain any soy sauce and so it is often referred to as the white adobo
The Kiam Pung looked interesting to me because of its similarity to Paella which I love to prepare. Take a look and see if you can also prepare this for Chinese New year. 
There are so many versions of adobo and each one of them tastes just as good. This adobo version uses buko juice that adds zest to the sauce.

I just finished watching a TV show called Supermarket Inc, a CNBC TV production. It was a very interesting documentary about how the supermarket industry works and how store get customers to spend more money. I was just curious to see if anyone else has seen this show and has an opinion about it?
Have you noticed the hexagon shaped images on shelf tags in our stores and wondered what they refer to? The system is called NuVal which scores food on a scale of 1 to 100. The higher the NuVal Score, the higher the nutrition. Its that simple. http://www.hy-vee.com/health/nuval/default.aspx

We're not into spreading rumors...but weve seen a lot of you speculating about the Verizon iPhone rumor on our page today. Here's what Boy Genius had to say about the topic: http://go-att.us/tfjh If there is an announcement, we'll share our official statement with you right here on our page!
Hey guys, just a reminder during this especially rough winter weather season (snow in 49 states is just too much!)if you ever need emergency help, only CALLING 9-1-1 from your mobile device works. Texting doesnt! Be sure to give the operator your location, what the emergency is, your callback number, and your name. Be safe out thereespecially on the roads!
You may have heard the announcement about Apple's iPhone. The iPhone will continue to be a better experience with AT&T. We offer the nation's fastest mobile broadband network (35% faster on average nationally vs our competitor's CDMA network), the ability to talk and use apps at the same time, unsurpassed global coverage, and access to our entire national Wi-Fi network, at no extra cost with smartphone data plans.
Were making a minor format change to the AT&T Facebook page in order to share information more efficiently. On Monday, the default view of the page will be switched to AT&T only so fans can see the latest news from the company at first glance. You can easily see all of the Wall conversation by changing the Settings back to AT&T + Others. We hope this change is helpful and look forward to hearing from you.

Wondering what to do with left over beans or rice? Add 1/2 cup of cooked brown rice & 1/2 cup black beans to Amy's Chunky Vegetable Soup! Do you have tips for turning a can of soup into a meal?
Did you know tomorrow is National Vegan Pizza Day? :) http://www.poortastemag.com/vegan-pizza-day-is-coming-time-for-doughy-boot-camp/ Thank you, @QuarryGirlblog!
I was appalled to see that Amy's who is supposed to be all organic has Yeast Extract. Wow it has the same effect as MSG.That makes you no different from Cambells and that food is not good. I have been buying your products for years but you need to take the yeast extract out of your food or me and the people I know will not buy Amy's anymore.
chunky tomato bisque rocks my socks off!
that black bean enchilada meal with rice and beans--so, so good. thanks for making healthy choices easier for us in this busy world!
Thank you for all the gluten-free choices! Love the rice flour, no cheese pizza!
We tried the choclate cake and it was fantastic!
I love your pizza, the crust is unbelievable! Trying the kids meals mac and cheese tonight. I'll let you know if it gets the kids approval. Thanks for making this line of food. Everything else I've tried has been delicious.
I love your new vegan chocolate cake! Delish!
Thank you for all the Gluten Free options!!! They are so good!! Your GF Vegan mac n cheese is AMAZING!!! I have been using Amy's for my family since the early 90's and you keep getting better and better!!
Just finished the Tofu Scramble Mexican. It was so delicious. I had the regular Tofu Scramble with Vegetables the other day, and love how the food really does look like the picture on the package down to the two slices of tomatoes. Thanks for providing an honest and excellent product.
I am eating the Chunky Vegetable Soup... and its my favorite.... thank you
I love your soups. And I'm eating one right now. Go NorCal!!
We love the Samosa wraps!
I added some freshly sauteed mushrooms and spinach to the vegetable barley...wow! :)
Dear Amy's, I've been a fan of your delicious breakfast, lunch and dinner items since 2000! My all-time favorite is the Tofu Scramble with Hash Browns. Recently, I can't find them at the grocery store. Please say you have not discontinued it. ;-(
PLEASE offer more delicious Amy's at Costco!! I am heartbroken over the loss of the multi-enchilada pack! 
Just had your Shepherd's Pie for lunch! Yum-mo!!!!
I eat the no cheese vegetable pizza several times a week--so good!! There is no other pizza that compares.
Just tried the Indian Mattar Paneer, and it was superb! Thank you so much for making such great products :)
Anyone shopping Amy's in the Atlanta area? Wondering who has the best variety and inventory? And at good prices. My local Publix has the small pizza for over $8 - seems high, no? For the small one? Are there coupons ever issued? Both my husband and daughter have celiac and Amy's has some of the best GF food, especially the mac n cheese. Thanks!
The Tom Kha Phak is off the hook! It tastes like lobster bisque!!
Just scarffed down a broccoli, cheese and veggie pot pie! my absolute FAVORITE!! :D

Rice pasta mac and cheese= INCREDIBLE!!!!!
Dairy-free Mac and Cheese was inhaled last night by my two dairy-free boys last night. THANK YOU!
just tried the Margherita Pizza yesterday and it was the best frozen pizza i have had in a long time.Thanks Amy's
Love your soup but stopped eating it when I could not confirm whether or not you use BPA in the lining of the cans. Can you let me know? Thanks.
Hi! I'm a huge fan--your Matter Paneer, Cheese/Veg Enchiladas, Potato Bowl, and a bunch of others have been in our weekly lunch rotation forever. I bought your veggie burgers (1/4 pounder patties) for the first time at Whole Foods in DC last week. Opened them today and there were only 2 patties in the box, as opposed to the promised 4! Honest mistake, I'm sure, but wanted to let you guys know. Thanks!
The Chocolate cake came in the Tofurkey roast. YUM!!!!!!
BRING BACK FAMILY-SIZED MEATLOAF PLEASE! 
First off, thanks so much for creating quick meals I can actually eat (gluten-free, dairy-free). LOVE your products. As big of a fan I might be, I am wishing you could re-think your packaging graphics as I've purchased the wrong product twice in one week and was dangerously close to a bad allergic reaction each time (not to mention stuck without food I could eat). It is really difficult to distinguish the difference on the retail floor, especially when call-out badges mean different things across the product line. 
Every store in my area (Metro Detroit) is out of the Vegan Macaroni and Cheese (dairy free, soy free, gluten free). Is there a shortage? I'm allergic to cow's milk, and this is the only one I can have.
Your Mac and cheese is so delightful!!!
Just popped a Veggie Lasagna in the Microwave...Num num num!
I love Amy's because it's healthy, delicious, perfect portions, and it doesn't taste like frozen!!!
I love Amy's because it's healthy, filling, and low calorie!
Because it is so amazing! Omg I could live on just your products! 
I love Amy's because our children LOVE their food, begging us to go to Whole Foods to stock up!
I love Amy's because its nutritious BUT ALSO VERY DELICIOUS! and I'm sensitive to gluten ;-)
I love Amy's because it is tasty organic and natural, unlike some stuff that just tastes like cardboard. variety is awesome, and I love how they have a meal plan for diabetics
Have you stopped making Fat Free Alphabet Vegetable Soup? It was my absolute favorite, and I can't find it anywhere in San Rafael! Please say it's not true!!
Awesome flavors, completely easy and convenient, affordable and organic! Those ar just a few reasons why I always have Amy's stocked in my kitchen!! <3 you guys keep up the great work!
I love that you provide Kosher and organic options that I can feel good giving to my family! With 5 kids I need all the help I can get!!
We love Amy's soups! My favorite is Black Bean and my son loves lentil!
I love Amy's because of the amazing mushroom and olive pizza, vegan mac and cheese and the CHEESE ENCHILADA! I love that the foods are organic and easy to make for a total non cook like me!!!!!!! 
I can always trust Amy's to nourish this vegetarian when I don't feel like cooking!
I had your pizza for the first time :) very good! 
I just made chili Cheesy mac with your GF Rice Mac and Cheese. My Daughter who doesn't usually eat it! LOVED it. Mac and Cheese I can eat, and something different for a change of pace for my chili! SO good! LOVE your Rice crust pizza too! Just need to make room in my freezer for that next! I bought a whole case of the Mac and Cheese....You can NEVER have too much!
Oh wow... I think the light soft taco bowl might be my new favorite Amy's product! Thank you for making such tasty, healthy food! <3
just found these dinners - they are amazing!!
I love your products. I just recently began to eat them. I saw them on sale and one of my co-workers was telling me how healthy and good they were. They are so good!!! A little pricey, but I buy more when they are on sale. They taste so good and are so filling. Keep up the good work and have more sales.
Just tried the Fire Roasted Southwestern Vegetable soup - SO DELISH I COULD EAT TWO CANS!!! Thanks for your yummy products, we LOVE them in our house!
Thank you, thank you for your gluten-free foods! It has saved my life these past four months since I discovered that my son and I are gluten-intolerant! It is THE most convenient quick food for our family when we are rushing around during the week. THANK YOU!!!
YUM! I LOVE your delicious foods! Just got done with a hot bowl of your spicy meatless chili. I am excited to see that you have some great looking pizza's now too! 
I just wanted to let you know that I think your organic lentil soup is so unbelievably good.
like you 'n Leslie Loves Veggies sent me. susan wiener
I just tried the Light and Lean Spinach Lasagna. I was surprised at the fact that I could pronounce all of the ingredients. (nothing artifical). It's absolutely delicious. Very fresh tasting. Can't wait to try the other meals. 
Love the Gluten Free Baked Ziti....great topped with Feta~~~
Your TERIYAKI BOWL was AMAZING!!!! thank you for making such flavorful gluten free foods!!! <3
Currently eating the vegan organic split pea soup! yummmyyyy
Mmmmmmm to everything Amy's!!!! The Mexican Tofu Scramble is my absolute favorite!!
Light and Lean showed up at my King Soopers last week.. eating the Pasta and Veggies right now. It's really good. Another great product. :)
I am in love with your rice macaroni with dairy free cheese. I thought I would never have mac and cheese again. (I can not have gluten or dairy.) Thank you so much! Keep up the great work.
Your non-dairy products make me feel like I can make the switch from vegetarian to vegan. Thank you for making such healthy, delicious food!
Just started last night...I'm addicted! 
Love your pizza's and frozen meals and soups.......hey i love it all!! Great Food!
The crust on your cheeseless pizza is so heavenly! With Amy's help, I'm going to try my best to be vegan again...!
I am making a wonderful veggie recipe using Amy's veggie chili!! Yummy!!
Eating my favorite soup for lunch today, Amy's Organic Black Bean Vegetable. Yumm!
Tried your cheese pizza pocket for lunch today. A-mazing! 
tried veggie soup for the first time, AWESOME, bought more and and can't wait to try them!
Every Amy's meal I've had has been wonderful! I do have a question though: has the Mexican Quesadilla with Rice & Beans Kids Meal been discontinued? I can't find it in my area anymore and it's been taken off the site.
Hello, I was digging through my cabinets and looking at the dates on the canned foods I had. Surprisingly to me, I found many that said "Best By" or "Best if used by" with a date following, including month, day and year. I do not know how far beyond that date I can safely eat canned foods, most are soups and just needed to be heated, so I assume they were cooked prior to canning, or partial cooked. I understand the "suggested" date may cover legal issues, so I am not even sure you are able to give me a straight forward answer, but I would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks .
just tried amy's cheese less pizza which mushrooms, onions and artichokes. mmm. that was yum!
Wow !! I just tried, for the first time, the Tortilla Casserole & Black Beans meal & I loved it !! Totally vegetarian, all organic & it was surprisingly one of the best frozen meals I've ever had !! I am looking forward to trying more of your meals !! Thank you so much !!
The Pesto Pizza is my absolute FAVORITE Amy's Product. I LOVE that I can read and understand each ingredient! 
My favorite item so far - Bean & Rice Burrito - Non Dairy. We just found the Light in Sodium Bean & Rice Burrito (Dairy Free). Yay! And I just read about your Gluten Free, Dairy Free Mac n Cheese made with Daiya. I will be looking for it!
Just finished the Cheese Enchiladas and I had them with an orange and ice water! SO FULL and the enchiladas have only 260 calories!! Not bad for a fullfilling lunch!!
'EAT FOODS WITH INGREDIENTS YOU CAN PRONOUNCE DAY' READ THE LABEL and free yourself from additives and preservatives... Just say NO to High Fructose Corn Syrup, Aspartame, MSG, Nitrates, Sulfites, Benzoate, artificial coloring and many others...on APRIL 22 (also Earth Day) Please repost to start spreading the word... HELP TAKE BACK OUR FOOD !
Love the Mexican tortilla bowl...black beans so yummie! 
Thanks so much for making such tasty vegan/vegetarian food. It makes my life easier when I cannot make it myself. Carrying out 2 bags of frozen food/canned soup tonight and wondering what I want to eat first. Maybe the Non Dairy Vegetable Pot Pie or the Thai Coconut Soup? So many wonderful choices. Thanks again. 
i am officially addicted to amy's tomato bisque! i even got my mom to love it-(she doesn't even like any kind of tomato soup!)... 
It's about a million degrees below zero in Chicago. You're creamy mac and cheese tasted sooooooooooo good on a day like today.
Thanks for all the vegan items. Even more thanks for labeling them as such!!!! I hate reading labels. I love how that is the first word on all Amy vegan items ! by the way I am sooo addicted to the pot pie pocket and the non dairy pot pie dinner
Amy's I would like to order 100 boxes of mac and cheese please.... its so good you should have a breakfast mac and cheese to a make it part of every meal. 
Mango! But there are mango bars at Whole Foods to tide us over!
i LOVE your pizzas.....please, is there one large enough for me to live in? i am in love.
we tried your organic orange cake...was very delicious !! 
Thank you for your line of non-dairy foods. My dairy-allergic son's first pizza and pot pie was from Amy's Kitchen! :)
I have a vegan daughter and spent many a night feeling guilty that I couldn't properly satisfy her cravings and food needs....since I started buying your products everyone is happier!
Please tell me you are still offering the non dairy mac and cheese!! It seems to be being replaced at our grocery store!!
Amy's is AMAZING. I love food, and had a difficult time making the transition to vegetarian. With your selections I don't feel cheated and can eat guilt free :) Now considering vegan!!!
<3 <3 <3 your broccoli bowl and so did my 6 year old and 3 year old :) THANK YOU!!!
 Amy's Organic Minestrone Soup Rocks! 
Why not have more products in Canada like the Cheese Lasagna
<3 <3 Non-Dairy Vegetable Pot Pie ROCKS... it's good every time! <3 <3
OMG! I just had your mexican tortilla pie Light & Lean Dish.....it was so so so YUMMY! I could go for another, especially with the stats it has...only 220cal!!!
Just made your Chunky Vegetable soup with the suggested brown rice and black beans, it's a winner! That's a soup I probably would've never bought had you not suggested the recipe, but now I'm going back to buy all the cans of this soup! Keep the recipes coming. Thanks, Amy's. =)
 So proud of the "light-in-sodium" options i just fround in the freezer at publix!!! I will be purchasing those items on a regular basis now! Please feel free to lower sodium content in all your products. 
The contest back on the 11th- I was one of the first 20 people to comment on the profile (not on the post) No one ever said which one it was suppose to be so I was just curious since I have not heard anything. 
We tried one of Amy's frozen "whole meals" last night. It was a veggie steak burger with mashed potatoes and green beans and it was very good!:) A little high on the total fat count if you're watching that but not bad and all organic natural ingredients.
What happened to Fat Free Alphabet Vegetable soup?? It's nowhere to be found here in San Rafael!!
It's snowing out and I just pulled a hot Amy's Non-Dairy Vegetable Pot Pie out of the oven! So good!! P.S. I'm working on saving up my 25 UPC's...lol!
I have to tell you how much you made my day today. I just had 6 immunization shots in my arms for my tour of Egypt and I made a bowl of your Amy's Vegan Barley soup and instantly felt a little better :)
I wonder if any stores in DFW other than Target will ever stock the Light & Lean line?
I'm addicted to the Texas veggie burger. I thaw in the microwave for about 1-1/2 minutes then fry in olive oil to brown it. Then I assemble the burger with green lettuce, tomato and pickles. To add my own little quirk, I then eat this with soy sauce. Sounds strange, but it's good that way!
Just tried the gluten free cheese and bean burrito. YAY! It was fantastic (like all your food) and will be my new breakfast on the go!
I put Amy's Black Bean Soup in my slow cooker vegetarian chili recipe...its a PERFECT base.;-)
just ordered another 8 cases. 4 tofu scrambler, 1of each lean pasta, kids meal baked ziti, southern dinner and veg. korma. luv ur prouducts. wish u used all white paper for ur plates and bowls. dont like them black bowls 
Good move with the Golden Lentil soup!! :)
I just indulged in your mac and cheese with a slice of high fibre garlic toast..favorite lunch ever! Amy's I love you!
Chunky Tomato Bisque and a grilled cheese sandwich... the perfect dinner after a day of shoveling and playing in the snow. Can't wait to try some of the other varieties!
How about a gluten-free version of the California Burger (no soy of course)?
PICKET WHOLE FOODS TO PROTEST GMO ALFALFA!! This Saturday, 11am at your local Whole Foods. Bring your friends. Bring a cow. Nothing is more important than protecting of food supply from this soul-less Monsanto.
I heard I should be saving up my proof of purchases and mailing them in. Is that true?
Just tried the Tortilla Bowl today- yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
Amy's pizza is on sale at Fred Meyer for 2 for $10 through Saturday! 
Boo hoo! I can't find your Alphabet Soup ANYWHERE! My two local Whole Foods used to carry it, but now it's missing from the shelf! It's the ONLY soup my 3.5yo twins will eat! Did you stop making that style???
On my trips to the grocery store, I usually head straight for your palak paneer. I'm vegetarian and I love having a fast meal option, like this, for nights when I'm the only one at home and don't want a production of cooking. Last night, however, I tried out your tortilla casserole bowl - could you guys make better frozen food?! I didn't know that you could have 'food fandom', but I totally get stoked when I come to the freezer section now.
I can't WAIT to try your new Sonoma burger, it looks PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!! how do I get a store in my area to carry it?
At this moment i am eating an Enchilada Verde with spinach and cheese and i'm loving it.
Just had the verde spinach enchiladas. So good!
Your Palak Paneer is delicious! Just tried it today and I am hooked. Please don't ever let it go away. :)
Hey guys! I got my Natural Balance Pin from the Rose Parade contest you had! Thank you so much!! Seriously the coolest float I've ever seen in a parade! Also, I hear my dogs munchin' down on your LID Lamb and Rice dry food right now! :D

Has anyone else had this problem? This is 1 scoop of Natural Balance & I brushed the food to the side...the rest is all powder! I have had this problem a number of times & am now considering switching my girls to a different brand. I breed English Bulldogs & have used Natural Balance for a number of years & it has always been great put this past year I have had this issue a number of times! The other problem is when we buy dog food we buy in bulk because we have a number of dog & the closet Petco is over an hour away. Well when we have this problem we have it with a lot of the bags because they are all from the same batch :(
My Katie just discovered Bison, Liver and Lamb flavors of canned Natural Balance. All three are her new favorites!
Can't wait to get my 2011 Natural Balance (featuring Tillman) Calendar at Happy Dog in Camarillo, CA! Happy New Year to all my furry friends around the world!! And don't forget, Tillman for President!!!! 
Just want to thank you for making such wholesome food for dogs and cats. I made the switch months ago to Natural Balance for my shepherd mix Allie. She absolutely loves the Sweet Potato & Bison formula. I also cut up the food logs for her "treats". Everyone that meets her always comments on how gorgeous and shiny her coat is. I always tell them it's thanks to Natural Balance. 
Thanks for your great and wholesome foods for our dogs. We made the switch about 5 years ago and it made a world of difference. Our yorkie quit having "hot spots" and our lab quit having seizures. The rest of our pack just loves having tasty, healthy food! Please post video of the float in the parade!
Love Love Love Natural Balance dog food! how can I become a representative? I love telling people about the change in my dogs coats! They are SOOO beautiful now with this food! 
Are y'all going to be doing a calendar giveaway this year too??
I can't help but wonder what you have in store for the 2012 Rose Bowl Parade Float.. How the heck will you top this years float? Maybe Agility dogs doing "Their Thing" On the float? By the way.. if you need a Gorgeous Well behaved German Shepherd for anything.. just let us know! :-)
I've started switching from the Science Diet Active dog food to you Duck & Sweet Potato formula with my two Scottish Terriers...and they have been picking out your food and leaving the Science Diet in the bowl! One of my Scotties suffers from allergies, and I was told to switch to your food from one of your sales reps @ the Indy Pet Expo...I'm thinking this is going to be worth the hour+ drive to get to a store who carries it! :) thank you for creating a food with the dog in mind!
I'm on the Board of Save-A-Pet Adoption Center in Grayslake, IL. We are a 501c3 no-kill animal shelter in business since 1972. We are having a Pet Safety Day on Feb. 19 and I'd love if a Natural Balance Rep were to attend with a product demo. I LOVE Natural Balance LID duck & potato. After my dog suffered for years from allergies, the LID duck & potato is what finally worked and she loves it. She's a 14 1/2 yr old golden retriever and still going strong with the help of Natural Balance. Thank you! I'm hoping you have reps in our area. Can you help us out PLEASE?
My dog Abby is a 10yr old white boxer and a cancer survivor with allergies (go figure right she is a boxer after all)...she eats nothing but NB Allergy formulas. Whenever strangers pet her they can't believe how soft she is and no one believes she is 10 they all think she is a much younger dog! Thanks Natural Balance! ;)
i've been trying to find the nutritional information on your LID line! help please :)
Any thoughts on bringing Reptile Diet to retail sale? Even if I could purchase it online instead of at my local Petco, I would love to be able to feed it to my rescue snakes. I don't have the heart to feed them live rats and I don't trust the nutritional content of frozen rats 100%. As always, NB pet formulas are fantastic... my rescue dogs and cats all eat it and are very healthy!
Is it ok to feed my dog the LID line, even if he doesnt have allergies? Im thinking of switching him to Sweet Potato and Fish.

We recently switched to this grain-free food for our 11 yr old german shep female and the difference is amazing. She was born with an auto-immune disease that we were not expecting and at 4 yrs developed pannis of the eyes. She loves this food and the grain-free treats as well. You can see the difference in her spunk. Thank you soo much. She is a happy dog :)
Our littlest family member Turtle has been a Natural Balance cat since she was a kitten. Now that we are moving to Denmark, we're worried about her food options once we are over there (it seems she would rather starve than eat anything else). We haven't found a way to get Natural Balance internationally, and hope that you may have some suggestions or know of some comparable brands in DK. Thanks!

Don't forget some of your favorite "non-veggie" vendors have year round store fronts in the Omaha area. Le Quartier Baking Company, It's All About Bees, The Tea Trove, Caffeine Dreams, Great Harvest Bread & Harvest Valley Foods, to name a few - - send us a note if you need help locating one of your favorites during the off-season!
Curious what your favorite vendors are doing this time of year? Here's the answer from one of them: "Right now we are looking through our seed catalogs and we're getting ready to gear up the green house in February. We'll start flowers along with lettuce, herbs, cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower. By Mid March (weather permitting) radishes, green onion sets and spinach are planted in the field."
Another vendor update: "Just got back from the Great Plains Growers Conference and a Hi Tunnel workshop. Lots of neat ideas on how to grow a cleaner, better vegetable in less space. Also got good info on extending growing seasons and bringing in an earlier harvest. We're also considering expanding into some specialty Asain vegetables and root crops such as Ginger."
is just around the corner (we know it's hard to believe with all the snow on the ground) and getting ready to update vendor applications!

No 12th Man flag when the Seahawks are in the Playoffs?? At Home?? Thats just wrong.
Please raise the 12th Man flag to the top of the Space Needle to recognize the NFC West Champion Seattle Seahawks! It's been three years since fans have had a chance to witness our flag flying high over the most recognizable landmark in our city. I hope we won't have to wait any longer! 
What is the price for an adult to go to the top?
I should win the tickets to Bears vs. Seahawks because 1) this is the first year (in my six years) in Chicago that I haven't made it to a Bears home game. And 2) Seattle is on my list of places to visit and dinner at the Space Needle might be just the motivation I need to book a flight!
I should definitely get to go to the Bears game, since it is almost my birthday, I am either celebrating a new job or sad I have to stay at my old one, and I am the biggest fan out there. Plus I'll stay the whole game, no matter how cold, and yell really loud when we win.
I should win because I've never been to either, love the view from the Hancock, and sure I would from the Space Needle! I've always wanted to see the Bears play live, TV is just not the same; and Seattle is on my list of places to visit and soon!
I grew up in Chicago, getting my football roots with the Bears during SuperBowl Shuffle '85. But I live in and love Seattle now so I would be elated to see my Seahawks take on my hometown team! 
I should win tickets to the Hawks vs. Bears game on Sunday because I LOVE the Seahawks and I love the Windy City! I have family in Chicago who are die hard Bears fans, and I'm born & raised in Seattle and love the Seahawks, so it would be a dream come true to watch both teams play at Soldier Field. 
I should win because my family has had a rough couple years and need a break. I would love to take my husband because he is a huge Seahawks fan and has never been to a game and it would mean so much to him. 
I LOVE the Seahawks, Seattle, and the Space Needle!!! It would be a one in a lifetime event I would love to share with my cousin!!!
Being a true Seattlite (born and raised), it's time for the Seahawks to take flight! If I can see only one Seahawks game, this would be it (plus I've never been to Chicago, that would be awesome!!!)!
I should win these because we have gone through some hard times lately and going to the play off game in our home city would give us so much hope! Also, I've never been to Seattle or anywhere near that part of the country - what a great experience that would be! 
We should win because our family comes together every weekend to watch the Seahawks games, we live in Bellevue, WA and our daughter is a senior at University of WA. She's graduating in June and needs a celebratory present like tickets to Seahawks/Bear game!
I should win because my brother loves the Bears, and I want witness the Hawks beating them, so I can rub my brothers nose in the tufts of fur that will litter the field! 
Born and raised a Chicagoan, the Bears are my childhood team - the Seahawks are my adult obsession! One of my biggest disappointments was that I was never able to watch the Bears at Soldier Field - now with the Seahawks! Dream come true!! Plus it would make the day of the closest thing I have to parents, who are in their 80's, if I could make it back to see them!
I'm from Seattle and love the Seahawks; my boyfriend is from Chicago and has watched the bears since he was a little kid. We need the trip to celebrate how great both teams are and break the silent treatment that is occurring at our place!
I SHOULD win because I would give the tickets to my brother, a die hard Seahawks fan, who seems to never get ahead in life and I know that this would be one of the highlights of his life. It means that much to me that I am posting on Facebook in hopes to win these impossible tickets, just to see my brother happy for a day.
I should win because, I am a huge fan and have been to every Seahawks and Husky Football game for the last three years (and almost every Mariners game). Thing is I have never been able to sit down and enjoy a game because I am a concession stand manager for Ivar's at Qwest, Safeco and Husky Stadium.
I think I should win because I have never been to a football game this in Washington before because I am a disabled vet (Thanks to my tour in the middle east) and money is tight for us. This would bring my wife such grate joy. She is my care giver anddoes not have any fun in her life because she has to take care of me. This would make us both really happy. Thank you for your time. And even if we don't win it is an honor just being able to run for it. Thank you!
I should win because I serve the 12th man in Seattle EVERY game, and have done so happily for 7 seasons! I should win because I have NEVER done a road trip, & this would be a GREAT way to celebrate my b-day & cross this off my bucket list! 
I should win because I am a huge fan of the Seahawks but I live in Oregon and can only afford to see them once a year. Representing the Seahawks in a huge playoff game along with taking in the sights of Chicago where I have never been would be priceless along with it being an early 20th anniversary for my wife and I!
I should win because I've lived in Seattle my whole life, love the Seahawks (not to mention the Seagals), and I also LOVE the Space Needle! I also think John Hancock was the man and I NEVER doubted Hasselback EVEN though his sister is a nutjob!
 I would love to win, because I am a Bears fan and have never been to a live game. What better way to go!!
I KNOW I should win because I've been a season ticket holder for MANY years but usually donate them to wounded warriors, or those military on leave. I had a ticket to the "Big Game" but ended up deployed so watched it in Afghanistan with about 30 Steal-er "fans" (all of us armed!)
Huge Football fans that has never been to a live NFL football game. Love Sky City, are frequent visitors and my husband is a totally disabled Iraq Vet whose spirits would really be lifted to attend a live game as well as never been to Chicago. 
I love Chicago and the Bears but have never been to a game. This would make a great weekend!!!!
It sounds like a nice weekend getaway. To see the Bears game and a nice dinner out along with a stay at the Essex Inn. I could use a weekend getaway like this. Nice way to start out the New Year.
I would love to win and be able to visit one of the storied franchises in all of football. I am a Seahawks fan with the 12th man swager... Give me a shot and let me loose my voice during the game and my heart in the great midwest that I once called home! 
I work in the tourism industry, promoting & supporting our teams all year 'round - win or lose! I would LOVE the opportunity to bring that show of support to Chicago, and would represent Seattle in a positive and motivating manner :)
I would love to take my daughter to her first Seahawks game and prove its okay to stand up for what you believe in, even when surrounded by Bears. Any chance youll include airfare too?
I would love to win because as a season ticket holder I sacrificed going to the home games at Qwest Field back in late Nov., my precious cocker spaniel who is diagnosed with splenic cancer started getting sicker, I decided to stay home to be near her. It was between the Seahawks & "Pebbles"...I chose Pebbles!!! :)
I would love to go to the game in Chicago since I have never been there but have heard the view from the John Hancock Observatory is as amazing as it is from the Space Needle in Seattle. Also I LOVE the HAWKS and would love to see them beat the Bears! GO SEATTLE!
I would love to win because I am a HUGE football fan, but a BIGGER BEARS FAN!!! It's in my blood, but I've NEVER been to a playoff game!!! 
I would love to win because I am a huge bears fan, I stick with them no matter what. Also, It is my dream to go to a playoff game:)
I would love to win these tickets because I would love to be able to go to an NFL game, ESPECIALLY the Superbowl! Also my boyfriend is a huge Seahawks fan and he definitely deserves it!
I'd rather watch the game on my Big Screen, but if you choose me, I'll suffer in the stands with the real fans!
Pick me!! I'm a teacher and big Seahawks fan; plus, my 27th birthday is coming up on February 3rd, and what a way to celebrate my birthday a bit early this year!
We are die hard Seahawks fans and now live in Virginia. We have never seen a game live and I would love for my husband to experience this with our daughter. he does so much for us and really deserves it. Go Hawks!!!!!
I should win because I'm a Chicagoan who loves da Bears (though I've never seen them), I have a trip planned to Seattle, and I basically never get out because I'm always on baby duty for my newborn. It took me 12 minutes to type this because I had to tend to her a dozen times since I started...PLEASE!
 I would love to be in the city just to get away. I would love to take a special person with me that has never been to a game. 
 I am no more or less deserving than anyone else who has posted and boy would it be the highlight of my dear husband's football fanatical life! This is a game not to be missed in a city almost as great as Seattle
I have never been to a football game and my 7 year old would love to go. I would like to take my family also, we love Chicago but hate the weather.
I've lived in Seattle my whole life and have been a seahawks since before I can remember, and I'm hands down capable of clapping and screaming louder than anyone else I know, I'd show soldier field what the 12th man is all about. And I have a very confused friend that is a die hard bears fan for some reason that I'd love to terrorize for the 2nd time this season!!!!
If you think you are beaten, you are. If you think dare not, you don't. If you like to win but think you can't, it is almost certain you won't. If you think you'll lose, your lost because out in the world we find....success begins in the fellows will....it is all in the state of mind. Life's battles don't always go, to the stronger or faster man. But the man who wins...in the end...is the man who thinks he can!
There are many good Seahawk fans and my son Matt is one of the best. His loyality has put him in some precarious places but he wins the opposing teams over with his likeable character and he is a one-man EARTHQUAKE!!!
I should win because, I am not a fair weather fan, I love our Seahawks when they win and when they lose. I'm good luck for a game, I've only been able to go to one game in 1986 and the Seahawks shut out the Steelers 30-0.
I don't personally know anyone who has had more faith in our Seahawks than my husband. To share this experience with him would be fantastic.
i should win because: 1) last feb my stepdad was killed and this would be a great way to memorialize his passing. 2) i really want to win and have never been to a game in my life.
I used to live in Chi-town right on Madison~! I LOVE LOVE LOVE it there, now I live in Seattle, these are MY TEAMS!!!! I would love to revisit my beloved city and root for the best teams in the NFL~!!! WOOOOO~!!!
I hope to win because I have NEVER been to a Bears game as tickets are normally sold out within minutes of going on sale.....winning these would be a dream come true! I also want to win these tickets to see the Bears knock those Seahawks back down to the ground and reality!
My wife and I have never been to a playoff game. It would be great to take her to see the only two teams she likes in the NFL!

HIya i was just wondering if u can buy canidae in the uk ?
We switched our Rott to the grain free about 2 months ago - he eats it like crazy and had REALLY REALLY bad gas! Will it ever stop!
Trying to find a dealer near zip 11563. I can find limited dry at Pet Supplies Plus in Valley Stream, but pickins are slim! Thanks
After all the vet recommended foods I have given my 7 year old kitty for skin allergies, none of them helped. Canidae appears to help. She has no more hot spots after 6.5 years of them. 
I feed my service dog Canidae and her coat is show shinny and helathy and she herself is healthy too! She has a sensitive stomach and Canidae is the only food I tried that worked. Sophie (my dog) thanks you for providing such high quality food! 
A special thank you to Feed Barn for adding the CANIDAE logo to their street sign. Visit Feed Barn in Costa Mesa, CA at 2300 Newport Blvd and tell them their friends at CANIDAE sent you! They have great customer service and can be reached at (949) 548-3151.
Hi their My name is Dude - I'm a 4 pound - 10 1/2 week old Rat Terrier pup that started on your lamb & rice, I was fed nutro and so was mamma before I got picked him up. but (at 8weeks) we switched and for the last couple of days he's had Very Very Very soft stools. He has clean ...bill of health from vet as along with sibblings. I'm afraid he and the food dont get along and I bought a 15 pound bag ;-( Any ideas ??
Since Canidae makes grain free food, are you going to make any snap treats that are also grain free? 
Team Ton80 is proud to introudcue Buehrle!! He is the newest member of the team and has started of very well!! He went to his first UKC conformation show and finished his Champion title in 3 shows!!

Team Ton80 does it again!!!!! Buehrle is on a ROLL!!!!!!!!

I have switched my cocker spaniel over to Canidae recently (he is now finally on all Canidae after the gradual change by mixing his prior food with the Canidae). I bought the Grain Free All Life Stage but I am a bit confused-has this product been changed? I have a bag that does not have the beach on it. Is that just new packaging but the same food? If I wanted to change him from that one to Pure Land should I do the gradual change as well or because it is the same 'brand' can I skip that process? Thanks!
Having a problem.... I had my dog on ALS grain free and when the formulas changed I had thought about switching to the single grain. No Pets Supplies Plus near me knows what I am talking about with the single grain and have no indication when they will get it. So the question is....for those of you feeding the ALS grain free, what did you switch your dogs too? I really wish it would not have changed, it was nice to have finally found a food that worked for my dog. 
I love this food. I can see a big difference in my two labs. One is 11 yrs old and he is feeling better and playing around more and my other lab hair is feeling so sofe, not so oily as before. I love knowing about this food, I got this for my cat too. 
my golden retriver puppy is having all life stage 4 in 1 ( fish turkey chicken lamb) ... any advise for me ? .. or i should change to another 1 ? 
We are in the process right now of switching our whole kennel over to the All life stage formula. We do alot of different things with our dogs from showing to weight pulling. We have 6 American bulldogs. I love hearing all the comments for people. I believe I have made the right choice on what formula to feed does anyone have any other suggestions?

As a semi regular customer of your Richmond branch, I went in with my mother yesterday and I have to say the food was as ever FAB and the staff were friendly with customers I have to say that it seemed rather more fraught and disorganized than usual. They had run out of diet coke, chips, apple juice, sparkling water and the ingredients for majority of the smoothies including the giddy giraffe which I had been looking forward to all morning. The team also seemed to be bickering amongst themselves with one of the managers (as far as I can ascertain senior staff wear 'civvies' and the rest of the team giraffe t-shirts) telling a waitress off in full view of the restaurant on mote than 1 occassion. While this one experience will not affect my future custom I have to say we left feeling somewhat disappointed in our lunch experience yesterday.
Had a brilliant meal on Saturday night with our 7 month and 2 year old. It was the first time we'd braved a restaurant!! The staff at Milton Keynes were brilliant, couldn't have done more - rushed through our 2 year olds order quick as a flash, entertained the kids where they could and generally looked after us. Food was great and my wife enjoyed a cracking Mojito! Thoroughly recommended! Thanks to all.
Big fans of giraffe coffee in this office....
Just had lunch today with the meal deal of 8.45 per person...that includes a starter and main...I had the vegetarian option... and it was fabulous...remember it starts from 4pm till 7pm... Bargain!
Mike in your Spinningfields branch in Manchester is awesome. He's super funny. Thumbs up!
I went to Giraffe in Norwich on thursday and had a delicious meal, I really couldn't fault the food or the service, however... I was disappointed to see automatic gratuity added to the bill, I would have left a tip for the waitress as we really did enjoy our meal, in fact my tip would have been more than the automatic one. I just feel gratuity should be dependant on quality of food and service and optional :)

Think I'll be making nutroll today. I'm a few weeks late, but the holidays got away from me. Plus, there's never a bad time for nutroll, right?!
Shocking confession that I need to get off my chest: I don't really like Nutella.
The nut roll recipe experiment last week was a huge success. Best ever!
Cupcakes with a twist - pastry cream on top instead of frosting. Totally delicious.
Ringing in 2011...

Popcorn popped in bacon oil. And mixed with maple-coated bacon. 
Easy, creamy homemade mac n' cheese. Ultimate comfort food!
Trying to decide on something to make for the blog today, and I'm indecisive. Help me out. Something sweet or a savory appetizer?
Who's ready for the big game?! Less than 2 weeks and counting!
4 years ago today, I was cooking Clouds in the Sunset, my kid-friendly name for this colorful soup:
2 years ago today, I was steaming this Nigerian Black-eyed Pea Cake. It's unusual flavor is not for everyone, but if you're adventurous, give it a try.
Have you tried roasted radishes? A year ago today I discovered that I love them, though this dish didn't make my favorites list:
If it's too cold to enjoy salad, try grilling your lettuce in the warmth of your kitchen. Here's how, in a post from 2 years ago:
One of my Yahoogroup members just shared this incredible deal on a Vitamix, the best price I've seen! (It's through QVC, not through Vitamix, so I get no commission if you buy. Just thought some of you might want to know.)
5 years ago today, I was making salads (yes, in January!)
Hard to believe it's been 4 years since I posted this, my blog's most popular salad dressing:
I'm cooking spaghetti squash and looking over my old recipes for it. This one was so good, but I haven't made it since. If you've made it, please leave a comment on the blog telling how it came out. All the old comments were lost when the blog was moved.
I somehow missed (by 2 days) the 3rd anniversary of this recipe for Golden Spice Pancakes, one of my favorites: 
I'm packing up to go stay with my mother, who just had surgery, for the weekend, so if I don't respond to your emails, tweets, or comments, that's why. I'll check in when I get back.
5 years ago today: This crockpot stew was one of my first blog posts, when I was cooking other people's recipes & linking to them:
I'm working on a new post; meanwhile, enjoy this spicy burger recipe from 2007, one of my favorites:
Jan. 17 seems to be an important day for my blog. Here's another of my all-time faves that was posted on 1/17/2008:
Happy 2011! My blogging resolutions are to cook more often, blog more frequently, and finally finish writing the cookbook y'all keep asking for. What are your resolutions?
It's hard to believe that it was 3 years ago that I first saw my photos in print (in Nava Atlas' great book). I'm still bragging about it! Now I'm looking forward to the release of our (opps, I mean HER) next book Vegan Holiday Kitchen and also working on the photos for her NEXT next book on greens. 
Why soups are great for dieting + links to 5 of my favorites, including my ridiculously easy Dirty Little Secret Soup:
These cookies are not just for Mardi Gras. Make them with or without gluten or pecans and decorate them any way you want. Add some red icing for Valentine's Day! Without pecans, only 52 calories each and less than a gram of fat.
This quick apple dessert also makes a great breakfast. Sprinkle with a little granola after cooking for an interesting crunch.
Here's a VERY green soup that I posted 4 years ago. It's amazing how much nutrition you can pack into 1 bowl! It may not look like much, but it tastes delicious.
I don't use millet enough. In 2006, I combined it with cauliflower and mushrooms in this Molly Katzen-inspired casserole.
Here's an old favorite pasta dish, a great way to use eggplant and zucchini when they're in season:
Think cabbage and peas are boring? You'll change your mind after tasting this cumin & mustardseed-spiced side dish from 2009.
This quinoa "paella," posted on this day in 2007, is one of my favorite dishes:
Hey Frontier, let's talk. 46% rates increases in the Oregon and Washington area? My prediction? You won't be in this market for much longer as your customer base will run to the competitors.
Could someone please tell what the problem is with the Internet service in Clay County, West Virginia. We've been having problems since December 23. Any info would help?
Who can I contact regarding internet issues in Tyler County, WV? We called with complaints to tech support on November 28, 2010 and have had absolutely no resolution at all. We have been told work order tickets have been issued with no word back whatsoever, I was even told after several calls to be home from 2-6pm on December 30th and no one called or showed up. I called yesterday and got no info, called today and got disconnected waiting for info, called again a few minutes ago to be told the status was "pending" and they were "working on it". I'm ready to file an FCC complaint if I can't get help or info......
Does anyone have an update on the Frontier router in Marlinton, WV? It is the source of packetloss and latency for many DSL customers in the Pocohontas and Greenbrier County area. We've sent numerous emails, calls, and opened tickets, with no response from our General Manager Reta Griffith. We would appreciate some information and customer service.
Friends and fellow potential Frontier Communications Customers: Anyone interested in FREE Direct TV for 2011, a FREE 15" HP Laptop, or possibly a FREE 32" HD TV with a BLUE RAY DVD PLAYER? If interested send me a message and I will get you the information!
Your customer service is a joke!!! I called earlier this week to schedule a move of my service and took the day off to be ready for the 8a to 5p install window you gave me (seriously?). Only to find out that my order was sitting in a shadow queue and not actually input into the system. So now I am wasting a day off!! Not to mention every time I call you I have to go through the whole "I can't find your account..." I have asked that my account be updated with my number at least the last 5 times I called and it still hasn't been done!! Good thing Comcast sucks or I would leave Fios!!
Okay, after today I am doing the unthinkable...I am going back to ComTrash! You guys should sell your service to a company committed to customer service. After you guys messed my order up, I sat around all day until 4p waiting for you guys to show up only to find out that the line never got pulled to the house. So now a whole weekend with no tv or Internet. Oh by the way I gave my number to your agents twice today and it still never got updated!
so I had no dial tone since Monday nite. I have called frontier 3 times, 1st time was told there was a fire and there was an outrage in my area and to call back later for a restoration time, called back 2 hours later, told there was no fire, and that according to dispatch there was no issues in my area, found that 1st trouble ticket had closed, opened up second trouble ticket, and was told to check back in the morning. Called this morning and found that 2nd trouble ticket was closed, but I still don't have a dial tone. Rep doesn't why second trouble ticket was closed. Am wasting all my cell minutes on hold, and since we have no dial tone our alarm system in our house is not working. This is very annoying, especially since we just ordered DSL a few days ago...
The ONLY reason why I "liked" this was to let people know how bad the actual DSL service has been. Intermittent service, if it even it worked at all, for over 6 mo. Their tech support is good, though. Always very nice and we always seemed to get along well. Computer literacy breaks that barrier. In my case, the billing was always correct. I had to bite the bullet and make the switch to (I hate to say it) Comcast (even though I dislike the company as a whole), at least their service is reliable. If you get the intermittent service resolved, I'll gladly come back. Wheeling, WV.
I will soon be switching back to COMCAST, the only reason I switched a few years ago was because we had Verizon internet and phone service and it reduced the price. Frontier's announcement that they are raising FIOS TV rates will make their prices considerably higher than COMCAST, but they will also lose the core business they are most interested in....my phone and internet service. So long Frontier, you don't care and I don't either.
Is there a place on the Frontier site to view my current usage? I've seen other people do it, however all I can find is this... Dialup Usage Month Total Usage January 2011 20477 minutes (341.3 hours) December 2010 43647 minutes (727.5 hours) November 2010 36085 minutes (601.4 hours) October 2010 34252 minutes (570.9 hours) I haven't had dialup in years...
If anyone is thinking of getting Frontier check this out. I changed to SureWest because I got the threatening letter saying I used too much internet and my monthly was going to go up to $250. So much for a price guaranteed contract. Because I ported the phone over Frontier canceled me with 2 months (@ $80 a month) remaining on my contract. I never canceled. I just got a bill for $679 with $700 in early termination fees. Luckily when I called about the disconnect (Frontier's doing not mine) they said $200 was the early termination. I'm taking tomorrow off just for phone calls to the Public Utilities Consumer Affairs Dept, my lawyer and anyone that will listen (check out stopthecap.com)
So First Frontier purchases Verizon in Fort Wayne Indiana. Now they're trying to railroad everyone to direct tv because they cannot support the FIOS infrastructure! Charging $50/month more to keep FIOS or get Direct TV free for the next year. I am beyond HATING this company. While I've been contemplating switching to direct tv right now even Comcast would be a better option than Frontier.
it's sad that this page is more of a complaint page, does anyone have anything good to say about Frontier? I do, I've called a few times lately because although staying with Frontier I'm switching my Fios tv to Directv. Frontier's customer service has been over the top! If I needed to be put on hold, they kept coming back and updating me so I knew they were still working on my account. And all the reps took the time to talk to me, no one seemed rushed and I didn't feel any sales pressure. This is a huge change from VZ. As a customer of Frontier, I think the change from Verizon is so far so great.
As a former Fiber Network Field Technician for Verizon, who enjoyed the one on one contact with customers, I would like to offer my services to you in your Fiber to the prem locations in Washington or Oregon. I have friends that transfered from Vz last year and would love to join them. Ive applied on line, but havent heard from you yet. I had been in Fios since the roll out in 2004, so im sure i could help you in servicing this great product. Thanks!
I don't understand the price increase and current contracts, does the increase start now or does Frontier honor the contract you currently have and wait to hit you with the increase after your contract is up? Also, will Frontier let you out of your contract if they are in fact not honoring the terms of it (and nullifying it)???
This DSL sucks. Had it for 7 years and as they added more homes in the neighborhood its gotten slower and slower. I'm on the max speed for my address and its slower now than my 14400 dial up modem back in 1994. I even bought a new pc just this week thinking the other was too old. A local tech told me my area was at the "end of the line" and it really couldn't be any faster. Perhaps you should upgrade in our area. After all this I'm switching to comcast cable internet instead.
We have been in contact with Frontier, and have filed trouble tickets for months. Meanwhile, my family is being billed for Max 3Meg service and receiving 0.3Megs and 5% packetloss through the Marlinton, WV router. Our requests for refunds have gone unanswered and we have not been given any updates after the timeframe for a promised fix has passed. We've tried to be patient, documenting and reporting the issues. I'm afraid the legal route and the FCC are becoming our only recourse. I've passed our documentation on to the WV PSC. While not regulating DSL specifically, they are helpful at making a report of the issue and giving guidance on how to get a filing to the FCC. I appreciate hearing from folks in Pocohontas and Greenbrier counties who are paying for broadband services that are not being delivered. Stephanie, if you can get this escalated properly and get Frontier management to take this seriously, we would appreciate it. I hope we can all change this situation for the better.
How do we get on the "Do Not Call" List for our own telephone company? Frontier telemarketers keep calling us and about wanting to make sure we have the best package available. We've already gone through it once and we don't need Frontier to keep calling us every week about it.

LUNCH: Lean Cuisine Market Creations Mushroom Tortilloni, & Lemon Water. Too bad that they don't take the MC for the codes....I prefer the MC.
so i went to cook me some of these chicken rolls...when i pulled out the package, much to my surprise, i found this $1 bill inside the package with the rolls. i have never had this happen in my life!! so strange???? needless to say...i put it back in the box and did not open!
Am I miscuing on the code entry directions? In this case, the code inside one of the specially marked boxes--including a combo if numbers and digits--was rejected (dashes were included). Had a different eligible entree for lunch yesterday in a regular box--no code as was indicated on site directions.
The code on the inside of the box was not accepted and I entered it lots of times! What do I do? I did use the code on the inside!
the FREE lunch bag code does not work ... very disappointed 
Spaghetti meat sauce is good 
Holy mother of all things delicious.....I just tried your new Thai Style chicken spring rolls and I am in LOVE!!!!! It tastes like I'm being bad. Thank you SO much for making this! My new favorite. :)
Codes for lunch tote not accepted either. Locked out for the day. Very frustrating indeed...
My codes for the lunch tote were not accepted either...very frustrating. Any suggestions?
I also have received some codes that are coming up invalide and I did enter the dashes. Any other suggestions?
I am also having problems entering the codes. I did enter the dashes. The print is of poor quaility and not sure if the second character was a K or N entered both didn't like either one. 
Where exactly are the codes? I have codes on the ends of the boxes but nothing inside and the get started code did not accept it.
I have tried to enter the codes with a dash. That didn't work. Then used the dots in-between the numbers/letters instead of the dash. None of it worked. Very frustrating. 
What if there is no code on the inside of the box?
So glad I logged on. I was soooo frustrated thinking it was only me. Guess they were not ready for the response. I am unable to enter my free code from the supermarket and have opened 3 new boxes and can't find any codes. 4 more boxes to go, but I have a feeling the situation will be the same. Hope Lean Cuisine has a response!!!!
I registered, and it took me to something called e-Prize? I put in the email address and password as the log in(because it was saying I needed to log in), and it said "login fail". I have a large number of LeanCuisine meals, and these bags look really nice. Now, if only I could actually be able to log in to put in codes and get one? 
I've now opened 5 Lean Cuisines and no codes on any of them. hmmmmmmm. 
Oh I love Lean Cuisine steamers!! I have lost 26 lbs. Hey ya'll should search "B Bar 2 Ranch Handmade Items" and like my page! Plenty of cost-friendly girly items with low shipping. Best way for a business to get started is word of mouth!
I *heart* the new LC bags, however....20 LC's....let's say that they're $2 or so a piece...minimum spent is $40 for a lunchbag?! Yikes!! I love LC's...but I don't know if I could do it!
I bought 10 lean cuisine and not one of them had a code in it.....am I looking in the right place?
My favorite Lean Cuisine is the Chicken Fried Rice. Yum!
I received a free code coupon from my grocery store and even THAT came up invalid. I can not find one box with a code on it!
I have a dinner entree box with a code but no matter how I enter it, it keeps saying code invalid???
Go to the bottom of their page to F&Qs. Open and scroll down. Fill out the form with your code and the problem, and supposedly Customer Service will get back to you within three days.
loving my sesame stiry fry chicken! With a 3 month old baby boy, I was in desperate need for easy, quick, healthy lunches. I've tried a few other brands, but Lean Cuisine has been the best by far! And I'm probably eating healthier than I would if I had two free hands to make lunch! Thanks LC!
just had the santa fe spring rolls ...YUM! with a bit of fire roasted salsa...fabulous....not bad for 20 grams of carbs...that is as high as i will go...!
Just bought 4 meals and not one had a code for the bag....what gives?
This is the hardest Promo ever had to research to find the code then find not all boxes have them....Too much work.......
ok so I got a login account ane entered 3 codes, the next day I went to enter another code but now when I sign on it tells me I have "0" codes entered?? Did those 4 codes go through and does Lean Cuisine have them or am I better off entering all 20 codes at once? It seems as if the 1st 4 codes I entered or not there anymore??
Entered 4 codes but when I sign on I sign on it shows ZERO in that bag
I have 12 boxes of Lean Cuisine and not one code. What is up with this?????
Am eating the Thai Spring Rolls as I speak- AMAZING! But a couple things I find weird. 1. 2 servings per box so you need to reseal and refreeze the box. 2. No dipping sauce. 3. No side dish. Yes, I know you're supposed to round out meals w/ fruits and veggies, but in addition to that an ethnic side dish would be REALLY nice. Oh yeah... 4. TOO HIGH IN SODIUM!
I opened 6 boxes and NO code. Bait and switch here?
3 meat pizza super delish!!!!
I love your quesadillass..
chicken club love it
Butternut Squash Ravioli - the BEST!
I have bought 4 meals in the past two days at two different stores and no codes? Where are they located inside the box?
Market creation chicken poblano is fabulous...makes dieting MUCH more pleasant.
Butternut Squash Ravioli ... I love it.... I can eat it everyday !!!!
Love the food, especially Sesame Chicken! A little disappointed with this whole lunch bag code thing. 3 boxes, none have codes. I did what you said the other day and e-mailed via "contact us", it's been 2 days and I still haven't heard anything? 
My codes keep disappering from my account---what gives??? I have e-mailed customer service twice and still no response....HELP!!!!!!!!!!!
Glazed chicken, chicken carbonara are the best!!!
I just had the roasted turkey breast they are so good, I liked it so much had to have another one, some of your meals are so good. It makes it easy to pick what to eat for lunch.
I have brought quite a few thinking dey all have codes. Outta da 14 I have eaten 5 & only came up wit 2 codes. What gives????
I also am not finding codes on a few of my boxes. 
Purchased Simple Favorites Cheese Ravioli yesterday, NO CODE. Jerks.
I too purchased two that didn't have codes in them. I guess I'll just have to stick to the few dinners that have the advertisement on them to get my codes.
Had the Garlic Chicken Spring Rolls today. Really good, but this is the first Garlic Chicken meal I've ever had that didn't have enough garlic. They also had the same downfalls as the Thai Spring Rolls- 1. 2 servings per box so you need to reseal and refreeze the box. 2. No dipping sauce. 3. No side dish. Yes, I know you're supposed to round out meals w/ fruits and veggies, but in addition to that an ethnic side dish would be REALLY nice. Oh yeah... 4. TOO HIGH IN SODIUM! 
Love Lean Cuisine but I am like a lot of others who don't have codes in all boxes. Appreciate the reminder that the codes are inside but I've only had 1 out of 7 have one-and just bought them at the start of the week. They aren't Market Creations.I emailed via the contact us a few days ago and still haven't heard anything. 
there are NO CODES in the boxes. 
"All LEAN CUISINE products except for LEAN CUISINE Market Creations contain codes." Really? ...Because i would like all of my codes please.... =(
Bought my Lean Cuisine today and opened the box looking for the code and Voila - not there. There are several numbers on the outside along side the expiration date, will these numbers do??? 
No codes and can't log in to enter
Are these codes printed in invisible ink? I don't see any on the inside of any of the participating items I've purchased...
Maybe you should try a black light to find the codes...it may be written in special ink! LOL Or how about swabbing them with some sort of chemical? They might appear magically!
So far my 3 boxes have not had codes. When I've contact LC via their website I get generic emails telling me a 13 digit code in red. No red codes and no codes with 13 digits. Also they said they are having technical problems with website and to wait 24 hrs before putting in code (where I get those not sure). So far not impressed at all with this promo. 
The Sesame chicken meal was very good.
I bought 24 lean cuisines and open the ends of the boxes to see the codes. Half my boxes did not have codes. The other half had a picture of the lunch bag in the bottom right corner of the front of the box (didn't notice that when I bought them) Those definitely have a code that is hard to see in that red ink but it also has a black printed line under it that says "To learn more about this code go to leancuisine.com" I found only one other code on the boxes with no lunch bag on the front. It's very hard to decide it you are reading a letter or number on some of the codes and when I tried to enter some, I got repeated error messages. Lots of problems with this promo but I'm not giving up because the bags are adorable and I eat lots of lean cuisine.
With LEAN CUISINE, you can banish the word "code" from your vocabulary, enjoy squinting into a box looking for numbers that aren't there, and relish in the enjoyment of every customer service call not returned. Seriously. I haven't even looked for my codes yet, but this wall makes me want to give up before I start. Where's the apology from the company about how this promo is being run? Who's getting fired for not doing their job? This doesn't really make me feel good about your company. 
I stocked up on Lean Cuisine but evidently they do not know there is supposed to be a code inside the box. I am not happy. I have bags too but I understand they do not have codes.
so far I am not liking this promotion. I went and bought 20 boxes from the supermarket. hmm opened them-no codes. Called store and of course they dont know what I am talking about. I bought them after January 1st so why are there no codes.Registered on website and when I go to sign in it gives me an error. This is very frustrating already. 
Registered for this promotion and I actually successfully entered one code form a box! Then the next box I attempted to enter wouldn't work. Decided I'd try it again later and now it won't even let me log in. It keep saying "error" as others have mentioned. I think one problem with the codes is that the numbers and letters are hard to decifer. They are in a computer looking type font that makes a D look like it could be a O or a 0, and a K look like an H. So who knows whether I'm typing it in right. I also got a box that did not have a code. On an positive note, the panini was very good!
Okay, so it's not just me getting the ERROR. I will check back later to see if the kinks are worked out. 
Ditto to most comments below- can't log in (getting an error message), the code I did get didn't work and most of the boxes I bought did NOT have codes in them. 
I've now had 3 boxes without codes, 6 non-working codes (which are getting better), and 2 codes that worked but didn't get put into my acct. This is a mess! Plus I haven't heard back to any one the emails it told me to send. But I'll still try!
umm lean cuisine?? hello? Do you NOT see the complaints for 2 days no gettin to enter codes or even complain about the fact that more than 2/3's of ur products DONT have codes!!! Like anytime youre ready we are ready as well..have a safe day <3
Same here-error message when try to log in and I bought 14 boxes yesterday and only the new dishes had a note on them about the code inside and about the lunch bag.
I keep getting an error code when I try to log in. Last tried two minutes ago.
I keep getting an error message, too, when I try to enter the coeds? Can someone please help??
I was able to log in the other day and registered one code. Today, I could log into the LC site, but then it wanted me to log in again for the code page. Also, this is the first entree I've used from my purchase last night (I bought 7 items) and it doesn't have a code. I sent an e-mail, but based on the comments below am not too confident about any responses.
Just had the Lean Cuisine Apple Cranberry Chicken for lunch. Very good, a bit sweet which helps when you feel the need for sugar. 
Can't register codes on leancuisine.com.... error....
Just had Lean Cuisine (Cafe Cuisine) Parmesan Crusted Fish with penne pasta for lunch!!! Yummy!!! And I love the pieces of zucchini in the sauce! : ) Thank you!
I have entered 3 codes over the past few days. I entered one the first day, it said I had one. I entered one the second day, it says I only have one, etc..Now today I can't even get logged in. Fix this website, please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I entered 5 codes in the first day and it said I had 5 codes. An hour later it said I had 0. So I tried to enter them in again and it said I can't enter them because they've already been entered. NOW it won't even let me log in! 
I bought 7 "cafe" and "spa" Lean Cuisine dinners on Tuesday and not one of them has the picture of the purse on the outside. Does that mean that they don't have the codes inside? 
Have been walking every day on my treadmill (new years resolution) and dining every day on Chicken Fettucini dinnertime...........my very favorite. Thanks!
Seems to work now. I got 2 codes added to my account 2 min ago. Thanks LC!
If your on the Kansas City Mo area Price Chopper has Lean Cuisine meals on sale for $1.49. I stocked up big time!!!! :)
I bought 20 lean cuisine meals there is a proof of purchace number but no codes inside!!!
I LOVE Lean Cuisine. Today I had your chicken parmesan. I thought I would check out your facebook page and I am highly disappointed with all the "fans" complaining about this free lunch bag deal and problems with the website. Honestly people, when you hear FREE, what do you expect? Learn to not sweat the small stuff. Kinda makes it seem like these "fans" of yours are just buying your product in order to get something free. :(
Ok so far I have entered 6 codes :)......so far so good!
I was able to post two codes just now. Evidently they fixed the problem.
20 boxes opened = ZERO codes. Emails sent to customer service, ZERO instructions as to what to do with all these boxes. The number of lunch bags are limited... probably only available if you win the lottery of getting a code that you can enter online. I only bought 20 because of this promotion. Mission accomplished for Lean Cuisine marketing but done without ethics or integrity IMO.
ok can someone tell me WHICH code is THE code to use? I open my boxes and find like 2-3 codes on either end... can someone take a picture of which code to use?
Just to let you know, that Walmart accepts internet coupons, and do have the lean cuisine there, had no problem using my coupon. 
I don't like the steam bags or the lack of selection and price. I hope they don't get rid of the boxes and change to this. 
I have entered 16 codes already! tomorrow I will enter my last 4 and I will be able to order my bag:) yeeeeaaaayyyy Thanks Lean Cuisine
Enjoyed the new Thai-style chicken spring rolls today...tasty !!
Thank you for getting the website fixed so we can enter codes and have them count!
I like the garlic chicken. . onlyy 33 carbs and 3 sugars.. perfect for my diabetic diet
I'm still having problems putting the codes in; also, one package had no code. LC still has work to do
I just bought 12 new boxes and the 1st one doesn't have a code inside. I'm not having good luck so far with this!
I need another option rather than email for my issue with my boxes not having codes. it takes a week for them to respond and they aren't really acceptable responses. I have 20 boxes and so far 4 do not have codes. Emailing each LC Name UPC and timestamp is really an ridiculous request when you are looking at 20 boxes, I certainly shouldn't have to open all 20 to find out they have no codes in them and then can't return them if I end up not getting a bag (which is the main reason I purchased them in the first place)
still no luck submitting codes. very frustrating. not worth it. Healthy Choice is on sale as well. 3/$5 there are coupons $1 off 2, good deal
I JUST ORDERED MY LUNCH BAG.......MY NICOLE LUNCH BAG ITS IN ITS WAY YEEEEAAYY :)
The chicken BBQ quesadilla is my new favorite! i bought 10 yesterday!!
The pizzas are great! My favorites are the Margherita and the Spinach and Mushroom.
Trouble with codes again! My account showed 4 yesterday, now it shows one again. I entered a code today, now shows 2, should so 5!!!
I was so disappointed that NONE of my meals that I bought have codes inside of the boxes! Any suggestions? I'd really like a lunch bag. :)
I'm not finding any codes...
When I finally got a reply to my email this is what it said....Hello, Thank you for contacting us regarding the Lean Cuisine Red Carpet Collection Lunch Bag Offer. Your question is very important to us. We apologize for any inconvenience this matter may have caused you. However, please be aware that the 13 digit unique code can be found printed in red on the inside panel of the LEAN CUISINE package. If you are unable to locate a code, please reply with the name and type of the LEAN CUISINE product purchased, along with the UPC code and Timestamp (located next to the UPC code). Should you need any additional clarification, or have any other questions regarding this promotion, please do not hesitate to contact us directly. Thanks, Lean Cuisine Customer Service 
The codes are inside the box and very light colored. You have to include the dashes as well.
The only ones that are eligible have the ad on the box for the lunch bags, the older ones that are in the stores are not eligible, so basically I bought 20 dinners and have 2 that have codes! And the D's look like 0's and O's! finally got the code entered in caps...yikes!!!!
I bought 5 today @ Target! They were on sale @ $2.00 each! Buy 4 get 1 Free! I bought Sesame Chicken, Butternut Squash Ravioli since I wasn't sure which boxes had the codes inside & these had the lunch bag offer on them!
it wont take any of my codes it keeps telling me error getting a little upset here
Your meals just keep getting better. Can you make more panini varieties?
Was the Squash Ravioli discontinued?- because I can't find it anywhere. It was my favorite- as well as many of my friends.
I enjoy Lean Cuisine entres. Have been eating them for many years. Love the sesame chicken and the squash ravioli. Also love the shrimp and broccoli affredo and chicken broccoli alfredo. Portions are just enough for me. 
Having problems with codes! Some packages have no codes in them and one that does will not work!
I bought 12 boxes & out of the 12 only 3 had the code!! The Five Cheese Rigatoni was the only one with a code. The cheese ravioli, fettuccine Alfredo & Four Cheese Cannelloni didn't!!
having trouble inputting codes onto the website! On the link "get started and enter codes here" it opens a new window that says "internet explorer cannot display webpage" My internet connection is fine - or else I wouldn't be able to write this message? So is there a trick I am missing??
I purchased a few boxes over this past weekend and so far only opened one but NO CODE!!! Now what???
website is really having issues. i'm trying to update my profile and the page will not come up. says try later. also tried the free code and it says page cannot be displayed when i submit. thanks.
My FAVORITE LC is the Spinach, Artichoke & Chicken Panini! Yum Yum!
I want to know what happened to the breakfast sandwiches with egg and sausage that Walmart sold. It was the only place I could find them and they were really good. I also wish they would go easy on peppers in almost every dish. I really can't tolerate them. Onions on the other hand would be very welcome!
I had (luckily) only one code I entered last week. Now I go on and it says 0 codes? What's up with that - are they going to fix that or are the codes just lost?
I just opened one of my dinner pizza's & there was no code either. How do we get the missing codes from you ?? 
I had written about missing codes too. They sent back this "If you are unable to locate a code, please reply with the name and type of the LEAN CUISINE product purchased, along with the UPC code and Timestamp (located next to the UPC code)." I don't see a timestamp next to the UPC? What does it look like? Could you post a picture/instructions? Thanks
I just found out about the free code to get started collecting for that bag lol & then I read down the wall & see MANY complaints about the codes. I am now somewhat holding back on purchasing any Lean Cuisines. Is this gonna be worth the effort? I like Lean Cuisines tho & also wonder are they ok for diabetics? I dont plan on replacing regular meals with these but it sure would be handy in a pinch! 
got all of my codes entered, selected the bag i wanted. told me i would get an email.....nothing yet!
i love how i purchased 20 meals.. gone through 6 or seven && have only found one code :/
Love the new Lean Cuisine Creations --- but yes -- expensive -- and hard to find coupons and code's for discounts --- anyone have more info
Trying the new Fajita-style chicken spring rolls and man are they delicious!! Way to go!
I keep trying to enter my codes and I get an error message and I get shut out for the day. I try again the next day and it tells me that I cannot enter codes more then once, but they are not on my account. I Love LeanCusines, but this contest has caused me alot of frustration!
lean cuisine I contacted customer service a week ago about getting codes and got an email saying I would receive them and never did
does anyone know is the LEAN CUISINE pizza counts for the promotion - I bought one and followed the directions for the microwave - really soggy - disappointing - hope it counts for the lunch bag at least.. 
PLEASE HELP!!! so they responded to my email about the lean cuisine boxes with out codes && they said they wanted the name of the product, the catergory in which its from, the UPC code and the time stamp located next to the UPC code.. there is no time stamp next to the UPC code. along the side there are a whole bunch of numbers and the Best before date.. is the time stamp the one that looks like 14:49P7991?
Market Creations - Chicken Pot Stickers...YUMMY! I am not a veggie lover. I am not a health food guru. I prefer things that taste simple yet tasty. The Chicken Pot Stickers have lots of veggies to compliment the delicious pot stickers. Don't expect this product to be dry and tasteless...this is every bit as delicious as the pot stickers I have enjoyed in restaraunts for years. Thanks Lean Cuisine...I just might celebrate my 30th birthday under my goal weight thanks to you!
I enjoy starting my day off with a good workout, either Slim In 6, P90 Abs or Shakeology workouts sometimes even the treadmill. After I'm done I enjoy an awesome chocolate Shakeology protein shake. My freezer is stocked with Lean Cuisine dinners. I especially like the new steam in the bag meals! This is what motivates me in the early am through lunch to make it through a long day. What motivates you and what workouts do you like?
I purchased 14 boxes and not one had the code! I am so frustrated with this entire promotion. There was a banner at my local Pathmark advertising the free lunch totes, but none of the boxes had the codes. I emailed ALL the info to customer service and now just wait and wait. I am not buying any more until they make good on their offer!
Just had the Shrimp Scampi and Garlic Chicken Market Creations...delish and easy to prepare!
I bought 5 the other day and the one I opened did not have the code inside, can I use anything else?
Looks like I'm not the only one experiencing problems with the "no code" on the inside of the box! It's pretty awful - and makes me wonder just how old the product is in the freezer. I've had one code that worked and three that didn't. Still waiting for customer service to get back to me. I kind hate hanging on to old boxes. It's gross! THUMBS DOWN for Lean Cuisine and this promo. Should have been thought out a little better!
I bought 10 boxes only found 1 code and when i enter it wont work, wat's up with that 10boxes 1code.....hmmmmmm
I registered last week, and it STILL won't let me login & enter my codes! I emailed customer service & STILL no response! :-(
I've seen all the trouble people are having so I have now decided that I don't want a lunch bag that much to go through such a hassle--no matter how good the food is--my time is too important to waste, with my wedding in May, to be shopping for the correct packaging/numbers for a bag....
I called myself after finding at least five of no codes. At first the customer service person suggested maybe I couldn't read the box! Then she said that they only started sending out the products with codes in December. She looked up my items and they were shipped in September. then she basically said I was out of luck because I did not pick the right meals! They advertised all would be used except market creations. She did say I should save all my boxes and someone would call me. It has been a week and no call. I don't think they properly prepared for this.
So I stocked up on Lean Cuisine meals (I eat them for lunch @ work) last Sunday at the store. Not a SINGLE one has a code inside--and I checked to be sure they were the styles that were supposed to. Five days after emailing customer service I get the message about saving the UPC code and the time stamp. Well, I can't leave tons of empty Lean Cuisine boxes piled up on my desk at work. What a hassle & a rip off!!
Enjoying Chicken Tuscan for lunch. Can't help but think, though, that brown rice would have been better than the linguine. Just a suggestion.
I work at a car dealership and if I had to guess, I'd say that the same people that designed the Cash for Clunkers Program were hired to develop this lunch bag scheme :) I will still buy LC, but this is ridiculous for a lunch bag. I'm good with continuing to bring my lunch in my purse or a recycled plastic grocery bag!
It just keeps getting better. I sent them info for five boxes...and received one code. Awesome. What a rip off!
I love the three meat pizza, it is eazy to make when you are running out of time, I teach preschoolers at it great lunch item 
Third day in a row... another entree with NO code inside. Boooo
Thai Style Chicken Spring Rolls.....suprisingly delish. Good job LC!
How 'bout a nice old-school approach, LC? I like the idea someone had of sending in receipts. Just post a pdf of a form we can fill out and send in with them. Easy! Besides, I've already thrown out my boxes that didn't have codes. Don't do a promo like this until you've thought it through and you're tech-savvy enough to administer it properly.
I've been eating LCs for years without them giving me a lunch bag, and will continue to do so. I have another ten weeks to find all the codes I need. I can wait, and enjoy my lightweight dinners while I'm doing so. Thanks, LC!! <3
Where are the codes on the older boxes, I have too many to just waste.
Little frustrated no codes to be found in my box!!!
Just ordered my tote! Does anyone know how long shipping REALLY takes? (it says 8-12 weeks).
No codes and I want the tote! I have contacted customer service and no reply!! Not very happy right now!
Opened 3 more of the boxes I bought on Thursday and no codes. And no reply from customer service. What a waste of energy.
If you haven't tried the Thai-Style Chicken Spring Rolls, you don't know what you're missing!
Open a LC, no code for the lunch bag. Open another, no code. Another, no code. This is really frustrating since I just purchased them yesterday....
Does anyone know EXACTLY where the code/timestamp is located that LC is requesting for boxes without a lunch bag code? There are so many numbers and stamps on these things. Is it the one on the side flap that shows "proof of purchase" and then the numbers and date on the right side? or is it the UPC that the store scans? or the numbers on the inside flap? I've e-mailed 3 different boxes with ALL of those numbers, and keep getting an automated response stating to enter the time stamp, etc. does this e-mail come even if I gave the correct info? Thanks!! I <3 LC Meals!
I just bought a lean cuisine and there wasn't a code inside to use towards the free lunch tote :(
My last two boxes had codes but when I entered them (over and over again) I received a message saying they were entered incorrectly. I entered the dashes but does anyone know if they need to be entered in caps or how to tell if a zero is a zero or the letter "O"?
the sweet and sour chicken and spinach/mushroom pizza are awesome. this food is to live for!!! My suggestion is to come up with lite desserts and bars for snacks!
How do the meals compare with low-sodium soups? I am trying to save money and time during "lunch hour."
Another week goes by and still nothing about the credit for the packages with the UPC and timestamp codes I sent in. It really is not the consumers problem that LC has old product on the shelves at grocery stores. Maybe they should be more worried about old product the lunch bags. What a marketing nightmare.
Looks like I am not the only person totally frustrated with these boxes with no codes. So far I am 1 for 4. I have sent emails and the website says they will get back with you in three days. They did in six days and asked me to send the same info again. Get it together Lean Cuisine I'm tired of sending the same info over and over and no response.
Does anyone know where we send the UPC / date info too? 
I just stocked back up this weekend on LC and none of them have the LUNCHBAG logo so I am assuming I got 10 without codes .... ARGHHHHHHHHH 
Hey Lean Cuisine get your act together regarding the codes for the lunchbags promotion! You have a LOT of ticked off customers who are going to start buying OTHER products till you wake up and answer to us!
geez, why don't these people go out and buy a lunch bag instead of whining about not getting a free one
For everyone who has boxes w/o codes: before you choose one at the store, check out the dark grey strip on the right side of the box. if the expiration date is 12/2011 or later, you can be pretty sure that box has a code. if the date is 10/2011 or 11/2011 (or earlier) it means it's an older box, probably w/o a code. Lean Cuisine, I feel sorry for your CSRs right now. :o(
Why not have us mail in upc codes !
Just tried the Chicken Parmesan yesterday and it was soooooo good!!! And only 8 weight watchers points! Stocked up on a few them for lunch at work. I'm a huge fan and I can't wait to try the Chicken with lasagna tonight. Thank you Lean Cuisine for helping me lose 47 pounds so far!
I love the Mac and Cheese<3
I just bought a whole pile and there are NO codes in the boxes!!
I also bought some boxes and none of them have codes either.
I emailed LC 5 days ago about no codes and still have not gotten a reply, will hope for today!
Hey guys, i just started my diet and plan on eating these meals three times a day to tryn loose weight. any tips?
I can't find a code for the free bags on any of the six boxes I bought.
Eating the sweet & sour chicken with rice for lunch. What are you eating? #31days
No Codes in 12 boxes......I GIVE UP !!!!!
I just bought a pile of them and the codes were all inside the boxes. I know they were suppose to be in all after Jan. 1,2011??? My did have the lunch bag advertisements on the front though. Don't know if this helps anyone??
Well, a miracle occured today when I opened a box of LC and FOUND A CODE! I couldn't believe it. It's only the 2nd one out of 11 boxes that has had a code. I felt like I won the lottery...until I went to the LC website and found that the servers were not working. I should have known there was a catch. Silly me. Live and learn.
Look for the ones with the lunch boxes advertised on the front- those have the codes!
There wasn't any meals with the purses on the front at my store, honestly, I looked through them all...so i bought 16 others, since the page says they will give you a code in exchange for info from the boxes...I can't get one reply back with a code in exchange for info of the box information I've sent. i agree, I give up AND I feel like it was a scam! 
I just opened another box marked with the lunch tote on the front and no code! I have not had one meal with a code yet this month. 
After having worked for a fulfilment company handling customer service for promotions like this, I know how badly the best plan can go awry! On one promo, we staffed up and waited in anticipation for the calls to come in and 4 months later they finally started. The client company had greatly underestimated how much old product was still on the shelves and in distribution centers. In this case, I think that there was a whole lot more old product in the distribution chain than Nestle believed. I do have to admit that I believe that the timeliness of email response or lack of a response thus far is horrid. I'd be in BIG trouble if my team provided that level of service...
Thirtyone has insulated lunch bags, pesonalized, for $5.00, this month. Just saying, I have one, don't sell them, but they keep food hot or cold for 6 hrs. Lean cuisine boxes fit perfect in them.
Does anyone know if the Bacon Alfredo Pizza has been dicontinued????
I also don't have any codes and they were bought after January 1. Anyone know where to email or contact Lean Cuisine?
I eat lean cuisines every night for dinner. I buy like 30 a month. Have only had 4 boxes with codes. Sent in 4 emails to receive a code (used the correct information) and haven't gotten any codes, just auto-replies. Has anyone had success with the e-mails? Just wondering... I haven't seen many positive comments about the lunch bag :(
Did yo change the recipe for Butternut Squash Ravioli? It used to be good. Now the sauce is watery & bland.
If anyone is having trouble entering codes, I found that items that look like a capital letter O is really a D and same thing with H and N. The red dot matrix design was a pretty terrible idea, IMO. I live in the NYC area and have found only the ones with the purse on the front actually have the codes, regardless of the timestamp.
I already sent 2 emails about boxes without codes and no reply and this weekend I bought another 10 boxes and so far 3 of them with no codes WTF Lean Cuisine you are only making people buy that's all.
I just entered my 1st 2 codes.... And it all went well. I hope I don't start to run into the trouble that alot of you all have been dealing with...
I just sent a 3rd email regarding no codes. I really cannot believe a company such as Lean Cusine is handling this problem so poorly. None of my boxes with the lunch bag on the front have a code. Okay...they have a glitch in printing the codes..let's work on fixing it. But not one reply from LC. Why? 
I also sent them emails. Got a response to send in date and time printed on box. Nothing.....so I suppose I won't be seeing the 4 codes for the 4 I purchased without codes. I think we should get get some awesome coupons for wasting our time emailing them and typing out time and date stamps and then getting nothing in return. This whole thing is just stupid.
Oh Lean Cuisine...if there weren't enough reasons for me to love you, you create the most delicious Thai-style chicken spring rolls!
I entered a code I had printed on a grocery store coupon that promoted the lunch bag offer to get started last week. Just now I tried to enter a code inside a box. Not only would it not accept the code, it shows I have NO codes entered. 
Had Roasted Turkey Breast with Dressing and Cinnamon Apples for lunch! YUM!!!
I love Lean Cuisine....Had the Butternut Squash Ravioli yesterday and the Asian Style Beef and Broccoli today ....
Ha we have Lean Cuisine Bacon Alfredo pizza almost everynight and have not seen one code..
Just saw a commercial for Lean Cuisine which touted the fact that you used "farm-picked broccoli." Seriously? Is there any other kind? Bad writing...
I emailed about not having a code on the inside of the box on January 9th. It took til today to get a response back. They gave me a code to put in. Problem is.....I have 3 more boxes without codes. So, I emailed back again only to find out that I have to provide the timestamp too. So, it will take 10 days to hear back from them and then I'll have to submit the timestamp and then it'll probably be another 10 days before they send me the codes. ugh!
Lunch bag code question: I eat an average of one or two lean cuisines a day. All of which were bought after Jan 1st. I work at a grocery store and usually buy one everyday at lunch. I'd say in the past two weeks, I've eaten at least 20 meals, but I've only gotten three codes. Anyone else having these issues?
Seems like everyone is having trouble with the codes. Every time they have a O you can't tell if it is a one or zero. The codes are not well written inside the boxes.
I think everyone who has sent LC an e-mail should get a lunch bag. So we can all shut up and move on with our lives. I thought this would be fun but it's just a friggin pain in the arse!!! Thanks, Lean Cuisine!! 
I have had quite a few boxes with NO code. I just bought the boxes :(
I wrote to them and they told me to send the following information. The name of the item, the upc code and the numbers located on the gray strip under the ingredients. Not sure if I will get any satisfaction but it doesn't hurt to try. From now on I am only buying the boxes that advertise the lunch bags on the front. I have several in the freezer that don't but I still have lots of time to get 20 codes.
I have a Lean Cuisine every night for dinner. It keeps my portions and calories in check. And I love those lunch bags ~ very stylish. 
Spaghetti w/ Meat Sauce....awesome. I could eat it every day!
Hey Lean Cuisine- I cannot find this on the website at all or on the boxes about the promotion- but can one person order more than one lunch tote if they have enough codes? Let's say if I get 40 codes, can I order two? Thanks!
I eat them every day for lunch. They are tasty and low in calories! Their mashed potatoes actually taste like the real thing and not the fake ones. Thanks Lean Cuisine!
Still waiting on that reply from customer service. Sent all the info from my 14 boxes that were missing codes on Sunday and still no reply.
I haven't been able to find the Salmon and wildrice at any of the markets....any ideas? Help!
Contacted Cust Serv. this morning...Out of 9 boxes I purchased last week only 3 had the codes. Within 15 minutes I got an email asking for the timestamp and add'l info. Now hae to wait for them to contact me again. Hope it's not too long...
Saw that alot of people here stated the codes are only on boxes with the bag on the front and that's not true.. Out of 9 boxes I just bought only 3 boxes had have codes. 1 had the bag on the front and the other 2 didn't...Guess its just luck of you get the codes or not!
The bag promotion is a nightmare. Just opened my 4th box with no code, and it's been over a week with no response from customer service about the first box I opened. I give up on the offer... a free lunch bag isn't worth this much trouble. LC, you should send out free bags to everyone who even attempted to participate, or at least some coupons for free product.
I, too, have over 10 empty boxes sitting here and none of them have codes in them! No answer still from Customer Service! Help!!
Third box with no code inside. Hope this lunchbag promo is not a hoax. :(
tried Szechuan Stir Fry with Shrimp today- I tend to stay away from seafood in frozen dinners but this was good! The shrimp were not rubbery and the sauce had a little spice to it. ;)
I am more than a little underwhelmed by your customer service. I sent them all of the info they requested over a week ago and still no codes have been credited to my account. It is a huge waste of my time. And, by looking at your page, I see that I am not the only one who is frustrated. 
Just tried the Thai-style noodles w/ chicken. Very good, I'll buy it again.
Just had the Ziti.. DELICIOUS!
Beginning to think the free lunch bag offer is just a big scam to get us to buy more. All the stores have had them on sale so I've been stocking up. 8 out of the last 12 boxes I bought don't have codes. Customer service first replied with a somewhat cold form letter. I sent them the requested information over 2 days ago with no reply yet. And now the lunch bag website is down for maintenance. Thinking about reporting this to the BBB or the FTC.
just tried to input my codes - site is down for maintenance - may be as frustrating as everyone is saying - 
Even though the promotion posters say you can use boxes that do not have the free lunchbag ad on them sounds to be a big hassle. Make sure you buy meals that have the promotion logo on them and they will have codes inside. Would be nice to get credit for the meals I bought just before the promotion started... :(
I think it will be easier for me just to buy a $20 lunch bag instead of buying 20 Lean Cuisines. No responses to my emails, no codes in the boxes, no way to even enter the ONE code I have online since the website is down. Most annoying "freebie" ever...it's starting to look like a "bait and switch" scam. 
Site is down longer than it has been the lasst 2 days. That is my only complaint-the site is down. I am having no trouble finding my codes, or inputting them; I'd just like to be able to put them in when I want to instead of sitting with empty boxes out.
saw a post yesterday concerning the boxes with no codes....Lean Cuisine didn't count on so much product without codes would be still be on the shelves. i think we all have the same disappointments and aggrevation with the site. Oh well.....BUT I look forward to my lean cuisine everyday. I had the shrimp and broccoli today...it was good. 
Just came from my Pathmark store in Phila., PA and spoke to the manager there. I purchased 4 more LC's and I opened them there with the manager. Only 1 of the boxes had the code inside. He said they just got a new shipment in and that is what is now on the shelf. (they're on sale until tonight). He said I'd have to contact the company. They did have a display stickout out of the freezer doors advertising the free bags... Looks like LC's printing on these boxes is messed up...Now have 13 boxes and only 4 #'s total...
Does anyone know off hand if the Cafe Cuisine Beef Portabello is one that is included in the freebee bag deal...Site is down can't check the list..Thanks.
Wow, I just ready through the posts here. Lots of disappointed people. Hey, Lean Cuisine, you really should monitor your FaceBook page better that this. It's a sure way to lose customers, and I am a new one ...
Still down. I eat Lean Cuisine everyday for lunch and have only been able to enter two codes. Either the box doesn't have a code or the site is down. Frustrating!
Two days and counting... Tring to put in codes. Is there another way to enter them???
when is the maintenance going to be done on your site, I have codes to enter which make my 20 and cant enter them I am excited to order my bag.
When will the site be up so that I can enter my codes???????????????
Why are we not getting replies from customer service or Lean Cuisine with regard to this issue? If you ignore it, it's not going to just go away.
Timeline: 12/31 - signed up on website 1/2 - bought 20 meals 1/5 - send LC a message stating that all boxes opened thus far had no codes 1/7 - got form letter reply stating someone would review my message 1/12 - got personal reply asking for UPC code and timestamp, advised to save boxes 1/16 - gathered the 14 of 17 boxes having no code and replied by typing in a gazillion hard to read numbers 1/21 - took a look around kitchen littered with empty boxes, tried once more to access site and enter few actual codes, said screw it and ordered much cuter lunch bag with monogram, now off to store to purchase Smart Ones Lesson: while the food isn't bad the poor customer service left a bad taste in my mouth. Has ANYONE received a satisfactory reply in this promotion?
four cheese pizza . . . delicious!
Really Lean Cuisine? Tuesday when I tried to access the site it was down for about an hour. Same for Wednesday. Tried yesterday, and it is still down. Judging from all the posts here, you're about to lose a TON of consumers. Oh wait. It's not like you're actually goig to read this...
Had Tortilla Crusted Fish with Rice, Poblano Peppers & Corn in a Sour Cream Sauce for lunch. Yummy!!!
Geez ppl! Just be patient. I am sure they regret what has happened and will fix the problem as soon as they are able. I believe the fact that they don't reply to your complaints in re the lunch bag, is b/c they are very busy trying to address the problem and making sure this doesn't happen again.
Got my email today with codes!! So don't give up. They ARE sending them!!
Website to enter codes down again.
FINALLY!!!! I just got an e-mail with codes a half hr ago after not hearing back from them for almost 11 days!! I didn't have to give the UPC's or gray strip info. I kept calling them to get with the program and finally this morning the CS person said that she would talk to her Supervisor. Soooo, I punched in the codes that I was sent and I just ordered the 'Jessica' bag....sooo excited!!! Said it will arrive within 8-12 wks...let's see what happens...;)
Website is working!! Just entered my codes! : ) I knew they had to be working on it! : )
I'm officially in love with a Lean Cuisine product. Ok not literally in love but it is my favorite. The Garlic chicken springs roll are to die for. I absolutely love them. Thanks Lean Cuisine!
Just ordered my free lunch bag! They said after I ordered: If you've collected more than 20 codes, all remaining codes in your account will automatically roll over into Delicious Rewards, the upcoming loyalty program from LEAN CUISINE. It will debut in April, so please keep enjoying LEAN CUISINE and entering codes to earn even more rewards.
LEAN CUISINE ~ I need help!! Saw a post a week ago about what to do if you have boxes with no codes inside! I don't remember what it said?? Please help! Tryin to earn my free bag, but have at least 3 boxes with no codes....
I have boxes with no codes :( HELP! 
The allowable maximum number of codes one can enter per day is 12. My account was 7 and now I have 19. I was not able to enter the last one b/c I reached the max. allowed per day. Oh, I hope I can enter the last one tomorrow.
was disappointed to find out that after only entering one successful code, I had reached the limit of tries for the day...valid or not because I can't make out what one of the digits in the code is...it's either a 0,O,orD? Also, I didn't see anywhere in the instructions where they tell you that you have to enter the dashes too. What a waste of a code day. At this rate it will take me 20 days just to get in a valid code per day. lol
My boxes have no codes!! What's the best way to get in touch with Lean Cuisine about this? Has anyone had any help with this?
JUST SIGNED UP WITH MY FREE CODE FROM ALBERTSON...SO I'M ON MY WAY.
Not all of the boxes have codes. You need to look at the front right lower corner. It will say it has a code inside. It is a promotional on the new flavors.
Just entered a code and it said it's already been used. Not by me! This promotion is nothing but trouble
There is a list of participating products and it specifically says on the site now that the lunch bag offer is on all participating products purchased after 1/1/2011. If your box does not have a code, save it and follow the link/instructions on the site. They are trying to make good on the promo. Just follow the directions and have a little patience. Also, if your code has dashes, you do need to enter them.
I just got my JESSICA Rock'n'Roll lunch bag! Thank you Lean Cuisine. Keep saving those codes for future promotions.
contacted lean cuisine via their email at the lunch bag site.. OVER A WEEK AGO (said it would be three days) regarding boxes that have no codes (as they've instructed us to do). I NEVER heard back. Checked my spam folder and junk mail. Nothing. Nice going LC. 
Loving the Thai Style Chicken Spring Rolls & the Garlic Chicken Spring Rolls!!!!
LOVE those Mushroom tortellinis!
Just had Roasted Turkey Breast with Savory Herb Dressing and Cinnamon Apples for lunch! : ) Gonna pick up some spring rolls next trip to the grocery store since they are getting such a good rep on here!
Anyone want a free code for "The 2011 Red Carpet Collection"? Message me and be the first to comment
I love the new Lunch Bags, The Jessica is just "My Style" I just put in my code on-line so I'm on my way to geting my bag! You guys always have the best tasting foods and I STILL carry my lunch bag that a got a few years ago and people always ask about where I got it from!! :)
is very disappointed with the Free Lunch Bag Offer. My first box did not contain a code and I was promised one by e-mail when I notified them, but I've never received the code. I'm almost afraid to open another box and have to go through this again.
The code site works for me now.
so about two weeks ago i emailed them the information they asked for the boxes with no codes... STILL havent gotten any information back from them!!!!! this is agravating. i have had 10 boxes WITHOUT codes && NO response!
I was finally able to enter my final code. I chose "The Jessica" bag.
Just bought 10 more boxes and only 3 had codes. That leaves me so far 23 boxes with only 7 having codes. Sent info to LC on 6 of them over 1 week ago and still no replacement codes and just sent required info for remaining 10 today. Now I need 16 replacement codes... 
Thank you for finally sending me an e-mail with codes! Unfortunately I have at least 5 more that I need to request from you. I appreciate you guys keeping up with the e-mails. I'm sure you didn't expect the promo to end up a disaster like this! At least you know you have a lot of people loving your entrees! :)
I'm beginning to think that either this is a scam or a very poorly managed program. I have sent numerous emails via the link provided and have had no resolution at all. I love the food, but this promotion stinks!
Love the tortilla crusted fish, my fave!!!
My 4-year old son is having Swedish Meatballs and I'm having Apples-Cranberry Chicken. Both are our favorites. Best lunches on a cold snowy Monday!
i lik the sesame chicken
I sent an email on Jan 9th with code requests and got a response that they needed required inormation. I responded and no codes :(
Just ordered the Ashley bag.
I wish Lean Cuisine(and others) would use a soy sauce without wheat(its SOY sauce). It is the only thing keeping our family from buying more of your products. One of my family has a wheat allergy!!!
I am done looking for codes. None of my boxes have codes. I stil have not heard back from CS. Granted I would buy the meals anyway but I certainly would not have bought 20+ meals in two shopping visits. I really wish LC would resolve this for us.
LOVE the Chicken with Almonds!! Now send me my 5 codes !!!!
This Free bag promo is a joke. I buy at least 7 to 10 of these entrees per week. I have only found SIX codes in boxes, the rest don't have them. And they are all the same entree, chicken fettucini. What gives?
had the tortilla crusted fish and rice for lunch..totally delicious. I EAT LEAN CUISINE EVERYDAY... I HAVE DECIDED TO FORGET ABOUT THE BAG PROMOTION. THERE ARE A LOT OF BOXES ON THE SHELVES WITHOUT CODES. NOT WORTH THE TIME OR AGGREVATION 
Shop Rite in Phila., Pa has LC's on sale for $2.00 each. I purchaed 10 today. 5 of them were Chicken Ranch Club Flatbread Melts and all of them had codes inside! Think I'm buying more of them tomorrow....PS had one for dinner tonight & it was DELISH...
Thanks lean cuisine for sending me codes for my ones that I could not process.. it took awhile but thanks so much.., Be patient everyone..they came thru for me and it took several weeks..
This codes promotion for the free bags must be bogus. I've had several boxes with either no codes or codes that don't work. I leave comments on their "problems" site with all the information they want from the gray strip along the side. I get emails that say someone will address my issue in 5-7 days. Nothing. Never hear back, never get credit for my codes. By the time Lean Cuisine acknowledges me, the promotion will be over. This all seems like a big scam to get people to purchase the products with no intent to ever deliver.
Just polished off the Roasted Honey Chicken. First time I've tried it. WOW AND YUMMMM! :)
Thai Style Noodles with Chicken. Yum! I had no problem finding codes. My bag is on the way! You need to buy boxes at a high volume store like Walmart so they cycle through the older boxes without codes.
I've had 7 boxes with no codes so far and sent in all the required information over 2 weeks ago. I have heard nothing back!
Just purchased 20 boxes and all but 4 had codes.... Ordered my first bag..Getting the Jessica sent to me...Hey! However still waiting for replacement codes on 18 boxes...
To Kathleen R. - Good luck with that.. I've sent them over 5 messages on this promotion. . . never heard back from them. My final message to them was to keep their stupid lunch bag.
I got codes today for the 5 boxes I reported that had no codes, thanks LC
I sent an email on 1/16 regarding 7 boxes that had no codes. I sent all the info in the gray zone as requested. no response to date. I now purchased more dinners and out of 10 boxes, only 3 had codes! I am starting to think this is a real scam! why do they say then answer their email and a week later nothing?>?? How long does it take to get an answer???
No codes in any of the of the 6 boxes I've had!! Emailed that I didn't have codes and they wanted to proof of purchase and what kind, etc ... well you know what Lean Cuisine... all the time people are spending emailing tyring to collect these codes from boxes with no codes.. just isn't worth MY time!! 
I love the reply you get from Lean Cuisine when you post your comments here. It's a stock reply that just changes the name of who it's going to. BUT, I still haven't gotten any codes. I'm done. No more Lean Cuisines for me. This was a scam for people to buy their products through and through. I don't think they ever had any intention to give bags away.
Lean Cuisine emailed me 6 codes today ... I'm so happy.
Lean Cuisine emailed me 6 codes today. I'm so excited, it took a little over a week after sending the email.
I've had 15 lc's this month and found only one code?!?!? 
I have yet to get codes that don't work. Are typing in the dashes? I also type the letters in captials. This isn't a scam. There have been numerous people order bags. I guess if it was they might not get bags, but we will see. So far out of 5 boxes I have gotten 4 codes. I love LC meals and will continue buying them. I don't believe this is a scam since they sell plenty of product. Why would they pull a scam to sell more when they are already popular. Their sales weren't hurting.
Hmmm I have lean cuisine 5 days a week for lunch and have been doing this for almost 2 years now! ^_^ I have kept off 50lbs that I lost due to a very hard thyroid problems. I buy them all the time but since this started I have only gotten 5 codes?? To me that doesn't really work out too well, for I was thinking that I would have had almost 20 by now. Can you shed some light for me? Thank you guys for coming out with so many yummy things! The new snacks look sooo good!!!!! 
I can't find Thai Style Chicken and Rice anywhere. Do you still make it? It was sooooooo good too.
Why are your meals low in calories, but high in sodium? 600mg of sodium is cause for a heart attack. If these meals are suppose to be healthy why can't I eat them & not worry about my blood pressure going high??
I am addicted to the Parmesan FIsh entree. It tastes GREAT!
At one point you had a picture showing where the UPC and timestamp codes were on the boxes without the lunch bag codes. I wish that was available easily now!
Love the Lemongrass Chicken and hope I can find the new Garlic Chicken Spring Rolls...they sound awesome!!!
Just tried the Thai-style chicken spring rolls. Yummy! I sauteed them in a tblspoon of oil on the stove top so added a few extra calories :)
I haven't seen the garlic chicken egg rolls. they look good
well I finally got 20 codes.. although I have eaten over 40 meals.. I ordered my purse today says 8-12 weeks.. and keep posting my codes for new promotion starting in April.. the codes will roll over to that promo..pretty excited
I think everyone would have been less frustrated if Lean Cuisine had said from the start that you must buy boxes marked with the promotion in order to get the bag. I think it was a mistake for them to offer to send codes to people for boxes that were missing them. I have a freezer full of code-less boxes bought in the past week or so- but it is not worth it to me to hold on to the boxes to try and get codes- I have better things to do with my time. I chose to buy what was at the grocery store because they were on sale for 1.88- code or no code- I was going to stock the freezer. Yes, it is a bummer to not rack up the points in my account for future promotions but that was the choice I made when I bought meals without the purse symbol on them. I have lost 9 pounds in 3 weeks and that is what makes the happy no matter what.
I just heard from CS...they asked which meals I bought and do not have a code. At least I received a reply. Glad to see they are getting to us all.
I wish so much that you would return to making ALL of your food not just suitable for Microwaves, but also compatible with Conventional Oven cooking. P L E A S E !!!!!!!!!!!
Did they discontinue the linguine carbonara? I can only find the chicken carbonara and I don't like it because it has mushroons. 
What is this code we need to get the free lunch bagt? I've just been cutting out the bar code label from the box as I eat them. Is there something I'm missing?
I'm trying to go online & enter my codes off the boxes. I've registered & everything & I keep getting a error message???? I'm unable to enter my codes. 
Doggone site to enter the codes is down again. ugghh so frustrating
Plaza Research San Diego <3 's your lunches! It's all we eat! Thank you from Eli Pierre , Lauren Houle, Mindy Hertig and Sasha Llamas Kaplan !!!!!
I have had success with my codes on boxes and now that I am half way done My husband just got back to the store and no code on my first opened. Can someone tell me what I need to save and who to contact to get these fixed. Thank You
I absolutely LOVED the roasted vegie pizza!!! send me some coupons!! 
Can anyone tell me how long it took to get codes for the unmarked boxes? I sent an email about two weeks ago with all the upc codes and date stamps. I am just curious how long it takes to get a reply?
I don't buy Lean Cuisine so here's a free code I got from the grocery store check out: LCDC DF4N CXTNC
So I was prepared to enter 10 codes today... Opened my 10 packages and started entering the codes. Entered 4 successfully. Then my 5th code kept being rejected. I got the message: "We are sorry for your inconvenience. You've entered too many invalid codes. Be sure to check out the How It Works page to see how codes need to be entered and then come back tomorrow to enter your codes". Now it won't let me enter any more codes today! Told me come back tomorrow! Bad system--because there is a bad code, I get penalized! I understand it might be a security safeguard, but I enter MyCoke Reward points all the time on the Coke website and they never boot me out because of a bad code. BAD SYSTEM LEAN CUISINE!
Garlic Chicken Spring rolls are yummy! Too bad I ate both servings in the box!
i thought the said you could get a free code by selecting the "like" button on facebook?
I have my 20 codes, but I can not find on the web site were to redemm them. Can soneone help?
I have gotten boxes without codes recently...whats up with that???? 
It would be helpful if Lean Cuisine would post a legend for the letters/numbers. That would probably alleviate the "bad code" issue.
Just entered the last of my 20 codes, and ordered the Jessica lunch bag for my daughter. Only bought 20 boxes, every one had a code, and all the codes worked. The only problem I had at all wass about a week ago when the site was down for over 24 hours. 
YEA! I just ordered my Ashley bag. I love the pink polka-dots! I am a school teacher...so the "allow 8-12 weeks" for delivery means I will get it just in time for the end of the year! HA! Just hoping my old ratty lunch bag lasts 8-12 more weeks.
I am getting increasingly frustrated with the codes K's look like H's and I had an N today that I was sure was a K. Got shut out of entering the codes as I had entered the codes incorrectly too many times. Please Please Please give us a clue what the letters are or print them like normal letters. Add to the numerous boxes without codes and I am beginning to think that even though I eat Lean Cuisine for lunch every day at work (five times a week) I will never have enough cades for a bag.
Did they discontinue the linguine carbonara? I can only find the chicken carbonara and I don't like it because it has mushroons. Anyone know?
Finally got my codes for the "no code" boxes and I can order my bag Woo Hoo! 
Well, I'm a "Smart Ones" customer, but when I heard about the free lunch bag promotion, I decided to give LC a try. The food is actually very good. But out of the 10 meals I've purchased, 4 were missing codes! I still haven't heard back from CS, and it's been several weeks! Boo to LC!! I'll wait a little longer, but then I'm switching back to Smart Ones, they don't promise things they can't deliver!!!
Just tried the garlic chicken spring rolls for the first time....DELICIOUS!!!!
Is the site down to enter codes for the lunch bags? It won't accept my email or password. Maybe I forgot my password and I need to reset, but I just wanted to check and see if anyone else was experiencing problems.
the lean cuisine site seems to be confused today- I can log-in but can't get to the page to enter my codes- keeps telling me an error occurred. 
Dear Lean Cuisine - I LOVE your products, but can you please make more options without red peppers? I get that they're a cheap filler flavor, but they add a certain funk that overpowers all other flavors. 
I am eating broccoli beef right now!!
I am finding that I keep getting the message that my codes are entered incorrectly. They all seem to be codes that have what looks like a O or 0? How do you tell if it is an O or a zero?
LEAN CUISINE CHICKEN MARGHERITA--- The Bag EXPLODES about 1 Minute 45 Seconds into (5 minute) cooking!! I didn't even have to open the bag! WHY have a STEAM VALVE it the bag is going to explode??? Nice going, Stouffers! Elizabeth Las Vegas

Please excuse me to post this picture that it might be looked a bit off route as a fan page of my food blog. Personally, I'm indeed touched by the thousands and thousands of volunteers extending their helping hands in cleaning up the messy suburbs affected by the floods over the past few days. Isn't it amazing to see an army of volunteers lining up to register, bringing along with their own tools to help deal with the aftermath of Queensland floods? They call it "Queensland spirit".

I worked for Ross to put myself through my first undergraduate degree in Phoenix, AZ and then helped open Flagstaff AZ store in 1999...I can honestly say my experience working with Ross was one of the best things to date in my life...the training and skills I learned from the company continue to be helpful to me today, and I am so grateful for being a part of the Ross Team...as an employee then and as an always satisfied customer, now! Happy Happy New Year and thanks! 
OMG! My husband put an APB out on me tonite! He posted on FB, "Be on the lookout for my wife. Last reported heading for Ross store. Subject is considered to be armed with a empty shopping cart but claims to be going in for just 1 item. If you see her with more, aprehend immediately and take her to her car and do NOT let her back in." 
Hi had a problem today with my local ross I went in at 8:45pm checked the website before I went and store hours clearly said it would close at 9:30pm but when I got there the security kept telling me the store was closing and I needed to leave I informed him that the store didn't close till 9:30 and it was just 9 he said not this store so I told him okay proceeced to leave stopped in the front to get my husband and again was approached by the same man and the same thing was told to me don't think I will be going again after this incident. 
Something has happened in the last year or so that gives me hope that Ross has finally started moving in the right direction to provide wearable clothing for plus size women who want playful, clean, chic styles. Good Buyers are no longer ignoring our needs. Very Smart. Before now the selections have been sadly lacking. Now, after a hunt, I can usually find a few fun, thoughtful, well-made pieces that are easy to style up or down. There's still a way to go and you can demand better of your suppliers.
i have on sugestion for in the fitting room i work in one i dont really have a prob but can it be made almost manditory there be 2 people assined there even if it just tuesdays and even in the summer it get soo slammed back in those rooms that it is imposable to even think about picking up toys are any section for that matter idk if it is possable to pass that but what i have seen my 3 years of working thier i think it would help alot

hello to all new to this site but love food and recipies and love meeting and making new friends
The wintergreen salad is my favorite item there, but sometimes the goat cheese balls up. I asked the salad girl to try her best to not have that happen. She did it. Clumpless goat cheese confirmed. Delicious.
great quote from founder of brueggers bagels - Fast growth rates are appropriate in software, where your product can be replicated infinitely and distributed electronically. We slice bagels and make sandwiches. That doesn't happen in multiples of 10,000. It happens one order at a time
glendale fail tonite - power went out then oven wouldn't restart. fixed now though. if you came and couldn't get what you wanted, email for some coupons
and if anyone is curious, our meat is 100% meat. that is why our sandwiches are not $3.00
free lunch today for some peeps in boulder AND glendale: respond with the restaurant you would like free lunch for - in an hour i will pick 3 people for each restaurant
it is going to be silly cold today - don't forget that our boulder store delivers and both stores have lots of hot soup to keep you warm
it is cold and snowy. get over to modmarket for a pizza and some hot soup. we just added a few new pizzas to the menu today too
wow, a LOT of people are rolling through our denver store today. so cool to feed so many people in one day
Looking for some schools/charities in and around Glendale that want to do some fundraisers at Modmarket.
Our catering manager, jess, made some twice baked, locally sourced, purple fingerling potatoes for the bcycle event tonite. Wow.
I am addicted to our new winter salad toppings - shoestring sweet potatoes, marinated black beans and a veggie quinoa mix.
just toured the back of house of a nice sushi restaurant. It is shocking how simple their inventory management is compared to Modmarket. People really have no idea how difficult it is to offer all the fresh fruits and veggies that we do.
'Bravo PepsiCo for making fruit convenient. My only complaint is you can't eat the pouch'
ate at a place this weekend that touted the fact that they import all of their tomatoes and cheeses from italy. last time i checked, air shipping cheeses around the world is pretty unsustainable. and ridiculous. the absolute best mozzarella i have ever tasted was at Pizzeria Basta in Boulder and they make it in house from curd that comes from Colorado dairies.
when listing whether a dressing is vegan or not, should we say no to ones that contain honey? the vegan community seems divided on this one.
Did you know you can make hummus from edamame? Comes out a fantastic green color and when cut with some sambal has a nice kick
I was the first guest this evening at your new Denver location. I am very excited about modmarket opening litterally right next door to my apartment! The food was excellent, even the soda tasted better. I walked in expecting to buy some pizza and got my meal for free! You guys will be seeing me a lot!
PLEASE open a modmarket near old town Littleton! This area is dying for some fast healthy alternatives. Remember the burbs are full of once city dwellers that lost their way :). This market is completely underserved - help. First exp. at the Glendale location and now I am a huge fan.
we are ordering bike kits for this year - anyone interested in buying one (or maybe just a jersey?) clothes are super high quality made by Vermarc.
