22,29,The reps of @JetBlue are far less than pleasant up here in Buffalo. Bad mood guys?  We are the passengers.
37,45,@united flight crew on flt1655 gets kudos for keeping ditectv going during baggage delay.  What's with the ground crews here at ORD?
39,47,Both my departing and return @AlaskaAir (SEA&lt;-&gt;SFO) flights were delayed this weekend. Unusual bad luck or a sign of faltering service?
46,54,@JetBlue flying out of ACK tmrw. Understand there were delays today due to mechanical. Everything back on sched?
55,65,@AmericanAir My suitcase better make it. Would hate for on top of everything else it missed the connection!
56,66,@SouthwestAir flight 1222 PHX to STL LATE AGAIN!! Why does SWA keep allowing a connection from L.A for this flight? We always have to wait!!
60,71,@united Houston terminal C club has a bunch of broken power outlets.

107,121,@SouthwestAir it was handled so poorly. ;(
109,123,Gotta say @united disappointed my 10 hr flight had leaky condensation the crew knew about.  Napkins aren't a solution for an unwanted shower
110,124,Oh snap! Business class upgrade across the Atlantic! @united kicks ass!

158,173,@SouthwestAir I'm on a plane to Austin that is going land in Dallas cuz of mechanical issue. Dallas is my final destination. Can I get off?
160,175,@SouthwestAir -hubby is A List. Traveling w/ 3-yo companion. had to wait for family board. Why can't companions get on w/ A-List? With 3-yo?
180,195,Man @united terminal C in newark is a f'in mess. Ugly. paint is chipped everywhere. missing roof panels. this is like Somalia airport level
210,227,I've never flown with @VirginAmerica but it looks really cool
221,239,@AmericanAir just got on plane - that's narsty! Worst part - the past passenger didn't save any chips for me! http://t.co/SDAne4JmvZ
238,258,Our @united plane smells like a combo of pee.. sweat.. and tomato juice _
245,266,@JetBlue thanks for ruining our vacation!!! #worstairlines #neveragain
250,271,@AmericanAir was supposed to leave at 10:30 on AA#3539 but mechanical issue pushed flight back.
251,272,@jetblue your plane caught on fire midair and now we have to wait 3 hours for a new one. can't wait for our full refunds

260,281,@americanair I just got emailed a mobile boarding pass that isn't mine. This seems like a problem.
273,294,@VirginAmerica never disappoints. _
290,312,@united unacceptable as the crew could have done better to turn around the flight
291,313,@AlaskaAir had one working check-in kiosk in the Atlanta Airport. This seems like a poor ratio.
315,337,Moodlit mimosa at 30.000 feet in @VirginAmerica 1st Class not a bad way to start a vacay if I do say http://t.co/s23s6ouQZV
317,339,No @AmericanAir or US Airways lounge in DTW. It's a big airport. so I'm surprised. Sad face. At least I'm checked in and coming home!
318,341,I thought I was having a bad day when I was harassed on @SouthwestAir flight from Chicago earlier. By all of the flight attendants #racism
322,346,I fly about once a month. I can't remember the last time I've caught an on time @SouthwestAir flight. This. Sucks.
340,365,"i usually hate emails .. but when i don't ... it's a @SouthwestAir ""your trip is around the corner"" email _ "
347,372,Actually. @VirginAmerica  is so fucking chill #sfo
350,375,@JetBlue honestly I've never had a more stressful traveling situation!!!! From broken planes to inflight crews being late.... So frustrating
353,379,@AmericanAir could I ask why you are so shit?
360,387,Free upgrade to Main Cabin Select on @VirginAmerica ... Never happens!! #winning San Francisco bound _
381,415,@VirginAmerica just flew into Philly and picked up our cymbal bag. It didn't leave SFO like this. #partyfoul http://t.co/pz0XmWFM5D
382,416,So angry @VirginAmerica is pulling out of Philly. Super disappointing decision.
391,425,@southwestair Shamu flying out of ABQ. I'm gonna miss this bird.. I mean whale.. Either way I'm going__ http://t.co/FLh1mqYPzm

429,464,old guy sitting next to me looks awfully confused at me lip syncing along to the @VirginAmerica safety video.
431,467,@AlaskaAir  sad their is no power outlets on the way home 
435,472,One day I'm going to board a @united flight correctly and not anger a fellow passenger. Or just never fly this airline again.
440,477,I hate @AmericanAir!
448,485,I knew there was a reason I only fly @SouthwestAir. Never have a problem with them.
457,494,@AlaskaAir still waiting for you guys to find my hats #1monthlater

464,501,Didn't have time to get a drink or snacks before my  @VirginAmerica flight now it's delayed on the runway. The hunger and thirst is real.
468,505,I've never loved an airline as much as @JetBlue  Such wonderful people and service!
470,507,@JetBlue why are your flights always delayed or have mechanical issues?
473,510,Officially missed my flight home from #PAXPrime2014 :( Time to see what I can work out with @AlaskaAir customer support.
477,514,Hey @JetBlue let's pick up the speed on bag pick up. Takes all the fun Out of being early when waiting 30 min.
485,522,The @SouthwestAir lady checking my bag was horrid. but this visit is redeemed by the amazeballs fresh-squeezed OJ. Too bad it was about $7
488,525,"Huh. Booking @VirginAmerica flight and on purchase it told me both ""All done here!"" with a confirmation # and that there was a problem. Huh."
496,533,@SouthwestAir is TERRIBLE. After traveling to Arizona to pick up my BRAND NEW bike. they lost it and we just had to drive to pick it up.
500,537,So @united scratched the heck out of my new luggage. http://t.co/ysXwnyHj95
505,542,@AmericanAir seriously poor service. http://t.co/c6rN78uuA1

542,581,What's happening @AlaskaAir ? On my current trip my last 2 flights were delayed by mechanical issues 8/29 flight 606 and 9/1 flight 601
543,582,@AlaskaAir why do you allow your pilots to outright lie...  He just announced he didn't know the delay length. yet apparently you do
562,601,Who the Traveling Owl is not happy with his seat. but I am! @VirginAmerica #Boston here we come! http://t.co/9O8JW0VuuB

826,877,@JetBlue love the service. hate the puns.... Never change please?

920,974,@united really was that pathetic tweet all you had to say for yourselves?
929,984,@SouthwestAir views like this make small delays less annoying. http://t.co/AIi15MLaFB
930,985,@JetBlue not happy about your new policy with the $75 change fee over the phone. How about you enable a change online for free?
932,987,@united I'm going to miss my 11pm flight to BOS from PHX. when's the next avail flight to BOS??
938,993,"@SouthwestAir is there an issue with the ""low fare finder"" on http://t.co/FVDjn8DeUN. it doesn't switch months after the initial search."

966,1022,BAD MOVE @JetBlue!! Really really bad. UGH so screwed now #dontflyjetblue
973,1029,Yeah. too bad @southwestair has stopped service to Jackson. MS. http://t.co/iaerB5PlUB
990,1046,@AmericanAir it seems habitual. Especially when more than 50% on delayed flights say that it happens particularly with your business.
992,1048,Officially a #rapidrewards member! @SouthwestAir .. Can't wait to fly my first time with you!
996,1052,Another @AlaskaAir win. Sent in negative (not too bad) comments yesterday &amp; got call about it today from friendly lead agents wanting info.
1000,1056,@AmericanAir always disappointing to find old brown F seats on a 757 but even worse to see the edge looking like this http://t.co/61n8U5t1Gf
1002,1059,"@united Actually. it was cancelled because the crew ""timed out"". But we have waited since 7:25pm anyway. http://t.co/6NSvQsJ2O4"
1003,1060,@SouthwestAir why board the plane from BWI to PIT when you're going to make us wait 30+ minutes before you close the door?
1018,1075,@AmericanAir You will hear from later! You so upset me!
1025,1085,Its incredibly annoying that @SouthwestAir doesn't have a direct flight from Buffalo to Atlanta
1030,1090,@AmericanAir please can you tell me the status of flight no 55 leaving Manchester at 10.40 to go to Chicago? Missed call from you overnight

1053,1116,@AmericanAir I've come to expect decent airplanes 2million miles.but this USAir you stuck me on is awful.
1056,1119,Super annoying that my 825 flight didn't leave til 1am CT but props to @JetBlue for making it a little more bearable #unlimitedpopchips
1064,1127,@united I will be contacting corporate in writing explaining my disappointment
1069,1132,Congrats @VirginAmerica on becoming just as awful as American Air. It took five years but you fell that low.
1076,1140,@united no worries. It was an Apple issue last none_none of the apps were available for some users.
1077,1141,We took an international flight with our 4 month old....and it wasn't that bad! Blog post to follow. CC: @AmericanAir http://t.co/o201Bp0Pjl
1081,1146,Very disappointed in @SouthwestAir - playing games just like all the other airlines. Won't be flying them again. Very sad. #don'treallycare
1086,1151,So @AmericanAir 150$ for a surf board!? One surf board!? #notcool
1090,1155,And all the people in nearby seats on my @southwestair flight breathed a collective sigh of relief. #sleepingbaby http://t.co/Sre4yhPqC8
1093,1158,"Never flying@SouthwestAir again. there is no leg room! Did they add more seats? I'm only 5'10"" and I couldn't move!"
1094,1159,Still angry. weeks later. that @united moved me from my aisle seat to a middle seat without asking me. There has to be some rule...
1095,1160,@united It won't let me wait for the gate. it wants the $200 now.
1105,1171,Early bird waiting for my flight with @virginamerica :) thanks for the working desk! #startup http://t.co/ETHKehL447

1136,1205,Really @united you're charging us a change fee &amp; point to leave Cabo early when it's under a tropical storm warning??!! #notnice
1140,1210,@VirginAmerica. left some items in my seat back yesterday. and can't seem to get a response from Virgin America lost and found at O'Hare.
1145,1215,@SouthwestAir I booked flight yesterday to Austin. Why do you never have promotional codes for that or Birthday discounts just asking?
1146,1216,Delayed @AlaskaAir from GEG? This never happens. And of course it does on a day that actually matters _
1147,1217,@AlaskaAir what happened to Flt 28 today. Plane an N3 and no one to move it to N7? An hour late. NOT COOL.
1153,1223,@VirginAmerica awful! Love Field is a hell hole. Stay at DFW. we need more rival airlines at the hub to stand down against the man.

1240,1319,@united we replied back to the email and rejected the $50 credit still waiting for you to step up!
1273,1353,@VirginAmerica I did that b4 but VX doesn't fly enough places I go every week from LA yet so I didn't re-qualify within the 90 days #stuck
1285,1365,After reading some of @AmericanAir tweets sounds like they do a lot of apologizing for their crappy services.
1291,1371,@AmericanAir just landed. Agh. music is back. Truly. what demo likes canned piano? This music is depressing. Sad now. Depressing vaca start
1292,1372,I love @JetBlue but the fact that I've had to argue with them over why they should compensate me for FOUR canceled flights is just... ugh.
1295,1376,Big thanks to John at @AlaskaAir for providing true excellence in customer service after our flight was delayed yesterday!

1327,1412,What's up @JETBLUE??? Why are you making us wait in line with less than 3 attendants?

1334,1419,@AlaskaAir has a new way of boarding  -- no bags for the overhead bin? Get on first.  Kudos. kudos. kudos..
1337,1422,Ugh. Need some lifehack to upgrade on @united international only using miles instead of miles+dollars. $600 for 1 leg of a 4 leg $1200 fare?
1351,1438,@JetBlue um...did Jennifer Grey almost kill her career with a nose job?!? The answer to everything is YES!
1360,1448,Experiencing @VirginAmerica's in-flight safety music video. Missed it when it went viral. In other news...I'm old.
1363,1451,@united  You can't leave people frigging stranded  and  just say oh here have some money back  get  em on another flight or close your doors

1434,1527,@AmericanAir why did you change all the MIA/ATL aircrafts to regional jets for that route during the daytime?  I miss getting upgraded.
1438,1531,Oh. @AmericanAir you are breaking my heart.  Delayed to Chicago. #ICNLS  #howaboutnow #isitherenow #whataboutnow
1450,1545,@united I have to say its annoying when you separate res of family traveling together at check in. As a 1k member. I hate this.
1451,1546,@AmericanAir Just noticed boarding passes for tomorrow don't have mine or wife's middle initial (which is on driver's licenses). Any issue?
1454,1549,No PB&amp;J on my @VirginAmerica flight and now I am sad _
1455,1550,It's like a lounge in here! No longer a virgin to @VirginAmerica.  #firsttime #stayhungrystayfoolish http://t.co/UFGQ3JYo6z
1462,1559,@AlaskaAir thanks to your poor planning of 626 I've lost almost an entire day of my trip. AND now I'm eating mcgriddles. You did this to me.
1475,1573,@united Can't wait to fly in one. What routes will it be flying?
1480,1578,A brief telephone call with @united reminds my of why I should never fly with them. Always a bad customer experience. from start to finish.
1484,1583,@VirginAmerica thank you. i ended up switching to chrome from firefox and it worked...very odd!
1491,1590,Hey @JetBlue! This well-traveled panda can't wait to fly with you today! http://t.co/6LTbA7e8L9

1494,1593,Flight from San Diego to Chicago Midway re-routed to Indy. Missed my connection! Am I going to make it to Detroit today? @SouthwestAir
1496,1595,@AmericanAir I'd like to see an old TWA tail livery on one of these. Too Bad you didn't acquire PanAm!. MGMT may be AmWest but it is ugly.
1497,1596,@AlaskaAir now she has to wait 12 hours in SFO for another fly to miami and after that other fly miami-bogota. #badservice thank you a lot
1498,1597,@AlaskaAir Will you tell your email support to quit emailing me about an issue your phone support solved a week ago?
1504,1603,@VirginAmerica    all checked in for SFO frm DFW tomorrow. Can't wait for the #VirginAmerica experience &amp; 1st trip home in 6 yrs.
1505,1604,One thing you can rely on is @AmericanAir screwing up your upgrades.  3 for 3 on int'l travel...thanks. guys!
1507,1606,@AmericanAir oh no. Just a previous dissatisfied fare.
1537,1638,Thank you @virginamerica for making it look cool. Can't wait to make em' move in the #bayarea_ http://t.co/17SQDUWIB0

1548,1650,"@VirginAmerica Can I cancel a ""points"" purchase I made?"
1552,1655,@AmericanAir can't wait to see AirCal and TWA jets. Suggestion put AirCal on  a 737-800 as they flew mostly 737s
1556,1659,Love to fly with @JetBlue . And had never been in Boston before. Wishing to go someday. #ScoreEvenMore  #BostonCalling2014

1567,1673,@AmericanAir (PS: I don't blame you. I understand the need to switch planes. I'm just nervous!)
1572,1678,@DeltaAssist Hi.  I have a booking question.  I am having some issues using both the flexible dates and multiple cities options.
1577,1683,That feeling when you arrive at your destination and your new luggage is damaged @JetBlue #familytravel
1582,1689,@united trapped like a rat on flight 106. pulled away from the gate and now we wait!!!!
1584,1691,@AlaskaAir Thanks. I've already sent it through the survey on the site. just wanted to let you know that the process is unpleasant.
1586,1693,hey @united. once I paid you for internet. I can no longer access the portal that allows me to watch movies/check flight status #bugreport
1592,1699,@DeltaAssist Problem with supervisor at online support. named Samuel. in Dallas (gave no other info).
1598,1705,@DeltaAssist trying to make flight 2604 7:45 JFK-DTW. Stuck in traffic. Will be at airport at 7. Tell them to wait? _
1599,1706,Anyway. @VirginAmerica I can't stay mad at you. 
1600,1709,Guess I'm going to renew my @AmericanAir moratorium. Always a bad experience. #5hourdelay #coulddrivehomefaster
1607,1717,Finally boarded my @AmericanAir flight!!! GRR ---&gt; ORD. First stop. Chicago. I'm finally heading back to LA!!! __

1612,1722,@united should you or me tell my best friend I'm not going to make his bachelor party because your plane is two hours late and counting?
1617,1727,Stuck on the ramp in Detroit.  Hey @DeltaAssist are you holding our connections? DL 6391 to #roc
1622,1732,@AmericanAir still waiting for the day when I login and scream my lungs out seeing your name in my followers list _
1623,1733,En route to LA via @VirginAmerica. I have never seen such good looking passengers. #partybus
1624,1734,Shredded tire. stuck in Grand Rapids and the United pilots bought all of us left at the gate pizza. @united flt4674 pilots rock!!!
1633,1744,@JetBlue thank you for the credit for the delayed flight last night. I didn't complain at all. so this was unexpected. But much appreciated.
1638,1749,Flew on @VirginAmerica this weekend for the first time. Am utterly ruined for any other airline ever....they are amazing!
1644,1755,Real speech @SouthwestAir I ain't NEVER seen a $69 airfare.
1655,1766,Photoset: operationdenver: Mechanical diversion to SeaTac today. Had to get a few shots. of course. @united http://t.co/LO4LcpmnLS
1657,1768,@united - bad service again: open flight little earlier won't let me on without $75...2 flights in a row. fall flights: different airline
1658,1769,Attn @united TSA: if you hate your job so much. find a new one.
1661,1772,@AlaskaAir flight 2692 twice had to return to LAS on way to SLC today. Super annoying delay but service recovery commendable. #lessangry
1670,1782,@united it hasn't trained since noon! Flight was scheduled to leave at 540.
1672,1784,really gonna suk for you all when Cavs season starts. and people need flights to Cleveland. but you're no longer a hub @United
1677,1789,Love seeing the @AlaskaAir commercials during #SEAvsGB. My brand crush. Can't wait to fly Monday! #iflyalaska
1688,1800,Guy__ What if the new @SouthwestAir livery is Eurowhite? I__d be devastated. Not going to lie. I__d probably cry a little.
1691,1803,@VirginAmerica Why does your only flight from PDX leave at 7am. Whyyyyyyy.
1709,1822,@DeltaAssist Landed at Dulles tonight. ID may have been lost along the way (still looking).  Can I get trough TSA without it?
1718,1831,Way to go @AmericanAir ... Lost 4 car seats..
1720,1833,@JetBlue this is a long time coming but thank you for resolving my issue when I flew with you recently. Appreciate the quick turn around!
1724,1837,@united I'm waiting for your official confirmation about where's the baggage. File report correct is FCOUA15585 http://t.co/JGHTiXehJz
1743,1856,@JetBlue is it possible to speak with a manager? I have an important issue that I would like to discuss.
1752,1865,FREE #wifi on my @JetBlue flight. Good?  Or. bad?  I'm supposed to be off the grid but feel like I won the lottery!
1759,1873,Waiting until it's boarding time  @SouthwestAir
1760,1874,@united Surely not all of your fleet is in disrepair. Yet somehow both of my last 2 flights were delayed for mechanical problems. Endemic?
1761,1875,WSJ on point. No adequate space for laptop work on @united flight this week. and reclining only made it worse. http://t.co/ZTgOYLiUBY
1764,1878,@united I'll also be writing Jeff Smisek. because I believe the President/CEO should know the series of bad decisions that led to the loss.
1766,1880,Angry about the damage caused to my bag by @united ground staff at LFT this morning! Saw them drop it! http://t.co/Q5oRWMYy9u
1774,1888,@united needs to fix my stroller. which you broke.  See my tweets!
1785,1899,@AmericanAir have I missed the Q and A with one of you're pilots :-( ???
1791,1905,Here we go again @united  Another trip. another mechanical delay. Why can't you function like a real airline? #unfriendly
1805,1922,@AlaskaAir site down? I upgraded my browser. cleared cookies. restarted...still not working.
1806,1923,@AmericanAir #customerservicefail http://t.co/1cc1zzjA1g
1814,1931,If you're not following @JetBlue. you're missing out. Their Social Media Team rocks! Good work. guys! You're awesome! #lovemyB6family
1815,1932,@DeltaAssist 8CKQ43 Can't check in online. The flights look full. Should we be looking for alternate flights home? Don't want to get stuck!
1821,1938,Still waiting on my charges from @VirginAmerica to be released from limbo. I swear if these actually post I'm going to scream.
1823,1940,@AlaskaAir if the cramped crappy plastic chairs in coach is your new norm to Hawaii. I will most definitely be changing airlines. #cramped
1824,1941,@VirginAmerica Boston! I am flying there with you on the 24th!! Can't wait!! Upgrade in my future. perhaps??
1826,1943,@DeltaAssist no. I'll have to address via phone when I land. Faa regulations issue. Semantics. Praying item checked does not break.
1828,1945,Sigh. @united wants $2k for a family of 3 to travel to see family for Thanksgiving.Anytime that week. even starting Sun or Mon. #hateflying
1837,1954,@united why are there always delays when flying out of Chicago? Awaiting incoming plane. Waiting on crew. #frustrated  #bypassCHI
1847,1965,My #Virgin america flt from PHL to Sfo last night rocked! Best landing We will miss you @VirginAmerica come back to #PHL  soon!!
1849,1967,On a @united flight-- caught the briefing video and grabbed my own bad video! http://t.co/wph2AZDcfZ

1853,1971,@DeltaAssist Oh Delta. mechanical issues on Tuesday delayed me 7 hours and now mechanical issues today had me miss my connection...*sigh*
1858,1976,@VirginAmerica Wait a minute - you don't know where you are?
1860,1979,Either @SouthwestAir boarding process makes people stupid. or only stupid people buy SWA. either way this reflects poorly on me.
1865,1984,@AmericanAir Now they can't find one of my vouchers I had to beg for. Will never fly with you again. GO SOUTHWEST!!!
1867,1986,@SouthwestAir poor taste considering one is flying unresponsive today.
1873,1992,@AmericanAir I was okay with the hour delay. But house-flies and no A/C in 1st class... come on...
1880,2000,@JetBlue please make sure you are early tomorrow !!! No delayed flights
1884,2004,With the implosion of Atlantic City. will @united cancel its direct service from IAH and ORD to there?
1901,2025,@SouthwestAir is having plane issues so we had to de board.....but it's still better than ghost airlines!!!!!
1902,2026,Day 4 on standby @AlaskaAir  still waiting to see a doctor... Thanks. #biggerplanes #stuckindutch
1906,2030,@AmericanAir you arrangement me another flight bog - Paris them from there to corea. but paris-corea  wasn't paid so I was trapped there.
1907,2031,@AlaskaAir disappointed the crossword puzzle in the Sept. issue is the exact one as the August issue! :/
1909,2033,Find My mother's luggage @AmericanAir   She is at Istanbul waiting to board a cruise and you lost it http://t.co/saAW8C6MIk
1913,2037,@DeltaAssist What was the reason for delay for DL392?
1924,2048,Switched my flight to @AmericanAir... Much better:)
1935,2059,@SouthwestAir Ill be flying with you guys in October PHX&gt;STL cant wait. I just hope my return flight isnt delayed 6hrs like last time!
1936,2060,Hey @AmericanAir. please tell me that this chunk missing from the wing of my airplane is somehow okay... http://t.co/9IwJQVU5zp
1941,2066,@JetBlue flight 0263 NYC --&gt; Seattle. No TV or power outlets :(
1943,2068,@united if you know there is a ground stop in Chicago why would you board delayed flight 3367. taxi out only to end up in the penalty box?
1944,2069,@DeltaAssist do I have recourse for a brand new golf bag that was damaged on my delta flight?
1949,2075,@united way to go. Rebook me bc I missed door close by 3 secs to a flight that then leaves 20 min for no reason. Thus I lost half a day n u?
1955,2081,@united why have us all board the plane to then go out and wait on the Tarmac?
1956,2082,@JetBlue why is 1237 out of boston delayed ?
1968,2094,Never flying @united again.  Third time in a row this has happened. Third time in a row I won't make my destination
1969,2095,"So excited to be back ""home"" at #JFK #T5! You can take the girl out of @JetBlue. but you can never take #JetBlue out of the girl! #wassup"
1972,2099,Rain has stopped. sun is peeking out. but still delayed....thanks @SouthwestAir lightening delay but all workers are walking around outside
1987,2115,"2 flights cancelled today and I'm waiting for the third ""shoe"" to drop. Time for a staring contest @united"
1988,2116,@AmericanAir Hi - any chance you can help my elderly mother - stuck in O'Hare due to you cancelled flight to DSM? Ground staff not helping:(
1999,2128,@SouthwestAir can you tell me what's going on with Flight 185 from LGA to MDW? Waiting for someone....
2002,2131,@united - Why do you bother allowing me to tell you I would like to fly in the evening if you're going to start with the 7:00am flight?
2003,2132,Thank you @VirginAmerica for a delightful flight to LA today! Can't wait for my return trip!
2005,2134,@VirginAmerica not sure what you can do now. Perhaps ask agents to use good judgement? Hope this is not an issue on return from SFO-AUS.
2017,2146,@DeltaAssist fight was delayed 4891. Missed connection 1289. Not my fault. what do we do?
2024,2153,Wait! If my boarding pass reflects a different time than I'm actually supposed to board can they pass me up? _ #justkidding @DeltaAssist
2031,2161,@SouthwestAir my ORF-BWI-TPA flight delayed 6 hours due to mechanical issues. stuck in BWI tonight. No voucher no meals? What? #southwest
2032,2162,@DeltaAssist I'm stuck on the plane as they are changing the tire
2049,2180,"Really AA?!? ""your bag is lost/we found it/come pick it up/oh yeah our office is closed. sorry. @AmericanAir I've never been so disappointed"
2057,2188,Ok. @united for every ten minutes my flight is delayed. I'm downing a mini bottle of wine. It doesn't have to end this way.
2071,2203,@AlaskaAir -planning my next trip to see the Northern Lights...via Alaska! Can't wait!
2074,2206,First time flying with @SouthwestAir and both my flights were delayed. Boooo _
2076,2208,@SouthwestAir if our plane is cleared for takeoff after this warning light went off I'm going to be very upset!!!
2086,2218,@AlaskaAir I've never had a worse experience in ~20 yrs of flying than the simplest of flights today from LAX. Never flying Alaska again!!
2087,2219,@AmericanAir no longer loyal. I'll spread my next few years of 150k - 200k miles around. unlike my last few.
2089,2221,@DeltaAssist hello! I have a small issue and need to see how much it would cost to take a later flight next Friday. Please DM me
2098,2230,All I know is @JetBlue would be compensating us somehow for all these delays. I will never cheat on them with another airline again.
2099,2231,@united Why did you cancel my flight tomorrow? Now missing a wedding rehearsal. UA4936
2102,2234,@AlaskaAir is there a way to switch to an earlier flight on the same day as my booked flight without a big $$ charge?
2106,2238,@AmericanAir Just landed on 343 from LGA to ORD. 2hr delay but pilots&amp;crew were total pros.We could tell pilots working hard for smooth ride
2107,2239,"Mechanic kicked us off my 100th flight this year... Bummer! @DeltaAssist 889 ""doesn't have a chance."" Glad I confirmed later!"
2108,2240,Not the plane..no bad weather..what's up @SouthwestAir #Ihatedelaysfornoapparentreason
2112,2244,The wifi on @AlaskaAir is sooooo bad.
2113,2245,@JetBlue flight 1011 brutal - will be 9 hrs of travel from Boston to Chicago.
2116,2248,@DeltaAssist stuck in Detroit. your pilots are too close on flight hrs for us to even taxi out. A lot of unhappy people.
2119,2251,My flight time today is insane and I haven't even left Raleigh. This is awful @united ! better communication is needed.
2120,2252,So many problems with @united #cantdeal
2123,2255,@SouthwestAir your flights are shit
2124,2256,@AmericanAir um you strand us because the crew didn't bother showing up then reservations just hung up on me mid conversation? Classy.
2125,2257,@AlaskaAir just emailed me the worst deal of all time... Lol  http://t.co/sdOjMluXxz
2130,2262,Shame on @SouthwestAir. fly my 84 yr old dad and 76 yr old mom to KY instead of Chicago. and tell them next flight to LAX is tomorrow? (1/2)

2167,2302,@JetBlue Thanks for the update. Finally made it back home phew _ not happy going to work the next day though!!!
2168,2303,@united so much for that folks. Flight canceled out of O'Hare. This after waiting around for 2 hours waiting for the pilots to show up.
2175,2310,@JetBlue any chance flight #89 JFK to San Diego seat 15C of finding my battery pack for my iPhone in the seat back pouch.... #lost
2177,2313,@united I'm in Rome but lost &amp; found office tell us that management is no longer their responsibility. What I need to do to get the baggage?
2183,2320,@AmericanAir your mobile app rocks! It removed my boarding pass while I was in line and I missed my flight and a wedding! Solid work.
2194,2332,.@AlaskaAir I was supposed to be on a flight to MIA tonight but my reservation was lost. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. #FAIL

2215,2355,@AmericanAir 2772. They're still looking into the issues.
2222,2362,Never have anything but a great experience with @JetBlue. Thanks for another smooth flight!

2226,2366,First your copilot is an hour and a half late causing everyone to miss their connecting flights. and now your plane is broken? @AmericanAir
2231,2371,You guys have never had a flight leave on time in the history of air travel @AmericanAir
2250,2391,@VirginAmerica can wait for the Love gates to open flt to LAS http://t.co/4RIsVNriuP
2252,2394,Left at like 3:05 for a 6 am flight out of Indy. #Missed it. @AmericanAir saved the day. Having green bean fries at Fridays n Ft Worth.
2253,2395,@VirginAmerica how I miss you! You should start flying FLL to Chicago so I can fly you more. See you next month to San Fran!
2255,2397,@SouthwestAir won't let me go to the bathroom while we wait for our gate and I feel like my bladder is going to explode!! This is painful!
2258,2400,I wish airtran would switch my voucher over to @SouthwestAir  quicker so I can book my tickets #iwanttoflywithmyfriends
2262,2404,Hi @DeltaAssist stuck in mid seat on my flight tonight. any chance I can get an exit row or available window/aisle if someone is bumped?
2267,2409,Previous tweet courtesy of @AmericanAir who will hopefully track that guy down. Bill him for lost airtime!
2270,2412,@SouthwestAir I miss the show #airlines
2274,2417,@united excuse me. I'm platinum and upgraded to deal with a sore back. and got stuck with a seat that doesn't recline. This sucks
2281,2425,Since @AmericanAir chooses to ignore  me I am filing a complain with BBB ....tired of waiting http://t.co/WjAC4WWI5H
2282,2426,At O'Hare yesterday with 87yr old mother enroute to Ottawa CA funeral. Ottawa flt cancelled &amp; plan B flt to #CLE landed 3AM. @united weather
2285,2429,@AmericanAir 3 hours late and still no clear time to leave. This is absurd... Connection missed to MCO. holiday trip starting bad....
2289,2433,@united You cancelled my connection to BWI from EWR ??? You are killing me!!! Conf #M6KJ3S
2290,2434,@VirginAmerica is this available San Fran to Vegas? Flying with you for the first time next week :)) can't wait!
2297,2442,@DeltaAssist Why the heck do you decide to leave early than the schedule flight plan you give your customers? You did it twice today to me.
2312,2458,@AmericanAir got a call that my bag is in London but I am in Miami. My friends bag still missing. No one wants to make this better. Fed up!
2316,2462,@SouthwestAir has become one of the #worstairlines - always #delayed #southwest
2320,2466,On our way to Ft Lauderdale from SFO on Thursday. I paid 4 an upgrade seat for me and my wife on @VirginAmerica they switch gate and all bad
2327,2473,@AmericanAir lost flight back to MIA AA914 was closed 2.5 hrs before departure because the national guard in CCS just wanted to leave early
2336,2483,Hate @AmericanAir Thought I had my issue resolved only to find out a day later that your agent didn't actually make any of the changes.
2347,2495,@united  I found a direct flight into BDA from AA . JFK  Business Class $100 less. I'm going miss you .
2352,2500,Never mind! @AmericanAir just changed my seat to a window and extra leg room. Then y'all wonder why I fly with them all the time. #spoiled
2365,2514,.@AmericanAir I had a lot of planned. things that needed to be done &amp; was inconvenienced heavily. Missed my flight. Totally unacceptable.
2368,2517,Yes. flight delays are incredibly annoying. But I know @united is doing their best. Hopefully wheels up to PDX soon!
2370,2519,Thank you Carrie at @JetBlue Pittsburg for getting us closer seats to the front so we don't miss our flight to Ireland. #greatful
2371,2520,Never flying with @AlaskaAir again in my life.
2372,2521,.@AmericanAir last time with 30 HSers. this time for my BFF's shower. Please fix your planes - don't want to miss life's big moments #AA4259
2374,2523,When did @AlaskaAir become the most expensive way to fly from Seattle to Hawaii? Weird. Sad. :) Want to support the hometown team. but...
2378,2527,@JetBlue my flight got switched and I'm not happy.
2386,2535,@AlaskaAir Flight 3467 from Tucson to Portland was quality all around. I cannot wait to fly with you again. Top notch!
2394,2543,@AlaskaAir tell dca air traffic control to let flight 764 off the plane! We've been on the runway waiting for a gate for an hour. Not cool.
2402,2551,If Michigan loses to Notre Dame tonight I'm blaming @AmericanAir for making me miss the game. #goblue
2405,2555,@VirginAmerica if i book a flight from NYC to LON online do I have 24 hours to cancel for full refund?
2409,2560,@JetBlue Flying out of SYR in 9 days which is my 35th birthday! Can't wait to fly to Vegas on Jet Blue. Should be an awesome birthday!!!
2418,2569,"@JetBlue flight777 Boston to Las Vegas. How can you switch the gate at 8:06 PM for an 8:11 PM flight and still list the status as ""On Time""?"
2428,2581,@JetBlue - I have to be honest with you &amp; fess up now. I'm flying w/DL Wed. because you can't take me TPA-&gt;RIC. Pls don' t be mad at me.
2434,2587,No @JetBlue tvs from Orlando to providence?! Babies everywhere?! PANIC!!!!! Ahhhhhhh!!!!!
2453,2606,@SouthwestAir Can't wait to hear about it!
2465,2618,Heading home after a short but gr8 trip! Cannot wait 2 get 2 my #brandloveaffair w/ @Jetblue #OnceYouGoMint https://t.co/FToSeL4CQS

2475,2629,I have a problem. @AmericanAir
2486,2640,@united My luggage didn't make it. but I have a claim in. so I'll wait for updates or it to be delivered.
2497,2652,@SouthwestAir hate our new paint job. ;-( #embarrasment
2500,2655,@VirginAmerica trying to tell me my keyboard is not allowed on the plane...you are evil!
2503,2658,@united no problem
2507,2662,@DeltaAssist Hi. where do I email damage claims please?
2511,2666,@SouthwestAir how does it make sense when my brother has the same flight at 9 am and the 7am is not sold out... Why can't he switch?
2521,2677,Each time I fly @united they always find a way to make me never want to fly them again 
2527,2683,@DeltaAssist delta is the worst. Separated from my husband on honey moon flight and now he's separated from his best friends all bc of
2529,2685,#delta fail at LAS bag drop. 1 sky priority and 7 regular. yet no regular lanes will help sky priority @DeltaAssist
2534,2691,Useful add in Liverpool Tube Station since @United didn't bother to email flight info. https://t.co/UzkSKthQFe http://t.co/fzDtrOxbvn
2547,2704,@JetBlue thanks to the kind gate agents at LAS for helping me to return a lost cell phone. #goodkarma #Vegas
2552,2709,@AmericanAir waiting for a flight now. But have been at O'Hare since 8:30pm yesterday. Ugh.
2553,2710,@AmericanAir I own I can't scream bomb in a plane or an airport but can I scream gun if I see one?
2556,2713,I've got one less problem with @VirginAmerica: they just put me in the pre-check line. 1 minute security line? Yes please!
2560,2717,@united Any advice on this issue?
2562,2722,Hearing my co-worker issues with @united flight out of CLE today. Im not looking forward to my flight tomorrow. Ugh.
2570,2732,@united what happened to you. Old Continental = best airline 5 years in a row .the new united = worst airline 2 years in a row
2579,2741,@JetBlue My appologies for the delay in uploading the video about #trueblue swag__it__ll be there soon. Thanks!
2585,2747,Ok @JetBlue. if flying out of Tampa do I get national or local NFL coverage? Basically. do I get to watch SF or am I stuck with the Bucs?
2590,2752,@DeltaAssist I paid for nonstop and you switched it to 1 stop. Not the product I paid for. No vouchers. no reduced price?
2595,2757,So tsa pre check has ruined @united Premier access???  You just go to the end of the security line.  Not really premier?
2603,2765,I wish @SouthwestAir would let spouses share rewards/miles. Seems like a waste not to when we already share a Visa.
2606,2768,@AmericanAir sent my parents 40th wed anniversary present 2 Argentina now have nothing 2 give at 2days celebration-so disappointed!
2610,2772,.@SouthwestAir mentioned IKEA__s Home Survey in this month__s issue of their inboard magazine! http://t.co/UFVs07vT9V
2613,2775,Everytime @JetBlue delay in Seattle. EVERYTIME!!!#cuetheautomatedresponse
2617,2779,I hate how @SouthwestAir always come out wit deals on flights after you paid full value a refund should be given or somethin
2619,2781,Anyone else remember when you could get a cheap @SouthwestAir flight to a major city. What the heck happened?!?
2621,2783,Oh man. why the flight delay @AlaskaAir? As much as I like Vegas. I'm ready to get home!
2638,2800,@SouthwestAir I just saw a commercial for flights for $69! :) I'm just curious why I can never find them when I'm booking a ticket!?_
2643,2805,@JetBlue patiently waiting for flight 598 to Boston to takeoff....
2647,2809,Thanks @JetBlue for the destroyed suitcase and the game of phone tag today. It's been delightful. http://t.co/qVZfc5V4XN
2648,2810,Flying @SouthwestAir to Dallas for MIT and the big announcement. Can't wait. #swamit
2650,2812,@AmericanAir How can I file a damaged bag claim without going back to the airport? I have before and after photos.
2656,2818,@united you guys lost my uncles bags from his flight from London to NJ. with his medications and it's been 2 days without answers! Whats up?
2665,2827,Definetly disappointed to have my Gem Drop X potential crushed because of buggy game play on my @VirginAmerica Flight
2672,2834,@AlaskaAir thanks so much. No worries about the delay.
2677,2840,@DeltaAssist 4 out last 4 flights no pre check. Is there issue porting KTN over from my Alaska profile? PNR: H2B3QX
2679,2842,@JetBlue I was stuck on the plane. sitting on the tarmac :( thanks for the travel credit though! Hoping for better next time
2684,2848,@AmericanAir Where is our plane? Going to miss my connection. #travelvirginair
2693,2857,@united Tracy S. Of Traverse City definitely isn't your best employee. #rude
2704,2868,@DeltaAssist Hi. Can't fill in the form as I don't have a file reference number. Damage occurred with your code share partner.
2710,2874,@AmericanAir status of 1530? Stuck on plane at gate w no news
2711,2875,Stuck waiting for our flight w/ @united b/c the flight attendant lost her phone &amp; shes looking for it! You have to be kidding me!
2719,2883,@DeltaAssist been stuck in alabama. Missed my connecting flight to dfw and probably at this rate the rest tonight too. Have work tmrrw also
2724,2888,NOW LIVE TWEETING THE REST OF MY TIME STUCK ON A @SOUTHWESTAIR PLANE IN ATX. #StuckinATX #PartyOnAPlane
2739,2906,@united  i need assistance. My disable parents are traveling from McAllen International to Chicago Ohare need to speak to attd re delay
2746,2913,So annoyed with @united we are stuck on our plane since there are 47 planes in front of us. Where was the planning in that!?
2751,2918,Really @SouthwestAir??? Why do you let Cs and Bs board with As in some airports? This guys gf who was a C just boarded with him in MCO #mad
2760,2927,@DeltaAssist #DeltaSucks this is the second time being delayed on this trip. I will never fly Delta again.
2761,2929,@DeltaAssist do Diamonds not get upgraded 5 days prior any longer?
2762,2930,.@united stranded in AUS. was stuck on tarmac. But Capt. Raymond Haynes is a class act! Escorted us off plane and kept us updated! Props!
2765,2934,Knowing that your other flight left on time going to the same place makes your story about weather sound like a lie @VirginAmerica #vx906
2766,2935,@AmericanAir 5th flight this year with you guys. all of them always delayed 1 hour or longer. or switching over planes. Just me or normal?
2771,2940,@AlaskaAir just paid out the ass in mileage on corner kicks lol #rctid #mls
2772,2941,@AmericanAir  as usual.. 3 different agents on the telephone. 3 differnt stories. Stuck in LV.
2775,2944,Have you thought @VirginAmerica that you should have just skipped resistive touch screens for Red? Experience stinks and negatively brand.
2789,2959,@DeltaAssist How can I reschedule flights online? I'm midair on DL1389 to DTW. and will likely miss my connection to DL0249. Please advise.
2794,2964,@SouthwestAir notice your tweets start off with sorry for the delay....
2798,2968,@JetBlue  I have a complaint
2803,2973,Thank you @jetblue for making it easy to change travel booked w points in lieu of a very sad situation. Phone agents were top notch.
2816,2988,@JetBlue Flt 71  JFK to SLC.   Running late.   Bummer.  - but leaving soon !
2824,2997,@VirginAmerica hi you may wanna see this horrible blog about you http://t.co/QRkhbzAZDG
2826,2999,another wonderful flight with @JetBlue seriously never flying another airline. such consistently kind staff!
2828,3001,Ticket bought. See you on Friday @AmericanAir.  Let's try not to mess this one up
2829,3002,Would have expected a little more assistance from @SouthwestAir when you are forced to stay overnight because their flight is late.
2840,3015,@VirginAmerica How is it this is not yet resolved after a month? Note the negative travel bank... http://t.co/eOpj1qnYmX
2843,3018,My first very bad @virginamerica experience. from security check to the flight.  With no info communicated to passengers at all.  #jfktolax
2844,3019,@AmericanAir flight delayed back to London. think the crew just want to finish watching this #NFLSunday game...
2854,3029,Thankful for @united Delayed flight. almost missed connecting. held connecting until we could get there. #ThankYou http://t.co/CZjqF26okH
2871,3046,"@DeltaAssist sorry to report another inconvenience! Flight 342 from atl to bna. Just informed immediately before boarding. ""No plane""!!!!!"
2878,3054,@JetBlue thanks for nothing. Entire 15 player team will no longer fly jetblue #nolongerflyingjetblue #southwest #lackofcustomerservice
2881,3057,@AlaskaAir does customer service right. 4 hours delayed and we received a proactive email apologizing with a $150 voucher. I'm impressed!!
2889,3065,"Just when I thought I'd make it home. another ""deplane with a mechanical problem"" on @AmericanAir. #willneverflywithjimevans"
2893,3070,@JetBlue Too bad the inflight entertainment crapped out after an hour. Went from ulta-mint to just so-so mint.
2909,3086,@DeltaAssist I understand weather is beyond your control but we do we have to wait 3 hrs for THIS plane
2917,3094,@DeltaAssist waiting on that follow 
2919,3096,@AmericanAir it looks like the last 400 tweets are all problems...please don't make me late tomorrow!!! Haha.
2941,3118,Missing Florida  @SouthwestAir http://t.co/uLF7BlrmEK
2952,3131,missing crew members. late starts and false boardings only to be pulled back in the terminal on @united at IAD
2954,3133,@DeltaAssist I'll be flying with you all on the 15th! Never had any problems. but nervous because I'm flying alone this time. 
2966,3145,@DeltaAssist need help getting my bag to me by tomorrow to Bay Area (SFO) bag ID DL729087. It seems to have missed my alternate flt to SMF
2975,3154,Flight back to London tomorrow... Had a sick two weeks in Cali! Let's hope I don't miss my connecting flight in Chicago - London @united
2982,3161,One day. just one day. I'd like to fly @SouthwestAir and not be delayed. Is that too much to ask? #NeverLeavingSFO
2984,3163,@DeltaAssist Hi traveling to Venice in nxt few wks. JFK FLT 474 seems to hve delayed dep's often.sometimes 2+hrs delayed. Any reason ? Tnks.
2988,3167,Husband is boiling mad. Our flight to LAX from SLC is 4 hours delayed. We'll miss our connecting to TUS. What's the deal. @SouthwestAir?
2994,3173,@SouthwestAir's new livery. Not bad! http://t.co/S2L8CU89YB
3003,3183,@VirginAmerica due to a delay on my flight from Amsterdam to San Fransisco. i'll miss flight 0908 to Las Vegas form 15:00. What to do?
3010,3190,I hate y'all. @SouthwestAir
3013,3193,Wonder why @SouthwestAir is having us sit on the tarmac in OAK.
3062,3244,@AmericanAir Big problem with your computers that means other airlines are shown one tier lower status on Oneworld!Why be loyal to AA?!
3071,3253,Least reliable = @VirginAmerica now stuck in the plane even tho we landed! #flyingissupposedtobefaster #terrible #3hrswasted
3073,3256,@united check with whom? Issue is still pending. Flight isn't until end of Oct.
3082,3265,How hard is it to plan the flight from SFO to LAX @VirginAmerica. Gonna cost me a cab ride b/c my ride couldnt wait for u to find a gate.
3094,3277,@JetBlue Very upset with the customer service I got from jet blue let me add they were the go to airline. On 9-3 I thought I booked a trip
3096,3279,Flew SMF-&gt;DTW on @united's new seats today. Rethinking my domestic frequent-flyer strategy. They're utterly horrid.
3097,3280,@united it's not. I have to rent a car and drive now. And no reason as to why the flight was delayed? Bummer
3100,3283,Flying delta today... I feel like in cheating on @AmericanAir
3124,3308,Massively irresponsible for @SouthwestAir to say to sideload discontinued Flash to use their TV service on Android. Huge security risks.
3127,3311,Off to Never Land @SouthwestAir http://t.co/iEJPgsAkgw
3130,3314,@united do you have a UK contact number. I have an issue to be discussed
3131,3315,Hey @AmericanAir here is my mobile boarding pass for connecting flight 4319 at Ohare. See a problem? #alwaysaproblem http://t.co/lOBUYzTU7Z
3134,3319,@SouthwestAir can't wait to travel this fall with you!  I wanna get away lol #rapidrewards :)
3135,3320,@DeltaAssist hello! Any luck getting in touch with paris airfrance lounge or lost &amp; found tied to paris/atl? White ipad mini with dark cover
3136,3321,@united if I paid for the extra leg room. it may be because I need it. #notcool
3138,3323,Planning my trips carefully so I dont choose US flights... So @AmericanAir doesnt punish me for their crappy routes on US planes
3139,3324,@united we both had a bad day!
3141,3326,Shout'n out @SouthwestAir for always taking care of / responding to issues. Oh and can't wait to hear about the big announcement ;) #Salute
3152,3337,Up: @jetblue for letting me on the 9:15 flight back to HOU after I missed my first. Down: Boston's horrendous morning traffic.
3163,3348,Oh. @JetBlue. a rare fail. It would have been nice to know that the seat for which I paid extra does not recline.
3165,3350,@united I'm more concerned w the willingness of 1 of your staff to lie and unwillingness of other staff to apologize or offer amends
3173,3358,@SouthwestAir can you cancel flights on your new website? I don't see the tab to allow me to do that anymore.
3179,3364,New airplane paint? New ad campaign? We don't know. We're waiting for the @SouthwestAir event http://t.co/Uj9W2Eeigx
3186,3371,standing room only in the @southwestair hangar waiting for the big announcement! #swalife__ http://t.co/NGBJy1k8nc
3187,3373,@SouthwestAir Waiting to get to the Heart of the matter! #SouthwestHeart http://t.co/cNpfbNG5Qn
3189,3375,@united feeling let down by you guys today. 1K status. but my seat was given away. Any chance for WiFi and coffee at club while I wait?
3196,3383,@SouthwestAir   Signed in and waiting to hear or see the big announcement. _ working for SWA!
3219,3408,@SouthwestAir what a disappointment.
3225,3414,@SouthwestAir the red belly was iconic. really sad to see it go
3226,3415,@SouthwestAir Swing and a miss
3227,3416,@SouthwestAir new paint looks like a 737 advertising laundry soap was flying through the sky and got a bag of fritos stuck on the tail.
3231,3420,@united Indeed but strict interpretation of 'one-time pass'means I would have to stay in Club some 8-9 hours awaiting connecting UA 82flight
3244,3435,@united - VERY unhappy at your DSM decision today. This 1K customer may be moving to Delta.
3246,3438,Sad to see the current Southwest livery go away. It was one of my all-time favorites. @SouthwestAir
3249,3441,@united Got em late last night_. working and will get laundry done tonight - meds got over heated and can not be used so I will file a claim
3250,3442,I am e-yelling at @JetBlue for poor service during my wedding trip for their crappy flight attendant. I am an adult.
3262,3456,@VirginAmerica See you on Sep 18th. BOS to LAX. Can't wait
3266,3460,Feelin the new @SouthwestAir livery! Can't wait to see it in person! http://t.co/OVc3AfTDBI

3281,3476,@SouthwestAir Oooooooh!!! I like the new look! Can't wait for a chance to fly with it!
3290,3487,LUVing the new @SouthwestAir look! Can't wait to see the new #SouthwestHeart livery in person. http://t.co/XddgtiCLml
3291,3488,Made it!!!!! Thank you @VirginAmerica for the amazing service! Would have missed my flight! #FirstClass #AlwaysOnPoint _
3292,3490,Hey @united  -- what's best phone number to call for lost and found??
3294,3493,@united Oh. That's odd. http://t.co/0cqnOdivOZ wasn't displaying the image but it is now. Apologies. issue on my end it seems!
3297,3496,I wish @AmericanAir service didn't suck. their planes are some of best looking!
3298,3497,@JetBlue Howits possible make up and other items that were in protective casing ended up damaged. Do u throw bags against walls b4 loading?
3300,3499,@DeltaAssist I am looking to speak to someone about getting a voucher. I filled out a complaint form online but would like to speak on phone
3304,3503,@deltaassist miles from my 8/28 trip still havent posted to my account after multiple calls to the platinum desk. How much longer?
3307,3506,I am very. very upset at @SouthwestAir's logo change.
3322,3521,@SouthwestAir Your insane prices must be a cost of the redesign. LAX to PHX for $340? NUTS NUTS NUTS. So nuts in fact. I'm driving instead!
3324,3523,@SouthwestAir going to miss the orange. the yellow a bit to lemon
3326,3525,@SouthwestAir Hideous. kill it with fire.
3340,3540,@SouthwestAir is killing the flight industry game. Loooove your rebrand! #SouthwestHeart
3344,3544,@AmericanAir another flight. another plane unfit for travel. another delay. Platinum status going. going...gone. #aasucks
3345,3545,First time flying @VirginAmerica and all I can say is I can't wait to fly with them again #HighlyRecommended
3346,3546,I would comment on how bad @SouthwestAir wifi is but this tweet likely won't go through!  Waste of money!
3350,3550,@united Not a single flight on our concourse has left on time. Two of them with mechanical issues. Are any of your flights on time?
3357,3558,@SouthwestAir I am LUVing the new look!!  I can't wait to fly with y'all again!  (hopefully soon!)
3371,3573,At our event 10 years ago @SouthwestAir announced it was no longer _passionately neutral_ about the #WrightAmendment http://t.co/kJTAdfSMku
3376,3578,had most things done so early for #nnden14 that @americanair decided to mess with my flight. the usual way. Make me leave early x 2 #nchat
3380,3582,Stuck at the gate for my @virginamerica flight home. I just need us to get in the air so I can be on my way to work. #stressed
3381,3583,@JetBlue If I no show for my outbound flight. is my return still valid or does the whole ticket cancel?  Thanks.
3384,3586,The new @SouthwestAir paint is okay. Im just not a huge fan of the logo text. It looks messy.
3389,3591,@united - ridiculous lines through Customs and Security for International at IAD!!  Lots of passengers about to miss flights!!
3392,3594,@SouthwestAir First time flying Southwest. Delayed arriving in Vegas and Delayed leaving Vegas. #Nightmare
3393,3595,Apparently I should have waited until I got on the plane to have lunch. I love @JetBlue #CiaoLA http://t.co/gAk5jYqc3A
3394,3596,Sorely disappointed to board @JetBlue and see I'm not on a new plane. #notahappycamper
3395,3598,Had I waited to book my @SouthwestAir flights I could have saved liked 90 bucks round trip. wish I would have known :(
3396,3599,@VirginAmerica what the heck guys why no more direct flights from LAX to PHL what the actual heck
3403,3607,@AmericanAir  I miss having more flights out of STL. Where to go? #ImissTWA
3406,3610,Missed my flight already. had to go here fast n chillax @united http://t.co/ZxiLAS3XT6
3408,3613,A lil delayed going back home @SouthwestAir darn weather :(
3411,3617,@SouthwestAir had a huge problem yesterday . Where can I contact . I'm very loyal to SW but idk if I can be anymore
3413,3619,@VirginAmerica it's not a completely bad experience. Just wish I didn't have to wait it out at LAS.
3414,3620,Why are my flights always delayed? Maybe I shouldn't complain/expect so much. @SouthwestAir
3421,3628,Boarding @VirginAmerica . they said _your pilot will tell you the updated arrival time once you__re on board_ That sounds like a trap !
3422,3629,One question for the person who stole my credit card number: Where is @united Airlines taking you for $2100? #notcool
3433,3641,@DeltaAssist seeking comforts here DL 281 delay due to mechanical reason. Had two rebooks already today. last Msp-hkg trip was hassling too
3435,3643,_@SouthwestAir: no one cares about the new color palette. we care about the best prices which yall no longer have!!! #annoyed #alwaysdelays
3436,3644,"Apparently @AmericanAir are working on their ""carpet issue"" and have 15 passengers with connecting flights to Prague. The plot thickens..."
3437,3645,@united really trying to stay loyal to your airline but this isn't working for me. Two days in a row. Delayed because of crew.Time to change
3444,3654,Love it @virginamerica is amazing - bags waiting &amp; boom out the door!
3446,3656,Hi @VirginAmerica what the hell is with your employees blasting music into entire terminals that don't belong to Virgin?
3449,3659,Ohhhhh @SouthwestAir why must all your flights be delayed today?! #LeSigh #AirportsAreAnnoying
3450,3660,@DeltaAssist stuck in security line at JFK term 2 with 4 other passengers on 6:48 Portland flight. Pls don't let it leave w/out us!
3455,3665,Switched to an earlier flight on @JetBlue and they didn't even charge a change fee. _you guys 4eva
3456,3666,@SouthwestAir I hate retro. I was hoping we you go with a modern blanket of color
3466,3677,@AlaskaAir no offense but the new app kind of sucks. Info is rarely current.
3468,3679,While the plane is delayed. any chance @AlaskaAir can create some local beer partnerships? Have Seattle wine and liquor connections.
3469,3680,@JetBlue no TV on the flight?! Not good!!! #VERYunhappycamper
3471,3682,People watching and working on gift card contracts while waiting for my @JetBlue flight. Hope it's on time! http://t.co/UNODaRroAv
3474,3685,@JetBlue I arrive on the 24th of April but leave on the 1st of May! When can I book my airfare?! 
3476,3687,@united I understand but when your number is in the system it shouldn't be a problem. Definitely a TSA issue and not you guys.
3481,3692,I like @SouthwestAir New Look! Not bad
3482,3693,@united Your flights are always delayed. hot. and you force passengers to watch advertisements. I feel like a detainee. not a customer.
3492,3703,@SouthwestAir I LUV IT! Can't wait to see it in person!
3508,3721,@jetblue ... Hates #skateboarders
3509,3722,I don't care for the new @SouthwestAir livery. but I'll just get used to it. Can't wait for the next design!

3566,3781,@JetBlue the jack was a little faulty
3567,3782,Cant wait to sit on a six hour plane ride to LA. working on my college apps with my bff's @JetBlue _
3570,3786,@AmericanAir : Yes. However. other airline's baggage claims are much faster. The big upset is the 30 to 40 min flight delay for no reason.
3578,3796,both my boyfriend's flights with @united on the way home and back have been delayed. i can't rely on them getting anywhere on time.
3589,3808,Hey @SouthwestAir when will y'all be hiring FAs to the public? I know internal is happening. but I have been waiting YEARS public hire _

3841,4075,@VirginAmerica Shame it's not possible to reserve a rewards flight and then move Amex miles over to cover. Other airlines let you do this.
3849,4083,"Hey @AmericanAir . 62.5k miles and 500 bucks spent in addition to years of loyalty only gets me a 50 buck ""favor""? Disappointed."
3858,4093,@united what's with this BS. I'm on the plane. wasn't late. There's a fuel issue delaying us after FAA hold. http://t.co/eT2Qs0N9As

5380,5715,@AlaskaAir very poor service in first class from IAH--&gt;SEA on Friday. Sept. 12. Shockingly poor.
5385,5720,@DeltaAssist I need a phone number for Delta baggage at the Roanoke airport. We have a delayed bag we are looking for.
5386,5721,@AmericanAir I hate you
5395,5732,@SouthwestAir flt 4073 to bwi plane steering not working .i work tonight &amp; am not being given any info on expected delay. No answers. Urgent
5401,5738,@SouthwestAir Now just work on getting those bad boys off the ground on time.
5410,5748,Narrowly avoided a financial bait &amp; switch on @VirginAmerica. thanks to Stacy in customer service.  #AlwaysAskForTheSupervisor.
5418,5756,Poor @AmericanAir
5421,5759,I had two flights yesterday with @VirginAmerica and they time and time again prove all other airlines are terrible. #OnTimeSFO #FreeTV
5422,5760,Trying to watch a movie @AmericanAir ! Your constant interrupting for announcements is all sorts of annoying.
5426,5764,Some days we don't forget - http://t.co/zK4tuxMmwg__t-forget/ #SayNoToRacism #Sikhs - Shame on you @AmericanAir
5429,5767,@AmericanAir 40 minute delay to add fuel when we r going to a city where the sun is shining?  #why????
5449,5787,Of course. last flight of last trip of season is cancelled. Luckily @AlaskaAir redeemed themselves in pdx the next day. #home #family
5457,5795,Richard Branson failed to deliver on $3bn #ClimateChange  pledge #RenewableEnergy  #auspol @VirginAmerica   http://t.co/Qz3xFPmood
5458,5796,Why are airlines so difficult to deal with?  Still trying to get home from Arkansas.  Feeling like @AmericanAir just doesn't seem to care 
5464,5802,@united I realize kids must travel. But. they do it w/o me screaming at them.  Also. I pay for my seat. babies don't. #childfreeflights
5475,5814,can't wait to go to Saint Lucia on @AmericanAir next year February!
5481,5821,Only thing better than @United forgetting my duffle on the way there is them forgetting both my bikes on return trip. Yay for inconvenience!
5483,5823,.@SouthwestAir how are we going to survive the flight when all these jokes are KILLING

5512,5853,@SouthwestAir I miss the honey roasted peanuts :(
5515,5856,Gotta LUV @SouthwestAir: instead of making you wait on hold. they call you back when the next agent is available.
5522,5863,Have traveled around the world w/out issue the past month. Until we fly @AmericanAir. How do you leave the gate w/ an incorrect pax manifest
5524,5865,@JetBlue trying to cancel my flight for Oct and no one picking up. What number do I call?
5529,5871,@AlaskaAir I just feel bad for your flight attendants trying to do their jobs and all of us who brought small bags. GIANT bags!
5537,5879,@AmericanAir very disappointed in what happened in the plane today #NotAccpetable
5546,5888,@DeltaAssist I wanted to switch to a later flight tomorrow but they are saying I can't even tho there are seats available.
5548,5891,@JetBlue Your in-air ads are interrupting my golf. That's not cool in Mint. Other than that. things are good.
5555,5899,Seems every time I fly @united headed east. there's a mechanical/flight crew issue.
5598,5944,@deltaassist If I placed one of my two last names in The middle name section for my boarding pass will that be a problem? :(
5600,5946,.@AlaskaAir Y U CANCEL MY FLIGHT?!?!
5601,5947,Supported @AmericanAir for  37 years -so sad to say this airline is not the same as it once was. Unfortunately i have 5 more flts this year
5610,5957,@JetBlue I just booked a flight for me &amp; another but I added their middle name then forgot to add mine. is it too late to edit the mistake?
5617,5965,@DeltaAssist Round 2. Sadly my second morning visit is equally unpleasant. U should train your staff to acknowledge ppl in front of them.
5626,5975,Last time I fly @AmericanAir  #worstairline
5630,5982,@VirginAmerica why must I wait for a seat? Doesn't 15k miles in 2 mths get a lady a seat? #1stworldprobs
5631,5983,$120 to switch to a flight leaving the same time to a place 45 miles away from my destination? This is why I fly @SouthwestAir
5635,5987,@JetBlue The sparrows trapped in your JFK terminal are starting to remind me of a Tom Hanks movie...can you guys find a way to free them?
5637,5989,Le sigh. 7:30 am flt 953 is now a ?:?? departure. I have a tight connection that's even tighter now. @SouthwestAir here's hoping I make it.
5640,5992,@united _____  very bad!
5641,5993,@SouthwestAir Luv and miss you. Colleen!
5663,6015,@deltaassist on hold for 30 minutes on sky miles 800 number! Trying to change flight.  What the heck??
5664,6016,@AmericanAir I am loving this turn around you all are putting on! Cant wait for the future! #AAforlife
5667,6019,@united needs to learn how to organize lines. Groups 1 and 2 in one line defeats purpose. Plus. I feel bad for GS guys who have to wait. ORD
5669,6022,Very disappointed with @AmericanAir today. We fly several times a year but will be sure to fly a friendlier airline. #americanairlines
5674,6027,FML. i missed my flight s/o to @SouthwestAir for getting me on another flight. #gonnabealongday
5677,6030,Guess ya can't have everything; lost personal space on these new planes . but we have power for our devices @AlaskaAir #crammedincoach
5680,6033,Kicking off day 2! And sending a shout out to. @united. this year's host of #ACPC! http://t.co/CgM4NB1yOD
5685,6039,.@AlaskaAir YOUR AIRLINE IS FUCKING GARBAGE
5687,6041,@AlaskaAir what kind of reimbursement do you have for cancelled flights + baggage past 20min? Not happy right meow.
5691,6045,Props to @united for having directv on my flight! It'll give me just enough time to see the dallas cowboys suck. #cowboys
5701,6055,Never again @AlaskaAir - NEVER
5706,6061,$150 for extra legroom on my 5 1/2 flight to LAX is insane. How do you expect someone who is 6'5 to fit in 32inches of space. @VirginAmerica
5710,6066,Traveling with a toddler can be stressful but it's ok..@DeltaAssist have a 29-44 minute hold time to answer your question. Come on guys.
5711,6068,@VirginAmerica love your service. but please discontinue serving catfood tuna in cans - it kills everyone's nostrils up here #VRD351
5712,6069,@VirginAmerica what is the number to lost &amp; found? my dad lost his cellphone on the flight &amp; I'd like to check to see if they found it.
5721,6079,@united standing in Queue for 533 to Chicago and no one is telling us  why we have been waiting to board the plane. Bad customer service!!!
5723,6081,Waiting on my @AmericanAir flight. Depart in 7 min and the board still says on time. Guess they expect to board fast...
5728,6087,Headed to Arrowhead microbial genomics conf #LAMG14 and @AmericanAir cancel CMI-ORD flight `due to weather'? http://t.co/FkXItEsPGx
5739,6098,Oh @united. Why do I even bother anymore? http://t.co/xhQkhqZ62q
5743,6102,Hate @JetBlue! Flight cancelled. can't get out until tomorrow and now I'm gonna miss an important work meeting! #jetblue #travelfail
5757,6117,@SouthwestAir There's a flight path over my house in #SWPhx. Can't wait to see one of your new birds soaring overhead. #planejunkie
5767,6127,@AmericanAir Your ROBLOX mimic isn't doing that bad either! We're currently the 2nd largest aviation group on ROBLOX! http://t.co/oiK8gZvKZk
5788,6148,@AlaskaAir So disappointed that I had to PAY money to cancel a flight.
5803,6165,@JetBlue delay and loud passengers was a bummer but thanks for the flight credit!
5806,6168,@DeltaAssist they have no suggestions or ideas on how long this will take. I have to be back for an exam tomorrow. I am very stressed out...
5810,6172,WiFi from FAR to DOG: just tried to switch devices and it appears the @united programmers missed the input field for the verification code.
5811,6173,Just watched a @SouthwestAir employee get kicked off our plane in Orlando. No AC . I fanned a kid in front of me to quit crying. #Waytoohot
5813,6175,@united that moment when you try to help a guy and united won't let you. and acts like it was your fault #Oyvey
5822,6184,"I have a $300 @AmericanAir voucher I HAVE to use in the next month.  Any suggestions on where I should go?  Don't say ""Hell"" -_- #assholes"
5824,6186,Hey @AmericanAir funny how you cancel my flight for _weather_ but reposition the plane anyway. IFR flight plans don__t lie.
5825,6187,@united again you fail me with inability to be on time sure better hope I make it across the pond on my flight tonight or all hell is coming
5826,6188,@DeltaAssist in cabo san lucas. Flight tomorrow still shows OK. When would the decision be made to cancel and move pass angers to Tue flts
5829,6191,@SouthwestAir still waiting for the day when I login and scream my lungs out seeing your name in my followers list _
5844,6206,@SouthwestAir hate to see money wasted on plane decorations
5845,6207,What does @SouthwestAir have against regional jets? Why would you waste the fuel on a 737 for a short flight? #bizarrecommericals
5854,6218,Loving that my Jets are on while I wait for my flight. Love you @JetBlue #jetbluejfk
5861,6225,@VirginAmerica I always fly virgin but recently had a bad experience.My seat and seat tray was extremely dirty and was covered in chocolate
5862,6226,I seriously don't know why I fly @united. My flights always late and my layovers are always too short
5866,6230,"@jetblue Special thanks to your stewardess. Kyle. who helped me wrestle my carry-on overhead.  ""No problem."" She said and smiled"
5868,6232,@AmericanAir dream job. I remember seeing these mad dogs at #PSP as a kid. Can I fly them please? http://t.co/VSSFw4NjYr
5869,6234,@DeltaAssist I have a problem with my flight (5168) to go Atlanta. Is that correspondence is guaranteed to Paris?
5871,6236,Hi @JetBlue I'd like to cancel a flight to Arizona I reserved for February
5878,6243,@DeltaAssist I got separated from my husband at LAX and he missed our flight. I land in 2 hrs. Any way to check if he's on next flight?
5881,6246,Really @SouthwestAir?! You're seriously gonna let people hold seats for others? Ruins the whole open seating thing. huh? #screwyou
5888,6253,Stuck in security line at ATL. @DeltaAssist can you let our plane know?
5892,6257,"My @united flight to DC just got cancelled. Reason? ""Crew availability issue."" At O'Hare? Biggest United hub? #Gottabekiddin'"
5897,6262,Never taking @VirginAmerica after that _
5898,6263,@JetBlue why can't i book travel to Martinique (FDF)? It's listed as a destination but no flights are available? http://t.co/c10KxVqjGN
5899,6264,RIP Paul Angle. Your @SouthwestAir family Will miss you!!! Especially Team BDL!!!
5900,6265,@AmericanAir You took off on flight 1142 without my father who missed the flight because of security wait times! Definitely a bad decision.
5902,6267,Why does @SouthwestAir always say they're inexpensive yet every time I look they never are?
5906,6271,"@jetblue maybe it's just me. but when I try to contact you via the website and click ""Contact Us"" .select ""True Blue Program"" not working"
5926,6291,just experienced some really odd logic by @SouthwestAir. was hoping to get a flight booked with them today. but they want me to wait a week?
5928,6293,@VirginAmerica having a terrible experience with your airline today.
5930,6295,So what happens if I miss my connection and I'm on the last flight of the day- if it is the airline's fault @united ?
5953,6318,@SouthwestAir saw this while waiting to board my plane from from SMF to LAS...she laid in there for at least 5 mins. http://t.co/1WBkpauiDl
5956,6321,Plane spotting from Alki. Hard to miss the @AlaskaAir Eskimo in the sky.

6034,6405,@DeltaAssist mechanical problems on flight 2226 today is no way to start a Monday.
6043,6414,@AlaskaAir very disappointed with your customer service today. Not a great way to start the morning.

6051,6422,@AlaskaAir I travel each week from PDX to SMF on #2565; 3 of last 4 weeks we are delayed; this matters to me.
6053,6424,Thought I would fly @United to see if their service is as bad as it's purported to be: it is #unitedbreaksguitars

6101,6473,I can't wait for @AmericanAir to retire these MD-80s. Always a mechanical delay and trying to find maintenance in DFW is nearly impossible.

7316,7753,@JetBlue Any news on why Flt 265 from SMF to LB is delayed 3 hrs? Thx.

7779,8233,@DeltaAssist I had to switch flights with little notice. Any way to find out if my luggage followed me?
7781,8235,@AmericanAir you need to change offload procedure at D2 in LGA. Logistically laughable and repeatedly inconvenient.

10990,11611,@united you missed the point....http://t.co/6z7rOm9zYu - same concept applies
10992,11613,@AmericanAir ok. I am at EZE. Can you put me in first class to make it up for your issues ?
10996,11617,I swear to god I will NEVER fly you again @AmericanAir if I miss my connecting to ORL to HP World because YOU over-booked the plane. Fuckers
11005,11626,So it could be worse.  I could be at O'Hare hanging out at @united terminal waiting for craziness of the day to sort itself out.  Oh. wait..
11012,11633,So at @united damages my bag then has the audacity to say oh we don't cover those damages.

11925,12591,Family trip to AZ cancelled due to control tower issue. @SouthwestAir refunded our fare and we have rescheduled our trip for April.
11927,12593,Philly?  _@VirginAmerica: We hate to see you go. but we love to watch you leave. #Sunday http://t.co/8xtDoaC7Bp_
11936,12603,I f'ing HATE @SouthwestAir . Sitting on plane in Orlando with no G*ddamn air conditioning. Let us back in the terminal!!! #southwestairlines
11948,12615,The last 4 flights I've taken on @VirginAmerica have been delayed by over 45 mins. Not a good look.
11951,12618,@united can't wait!! ____
11958,12625,@AmericanAir I have been on hold for 27 mins. Wait time was supposed to be 6 mins. stop apologizing and PICK UP!
11959,12626,I have never been on a @SouthwestAir flight that both boarded and took off on time....
11968,12636,@SouthwestAir Is it too late to add my known traveler # for a flight I am taking later tonight?
11978,12648,@AlaskaAir thanks for getting me home early...thanks NOT for a 45 min wait for an open gate. #thissucks
11985,12655,Landed at BWI on @AlaskaAir after a long non-stop routing from SEA that went over Kansas. due to Chicago FAA damage. An hour more to read.
11993,12663,Big shoutout to @JetBlue for having me miss my intramural flag football game tonight. Y'all really let my team tonight #thanks
11994,12664,@SouthwestAir oh and a 45 minute delay today is not my day is it.
11997,12667,And what's worse is in a few days I'll be making gold 75k on @AlaskaAir - except now they've become just as soulless as every other airline
11998,12668,@AmericanAir You guys need to have more people working at LIT.  2 people at the desk with 23 people waiting.
12015,12685,Had to switch airlines after all Chicago flights were grounded Fri-I miss @SouthwestAir-there is no comparison! Non-SWA trips are sad... :(
12022,12693,Washed a guy leave his 10yr olds in the terminal so he could block seats on @SouthwestAir 1359 only to be outdone by lady blocking 3 rows
12034,12706,@DeltaAssist give number I can call. Now they told him he needed to book his own flight tomorrow to LSE from MSP. Delta is fucking this up!
12041,12713,@AmericanAir 2323. This seems to be a common problem. several trips I've had to tweet or fb my displeasure. No respect for my time or $$
12048,12720,@SouthwestAir at Atlanta and our plane at gate C7 has no air because the external AC is not working. Flt 262. Not too comfortable.
12056,12728,@JetBlue please add a Boston to Atlanta route! Delta stinks. #mosaic
12057,12729,excuse me @SouthwestAir I was suppose to be on my flight and on my way home to Chicago! #wah

12102,12779,How long past my callback time should I wait for @AmericanAir 800 number to call me before I try calling again? #help
12105,12783,@united question: if I end up around 180 miles short of the next premier level do you guys ever round off or do I need to wait until next?
12113,12791,"@AmericanAir Refunds site says ""You have encountered an error. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Please try again later."""
12119,12799,@united I'd be your best friend if you told them to hold the DEN-&gt;LAX flight tonight at 1012pm. I'm coming from IND now and delayed til 1027
12128,12808,Ugh. not liking @VirginAmerica's new-ish website. Much easier to see prices and options on the old version. #sad
12138,12818,I fly @SouthwestAir a lot and always have high praise but this is not the case.  You screwed up and I'm pissed.
12148,12828,@DeltaAssist It's my husband. I'm waiting to pick him up at his final destination. We know the status. It's delayed. ATL to BHM.
12151,12831,@DeltaAssist is Ok.  Im not really upset.  I just wanted to fly more comfortably
12152,12832,@SouthwestAir Your my #1 pick! I flew Un**** &amp; Amer**** to Puerto Rico. last week to Las Vegas on All****** Charges for bags are ridiculous!
12166,12849,@united Honolulu is a disaster. 2 planes board and deplane later still waiting to fly to Guam. Total travel time of 24+ hrs from D.C.
12178,12861,Shuttle dropped me at the wrong terminal. @AlaskaAir check-in issues. free TSA massage. gate change!... https://t.co/Kqc3i9S8UB
12185,12868,Always a @united airlines Zone 3 and never a Zone 1.
12187,12870,@JetBlue thanks for the super long delay in Seattle!
12201,12884,@SouthwestAir needs to stop playing games. and allow dogs to fly as cargo.
12202,12885,@united what's wrong with your ground service at San Francisco . How can I complaint by email ?
12206,12889,@SouthwestAir--I'm very mad at you.
12208,12891,@jetblue 1/6 Tonight I was on Flight 1106 &amp; flight crew. Rodney &amp; Abad were fantastic. We took off 1 hr late due to control tower arson
12212,12895,@united this was another chance after 2 previous problems recorded with you guys. 3 strikes your out!

12220,12903,I am never flying to Chicago. You guys lost my raid friend! @SouthwestAir

12284,12970,@AmericanAir do you know when the decision was made to cancel this morning? I am only asking b/c I need to plan alts. ahead. time sensitive
12291,12978,@United. flights do get cancelled but its all how its dealt with.  Hoping that after 12 hrs of ineptitude CUN to SFO gets in the air
12295,12982,@DeltaAssist looking for alternatives to dl4725 trying to get to okc from DLH current DLH to msp delayed
12298,12985,@united You clearly dont understand frustration because youve been this incredibly terrible for years.
12303,12990,@AmericanAir doesn't matter. Won't be flying aa again. #terribleservice
12306,12994,@VirginAmerica Your flight safety video is so bad and so obnoxious that it's unbelievably upsetting. 
12308,12996,NYC for a while. Gonna miss home but duty calls  @SouthwestAir
12310,12998,Against my better judgment I flew @united today. Yeah. 2 hour delay in Chicago. What's happened to this airline?

12329,13018,@united TBD - we're thinking the Caribbean in late fall to warm up. Do you have suggestions?
12339,13028,@AlaskaAir I would expect a service industry to have back up plans for those situations. so as not to inconvenience customers
12343,13032,Stuck in the USA. cost me $500. No compensation yet. What up @united? #unitedfail
12345,13034,I hate you @united with the heat of 1.000 suns.

12428,13123,Hi @DeltaAssist. I submitted a lost item report yesterday regarding a bag I lost at LGA &amp; today it was FOUND!  :)  Can you cancel my report?
12444,13139,@VirginAmerica what about bats? They've been around longer than balloons. And squirrels? Sugar gliders?
12451,13147,Once again @united . IMPRESSIVELY bad. Always such a roll of the dice flying with you turds.
12464,13161,@united Paid first class ticket kicked to economy and 10 people were upgraded to first class?! Demanding full refund http://t.co/7AiiiuimQX
12470,13168,New record (for me) - 23 wheelchairs waiting to greet a @JetBlue flight landing at FLL! Wow. I'm thinking we won't be boarding on time...
12471,13169,@JetBlue your team on the ground and in the air missed the mark on this one last night (BOS-LAX). Letter to come... http://t.co/jqeqIVGd3t

12482,13181,Never see an airline have an intro video but @SouthwestAir pulled it off. Nicely done.    http://t.co/IDO2kVJ5R5
12483,13182,@VirginAmerica you have the best planes and some of the rudest flight attendants.
12486,13185,@JetBlue hotspot at JFK is killing me right now

12500,13199,@jetblue it would seem your airline is utterly unprepared for lost luggage.
12508,13209,Not going to lie. I feel like a #Baller with my @SouthwestAir #AList status #MoneyTeam
12513,13214,@DeltaAssist there is a seat available that completely cancels out the comfort reason I booked this seat. Fly every week and have bad knees
12516,13218,Boarded and ready to fly back from #Maui to #Seattle. I never get why @AlaskaAir has Che Guevara on their planes. http://t.co/GUdw87xl5Y
12520,13222,It wouldn't be @united without a delay or cancelation. Why do I fly with this airline? I ask myself_ http://t.co/RUOkj6Ld6H

12530,13233,"Hey @southwestair We'd &lt;3 to go home. Not so thankful to the ""cust service rep"" who rescheduled our flt through Chicago so we're stuck agn"
12532,13235,@DeltaAssist and sad to see that it was not the case. Even though it's a shoulder injury she should be able to fly comfortably not suffer

12602,13306,@JetBlue catering to Boston on a JFK-LAX route? Terrible branding...
12605,13309,Ok I'm at #LAX unfortunately @VirginAmerica delayed my flight :( but I'm here now so it's ok had a bad experience with TSA but its all good
12615,13319,@united Seriously! It was chaos and she never lost her composure!  She just calmly navigated the storm and got things done!
12621,13327,@united-Flew home for a friends funeral.Agent misinformed me over the phone.Online complaint hasn't been replied to. http://t.co/j75tCG3iCN
12634,13342,@VirginAmerica Thank you for getting me the hell out of #vegas
12635,13343,@united for a 7am flight out of ORD. how much in advance will UA know if it is cancelled? Trying to give myself best shot of getting out
12656,13367,Ability to watch House of Cards on @United flights has almost convinced me that they're not the worst airline in the world. Almost.
12659,13370,@AmericanAir both flight i flew today had delays. Crew membes are lost on another terminal LOL.
12680,13393,@AlaskaAir I Read Ya Guys Are Letting People's Dogs &amp; Pets Die In Your Planes. Slow Painful Deaths Too. Y'all Are About To Lose My Business.
12681,13394,Finally @united tell me they are looking into my complaint &amp; I'm to allow 30 days for full research. I shall report back.. To be continued

12717,13433,@united .FAA and other airlines should not take such as minor issues and just let it pass. What if the fool does it again? World Peace

13784,14566,@SouthwestAir none of my flights since June have left on time. and today we leave in 20 minutes and the plane's not even here. What gives?!
13786,14568,@AmericanAir why do you wait till I'm the plane to announce delay. Happens often. I know they knew before boarding. This is getting old.
13787,14569,@AmericanAir #1267 and this merger was the worst thing that could have happened for AA. Shouldn't have stuck by you all these years
13794,14576,@DeltaAssist where can I email a complaint? The web form is not compatible with my mobile phone.
13795,14577,Cool fingerprint boarding tech on display by @AlaskaAir. Can't wait end reliance on boarding passes and my dying phone battery. #gwsummit
13800,14582,Not our best @VirginAmerica experience. but not their fault. Cranky baby; rough skies; bad weather means rerouting &amp; extending flight an hr
13804,14586,How did I know that our @united flight would be delayed?  Hmm. maybe because they always are.
13809,14591,@DeltaAssist can you check on switching flights for me from10 October - 9 November ?
13816,14598,I swear every time I fly my flight is delayed... I'm looking at you @united
13821,14604,@AmericanAir and was not able to board the plane because of it. the time I flew with you guys before. you cancelled me off of my flight
13822,14605,@SouthwestAir lost by bike box and then showed up w/ it day later w/ horribly damaged bike and parts! All I want to do is race.
13823,14606,Oh @SouthwestAir. you have made me miss connection in Nassau. but you tell me it's not your prob. #nothappywithsouthwest
13824,14607,.@VirginAmerica I hope yall  fly out of New Orleans one day. I get sad flying other airlines 
13826,14609,@DeltaAssist no need for you to inflict more damage. Already missing the pre-wedding dinner. Will be finding a new airline.
13830,14613,All I want to do is go home but ty @SouthwestAir for never having flights leave on time :-)
13832,14615,Looks like our delay on @AlaskaAir to LAX is going to cost us our flight to Copenhagen on Norwegian.... bummer.. next flight isn't till Sat
13836,14619,@VirginAmerica discontinues flights to PHL on October 6th. My heart is broken.
13842,14625,Even More Speed option with @JetBlue was a good choice right now. JFK security line is insane.
13850,14633,"@DeltaAssist Close to 2 hours delay with my flight tonight :( can you throw some ""we're sorry"" points my way?"
13854,14637,#TBT 2 when @VirginAmerica safety vid song was in my #flashmob proposal!! Cnt wait 2send them vid. I _ that song/airline &amp;my fiance!
13864,14647,@SouthwestAir why are all southwest flights cancelled out if Chicago but everyone else is flying??
13871,14655,@AmericanAir We didn__t have too many (if any) around here. but all of our plants are sad. Lost a couple for sure.
13872,14656,@AmericanAir: Weather in DFW - yup stuck in it! Looks line late to atl tonight  http://t.co/QVui8zgLK2 http://t.co/3T0gSuE2B5

13918,14704,@DeltaAssist yes flights cancelled all over Chicago. I really want them to be recognized in the front desk.
13927,14713,@JetBlue will not give me satisfaction for mislabeled and subsequent lost baggage that had many valuables in it AND I AM PISSED about it!
13928,14714,@SouthwestAir Why did you cancel all the flights from MDW to SFO today? And no way to rebook? Your wait time is ridiculous...
13930,14716,I will never use @AmericanAir again!! They just cancel flights not caring who they screw over in the process!! #notok #americanairlines
13934,14720,@united friends stuck at ORD trying to go to TYS. Any help?
13949,14735,Omg. There's a guy who is a Chairman member (!!) on @AmericanAir who wasn't upgraded. He's adorably angry. Premium Econ is roomy enough
13950,14736,On a non @VirginAmerica flight after a whole year _ I hate it ... Help ___

14138,14935,@VirginAmerica if you order a beer through the screen. any chance it can be delivered earlier? If you're in the back you still have to wait
14139,14936,I love flying @JetBlue but I hate the fact that I can't change my seat from my iPhone on the mobile site. full site or app! Because Flash.

14908,15758,@AlaskaAir Missed opportunity with Flight 688 today.  We had to switch planes &amp; gates &amp; now leaving late. but no apologies from agents/crew.
14915,15765,@JetBlue I'm sure.  Doesn't change the fact that we are all stuck on this plane.
14921,15771,That landing was not the pilot's fault. or the flight attendant's fault. It was the as-phalt. @SouthwestAir pilot after bumpy touch-down.

14991,15850,I'm just so dissatisfied with my last experience with @SouthwestAir usually my airline of choice but not sure if that'll continue :(
15000,15860,@DeltaAssist Yep.  Expedited for tomorrow morning. We connected from A24 to A25 without issue but seems bags didn't make it.
15001,15861,@DeltaAssist Ended up on that flt bc flt tonight had mech problem and I had to rebook - wasn't going to make my connection in ATL tonight
15014,15874,Best/worst: walking the damn Rhapsody in Blue neon tunnel btwn B &amp; C gates at @united ORD terminal. Feels like home slash totes annoying.
15025,15885,three kids. late flight. Thanks for being #familyfriendly @JetBlue
15029,15889,@AmericanAir now I am stuck in Dallas overnight on your dime. I could have been home for my birthday and saved you a bit of money too (2/2)

15049,15909,A 40 minute delay from Detroit with a connection = only 20 minutes late to Nashville. @SouthwestAir is the best.

15062,15922,@DeltaAssist now i'm in mexico city and my luggage in atlanta... You guys are the worst...

15136,15999,Ahh @VirginAmerica I love how you are playing my favourite cold play song while waiting to be checked in
15142,16006,Love having the @AlaskaAir app for Android. Switched seats last minute before boarding and got the perfect seat. :)
15143,16007,@AmericanAir is this a joke? What can I do with $50 after being mistreated by your poorly trained staff http://t.co/wikCKgvkAA
15145,16009,@united yesterday did not feel like the best level of service so disappointed
15146,16010,@united I just wanted to let mgmt know there are a number of customers who want PS service between NYC-SEA. Need a lie flat bed like Delta
15154,16018,NY here I come! Waiting to board @JetBlue! All I can think about is the delicious food waiting for me!! #vacation
15160,16024,@AmericanAir The fact that my plane to Chicago had to wait on Chicago Airport  30 mins for them to give the okay to take off.
15171,16035,Does anybody know if you can take a mechanical mod in a #carryon ??? #jetblue @JetBlue We are not trying to #vape on the plane. #safetyfirst
15177,16041,Apparently @AmericanAir hates families with babies. No more pre-boarding...
15190,16056,Everyone that sells a service or product (hence. everyone) must be aware that bad experiences resonate. @United http://t.co/KJGgmoXhWo
15199,16065,Passengers cheering the cleaning crew as they leave the plane. I hope @AlaskaAir gives them hazard pay.
15204,16070,@JetBlue the big event is here! #SonicBoom2014 but sadly I see the flight is delayed. Darn weather

15217,16085,.@united won't fly a plane with a lightbulb out in the lav. but will fly a plane with broken AC. And a 30-minute tarmac wait in the sun.
15226,16094,@united never ceases to amaze me! 2 hr delay in Liberia. Costa Rica. We will miss #LSUfootball today. #timemanagement

15258,16128,.@SouthwestAir also like how you refuse to acknowledge any of my complaints

15315,16186,LGB please don't disappoint me! Please have my laptop in lost n found. @JetBlue
15317,16188,@JetBlue why do we have to board so early? Sitting here for 20 mins is annoying.  Happens every time
15325,16196,@DeltaAssist I just claimed my bonus 15.000 MQMs online...but don't see it in my account.  Is there a delay?
15327,16198,My LAX to JFK flight is flying around weather. Taking a Southern route over Atlanta. Georgia and up the East Coast.  Sigh. @VirginAmerica
15330,16201,Hope @united Will wait for passengers who are desperately trying to catch the shuttle over to terminal C. United flight 3929 came in late.
15332,16203,"@SouthwestAir had to tow us to terminal. Dude watching Bama game didn't understand. asked if we weren't there? I said ""wrong city"" hes upset"
15333,16204,@JetBlue Safety issue. On today's flight B6 1615. seat 14A wouldn't stay upright during takeoff. MacGyver'd a fix with empty water bottle.
15334,16205,A bit disappointed with @AmericanAir's Admiral Lounge at #LAX today. Totally uninterested/inattentive service from wait staff.
15337,16208,@DeltaAssist I never got my platinum sky miles card. How can I request new ones?
15343,16214,Shoutout to @SouthwestAir for letting me watch the  Alabama (1) vs Ole Miss (11) game!  #HottyToddy http://t.co/T6rtqifSpt
15349,16221,Unbelievable! Booked @JetBlue flight home from vaction so I could watch dodgers game. And the game is on mlb network! Unreal #nothappy
15350,16222,@jetblue why can I never check in for my flights on your app?
15358,16230,@united never got airborne. you had mechanical prob in air on 1st trip and turned us around. 3rd flight Took standby to KC. drove to Omaha
15382,16254,Let's talk about everything @AmericanAir did to screw up my day
15388,16260,@AmericanAir I sure do keep on checking still nothing for the 5. 6. 12. or13 not even from Chicago to honk Kong to Mel #ridiculous
15390,16262,JFK gate agent totally gave me attitude when I tried to pre-board cause I travel w/ service animal. not cool @jetblue not cool. #ADA
15397,16270,@united checked bag didn't get from C gates to F tonight. Connecting SEA to SCE through ORD. hope to have it tomorrow. I leave again fri.
15415,16288,@AmericanAir. terrible experience flying from Helsinki. Upgraded and miles deducted without permission. case number: AA Ref#1-2191344979
15417,16290,@AmericanAir on a flight from Manchester (UK) to Las Vegas via Chicago is it permissible to leave the airport as there is an 8 hour layover
15421,16294,@DeltaAssist we r waiting for FA fl 1091 to atl where r they 151 are waiting ???
15428,16301,@united and my daughter has a extra legroom aisle seat! Lol! So should I book late?
15430,16303,.@AmericanAir boeing 767 N390AA departs Manchester kicking up some spray off the wet runway. http://t.co/7nuEMjATxX
15440,16313,So @SouthwestAir is down... Looks like we're stuck in MCO until the computers are back #insane #unhappycustomer #wannagohome
15455,16328,@united Completely dropped the ball by no longer having blankets and pillows on your flights #unhappyflyer
15459,16332,@AmericanAir  once again AA gives a reason that to switch carriers. 260k short lifetime status. Still thinking about switching.
15468,16342,To the woman who stuffed an apple core in the seat pocket on @DeltaAssist fly 874 you are disgusting
15491,16366,@united My flight tmrrw 873 gum to nrt was cancelled. Theres any possibility to have a flight again or status isnt gonna be changed anymore?
15507,16382,@united I'm curious why we all board then have a delay put on us. Not mad. just curious
15520,16395,@southwestair y'all REALLY need an express bag drop line inside #EWR. Used skycap but line's insane #travelwoes https://t.co/orZyelGDaH
15524,16399,Competitors take note: @JetBlue gave a $25 credit for the delay the other day. Thats how you build loyalty.
15539,16414,@AlaskaAir Great job getting a different aircraft for flight 38 this am from SEA to Ft Lauderdale and getting us out with minimal delay!
15545,16420,@JetBlue hey my sister is having a hard time checking in thru the app in iPhone...is there an issue today? Tx
15547,16423,Not gonna lie. this @SouthwestAir plane is comfy. Leather seats. what?! And I__m loving the heart! http://t.co/7EEk6zKA23
15564,16440,Diverted and stuck on plane in Portland. Only First class gets mimosas. #NotFair @AlaskaAir
15566,16442,I hate you @SouthwestAir
15568,16444,@united why is it that you consistently delay. cancel and lose my baggage more than any other airline? Change you name to ONE-SIDED.
15580,16459,Whats up @SouthwestAir how come the early bird fee only got me to B11. What a waste of $25. #ripoff
15587,16466,Flying on @VirginAmerica for the first time ever today - mad fancy. but I can't recline my seat!
15588,16467,Missed out on booking $80 flights.  Hoping for a flash sale to pop up so I can fly to NorCal this weekend...  Don't fail me. @SouthwestAir!
15594,16473,@VirginAmerica Aren__t you killing Nerdbird soon?
15600,16479,@SouthwestAir where are you? We want to go home! Been waiting and waiting... http://t.co/emncym6Hsi
15607,16486,"Not exactly sure what the issue is with our plane and ""not exactly sure how long to fix it"" is not exactly comforting @AmericanAir"

15614,16493,@AmericanAir miss our bag nr BA 416234 a straller. Have been missing 1 week now.
15622,16502,@united United broke my taylor guitar
15624,16504,I really love @JetBlue. but I really hope they don't enforce the fight change for my honeymoon. Not fair to switch me from 4:37pm to 10:47am
15625,16505,@DeltaAssist flight 3697. Do you do this to me on purpose or do you habitually screw everyone over?
15629,16509,@deltaassist worried were going to miss our connection. We land in msp 9 minutes after our flight boards. We're in the last row of the plane
15632,16512,Hey @DeltaAssist - you never ad Sky Miles to my flights. I have the trips in the app. but it never associates it with the flight...
15646,16528,@united still waiting confirmation of what day and time 839 will arrive in MEL. Can you assist with arrival details?
15647,16529,@SouthwestAir your pilots took 30 minutes to calculate some bs before we took off and made us late to our next flight #heated
15654,16536,"@JetBlue iPhone app is on the fritz. It signed me out and won't let me sign back in- ""Request timed out"". and the waiting wheel just spins."

15660,16542,Flight attendant just handed me a life vest to put under my seat. Do they kick ppl off flights? How does ONE life vest go missing @JetBlue?

15671,16553,"@AmericanAir I'm 6'7"" and cannot fit in your standard coach seat. let alone get the tray table to lie horizontally. http://t.co/MDExHDp7jA"
15677,16559,@AlaskaAir ur gold members don't like showing up on time to find you've fully loaded the plane #14 #fail #CustomerExperience
15683,16565,Oh no! My flight on @united airlines from Chicago to Syracuse has been delayed for the second time! I wanna be back home tonight!
15688,16570,OMG! Heart attack! Thought I'd missed checking in on @SouthwestAir but 20 minutes to spare-whew!
15694,16576,@DeltaAssist give the FAs a map of Term A at DTW? Seem to have gotten lost getting from one end to the other.
15696,16578,Airlines are way overdue for an Uber-style disruption. @AmericanAir canceled my connection. stranded me. and lost my bag. #InnovateOrDie
15700,16582,as always @AlaskaAir messing up my itinerary. worst airline...
15706,16588,Going to miss my @americanair connection because of broken printer? This blows.
15710,16593,@united I'm on one of your express aircrafts. I had to wait on a late pilot. You will do something about this. What is it you are going todo
15718,16601,@JetBlue on flight 1089 seat 12A. Fix my TV before the football game starts. It's not working :( this is a bummer.
15721,16605,@AmericanAir Travel is stressful enough. but when your airplane has maintenance issues and causes you to miss connecting flights you should
15729,16613,@AmericanAir Trying to book a ticket to LAX and use my 500 mile upgrades (23 left) but no longer have status. How can I use them?
15736,16621,Good flight home to DCA on @AlaskaAir - great crew and no issues. Glad to see our previous flight w/issues was a misnomer
15737,16622,@DeltaAssist here is hoping delta is on the ball. Short connection due to delta problem
15739,16624,Seems like my usual tiny plane has been replaced by a brand new 737. Not bad @AlaskaAir #homewardbound #Seattle
15741,16626,@VirginAmerica First time with Virgin and disappointed - JFK to LAX flight was late by 2 hours - landed in LAX at 1:30 AM
15742,16628,Officially weirded out by the @SouthwestAir commercial with the up close face smiles.They looked like those annoying self-joke laughing ppl.
15748,16634,@JetBlue If I book a flight with points and have to cancel what's the fee? Points go back to my account?
15749,16635,Starting my last qualifying flight before 1K status on @united. Never thought I'd make 100000 miles by mid October.
15750,16636,I'm trying to check in for my flight from lax to bos tomorrow. but the app isn't working. Is it just my phone. or is this an issue @JetBlue?
15753,16639,Just got home and went to unpack and saw @JetBlue destroyed the bottom of my luggage!  Real nice! #travelfail http://t.co/Jar642W5G5
15758,16644,@DeltaAssist #thankyou lost report filed
15763,16649,@united garbage excuse for economy plus. especially on an international flight http://t.co/rwUoTMzfzU
15766,16652,I miss the days when @VirginAmerica had their getaway deals &amp; no bag charge :( They were always my favorite to fly. Love that #moodlighting
15768,16654,Back home in NYC means weird late night dinners again. Like tonight's Tradee Joe's tofu pad thai sprinkled w/leftover @SouthwestAir peanuts.
15774,16660,@SouthwestAir disappointed in the latest commercial. Southwest depicts only male pilots.
15775,16661,@VirginAmerica your TSA-Precheck integration needs work. 4th flight in a row that it's broken. You're the only airline I have this problem
15781,16667,So @SouthwestAir doesn't fly Embraer jets at all? What a waste of fuel. #NeverFlying #WasteOfFuel #EnvironmentalIssues #Economy
15784,16670,@united what's with the delay of flt#3428 from o'hare to roa? Any updates as to when they will arrive in Va?
15795,16681,@AmericanAir it's not likely to leave at 9:55. is it?  :(

15834,16721,Dear @JetBlue. I love the new MINT program but what's the point if my control panel for my seat is broken and I can't even use the flat bed.
15838,16725,Slightly disappointed @alaskaair the pilots have said literally 0 words to us. #AS524
15865,16755,@united can you advise me of an email address where I can send my letter of complaint?
15869,16759,@united purchased in-flight television and audio did not seem to be included. Headphones were not broken.

16121,17061,Lol and now they switch gates with announcing it. You can't fool ME @AmericanAir!
16124,17064,@AmericanAir could you tell me why American 2216 and 1465 are delayed? doesn't seem to be weather in Dallas.
16125,17065,@DeltaAssist how do I cancel a medallion seat upgrade?
16135,17076,@AmericanAir might just steal me as a customer - this fresh-baked cookie smell is 
16138,17079,Wait a second! When did @SouthwestAir enter 2015 with mobile tickets?! Say it isn't so?! #isthisajoke
16145,17086,@JetBlue in T5. playing the RockBot but U can't hear the music?!? They got the volume on negative 1 today lol? Turn up the music #goodtunes
16150,17091,@JetBlue the buy points area is broken on your website. How much is each 1K points?
16153,17095,@DeltaAssist Hi. I__ve a problem about check in. in your website &amp; app . i tried to check in but i can__t t and i__ve the confirmation !
16156,17098,@AmericanAir Anyway to switch a flight from US Airways to an earlier American flight? Did it this morning and this airport won't do it
16158,17100,@JetBlue saving my points for Mint. Can't wait!
16159,17101,@JetBlue are you JFK-MCO flights often delayed? Need to make sure before I book!
16160,17102,@VirginAmerica Thanks Patricia for going out of your way to assist me with a snow globe issue at Dulles Airport!
16174,17116,@AmericanAir hi u replaced a damaged suitcase for me when I flew to new york but the case u replaced it wiv is faulty now wheel gone funny.
16182,17124,@United last night's long delay of 1723 out of SFO kinda ruined  #UADelightFriendly for us. We landed starving. tired &amp; miserable.
16183,17125,@united .. Missed my connection to Singapore. They took me through expedited immigration at Narita and took care of everything
16184,17126,I think from all the tweets about @united. I can deduce that United is a garbage airline. Hope I never have to step foot on their planes.
16191,17133, super sad that I didn't get hired today by @AlaskaAir  I would have rocked that job
16194,17136,@SouthwestAir what is going on in Vegas been waiting for a gate for 30 minutes?
16201,17143,@AlaskaAir Yes. Got a text message earlier. and I believe app showed delay too; app says it's on time now.
16209,17152,Also there are maybe 12 babies on this plane all crying their eyes out. They are learning young to hate @united as much as I do now.
16216,17159,I'm sure you'll all be thrilled to know... @SouthwestAir has found my bag...2 months later....in the lost bag warehouse  #mixedemotions
16219,17162,@AmericanAir I can't open my claim because I didn't take my damaged clothing and dry cleaning bill to the AirPort with me
16221,17164,I could have walked to Arkansas quicker than waiting for an @AmericanAir flight to arrive on time. #WatchThemTweetAnotherFakeApology
16224,17167,@VirginAmerica I'm going to miss my favorite VA Terminal! http://t.co/SssyLaZwRt
16256,17200,@VirginAmerica ending flights to PHL!!!! I am heartbroken!!!! Ughhhh this stinks... #frequentflyerproblems
16259,17203,@VirginAmerica if not watching MNF is the worst thing that happened on my flight I think we are ok! You guys are great!
16265,17209,Do any United flights take off on time? And not have screaming babies on them? @SouthwestAir can you start flying to Europe?
16266,17210,Bummer I missed the Dallas Love promo BUT you can Join the @VirginAmerica's Elevate program+earn pts #ShareTheLove http://t.co/y90pPJSUpL
16272,17218,90 minutes after scheduled takeoff still on the ground - just a mess with @united on twoflights today http://t.co/vt3ga7cRTZ
16274,17220,@united Pitiful baggage claim at IAH. So far 40 min wait on flight from Dulles.
16276,17222,@SouthwestAir Wifi is extremely slow on board. Long wait time for web pages to load and can't run any apps.
16279,17225,@AmericanAir oh don't worry. when she lands in Dallas and realizes she has to cancel yet another patient's surgery. she'll let you know.
16283,17229,Not only did @united change the times of my flights.  but my EWR to LAX flight is somehow now 30 mins longer...
16284,17230,@DeltaAssist  If only Delta personnel would have brains... People with connecting flights all the way to the end of the plane and plane late
16285,17231,don't bother getting a direct flight with @united - like usually cancelations and now a non-direct flight - worst airline in the USA
16290,17236,Feel like I keep getting lied to by @united. Perhaps this credit card isn't the best option? #fail
16294,17240,Apparently @VirginAmerica has no mobile app and the only mobile boarding pass is Apple Passbook. Bullshit. but hooray #WindowsPhone Wallet!
16296,17242,I ain't even mad @AmericanAir. Do ya thang lol.
16299,17245,.@JetBlue gave me an email address so I could check back. The actual folks who have my lost wallet cannot be bothered to pick up my calls.
16309,17255,@united I have a problem.
16322,17268,Thank you @VirginAmerica for letting me watch the Skins game on my flight!  Missing the hometown already 
16327,17273,@VirginAmerica I'm waiting your follow back :(
16329,17275,3+ hours late on my @united flight from Chicago to Salt Lake City. It's going to be a very late night. #notveryfun
16333,17279,@JetBlue not one to complain and I fly a lot.. But direct tv down &amp; no wifi to blog on from both SLC-LGB and LGB-SFO is not looking great _
16334,17280,@JetBlue my tv worked fine. but the other 2 in my row did not. Address the overall problem not the individual issue
16335,17281,@united can I please cancel my outbound flight (blue)? I can easily take a bus from Dallas to Shreveport. http://t.co/DLI2DDs0a2
16337,17283,@VirginAmerica I felt wicked safe on my last trip! Ready for your next flight! Keep me safe! I'm young and I have lots of breeding potential
16338,17284,@AlaskaAir so...I guess y'all never found my phone huh...?
16345,17293,@united sorry! You have lost 2 very frequent flyers!! The service we have had every time we fly with u has been #appalling bad #airline
16348,17296,@AmericanAir So many reps. so little honesty. Our whole group is missing bags and you tell us all conflicting info. We're over. Don't call.
16353,17302,@deltaassist Cologne stolen from sealed toiletry bag inside my checked roll aboard during RDU &gt; MSP itinerary today. Contact me tomorrow.
16354,17303,@AlaskaAir can you ship us some of the extra ice on your igloo home floors the one direction fandom lost it's chill again
16366,17316,It seems like every flight from CVG to ORD there's an issue. This AM. the plane smells like we are inside a portapotty! @DeltaAssist #Delta
16370,17320,@DeltaAssist I should cancel my travel plan. how do I get a credit for my reservation?
16377,17328,@DeltaAssist is the latest iPhone app broken? I am not logged on anymore and I cannot log back in. Trying to view flight options
16379,17330,On the phone with @united Airlines. Vegetarian meals from Shanghai to SFO are no longer possible?  Or you just don't want to bother?  :-(
16384,17335,Disappointed @JetBlue no longer gives you a credit when your fare drops (unless you pay $75) Must have missed the memo about that policy. 
16387,17338,@DeltaAssist I'm having problem with the Fly Delta app
16392,17343,@JetBlue First time on JetBlue and I get this message? NOT a good first impression. http://t.co/rJrop7qwZY
16393,17344,@united understood. but most of these are your fault. U always acknowledge the problem but never do anything about it or even apologize!
16394,17345,@DeltaAssist Mobile app is having issues today.
16395,17346,Flying @SouthwestAir tomorrow for the first time. Hopefully no issues.
16396,17347,Hi @DeltaAssist. any idea why your iPhone app has kicked me out and wont let me authenticate? SORT OF inconvenient.
16397,17348,@DeltaAssist is there a problem with the delta app?
16398,17349,Flying irritation: if i understand their policy correctly. @united will automatically cancel a return trip if you miss the outbound flight.
16400,17351,@DeltaAssist lots of problems with http://t.co/qsOPaACKUc this morning
16403,17354,Being a #trueblue member for years it's obvious that @JetBlue won't be bothered with quality customer service I guess that just #doesntfly
16405,17356,@DeltaAssist Android Delta app has a problem connecting this AM Multiple medallions w this prob.
16416,17368,New Orleans is waiting for YOU! Free Money &amp; trips to New Orleans with @AlaskaAir at 7am. 11am &amp; 4pm #LiveOnSTAR
16419,17371,@JetBlue Hi. I booked my flight Sunday. now today there is the 20% off promotion.  Am I stuck with the higher fare?
16422,17374,@DeltaAssist - mobile app is not working correctly. If I had not gotten here early. I would have likely missed my flight as a result.
16427,17380,@JetBlue what a ripoff. My one way fare went from $230 to $94 and Jet blue will not change it w/o a $170 fee. Fly Southwest!
16437,17391,@AlaskaAir your check in process at SFO is soooooo slow! (And by process I mean people)
16439,17393,Flying across the US with @JetBlue in April. Never flown them before but I've only heard great things. &amp; wifi on board! #ttot #SanFran #NYC
16440,17394,Yesterday's flight cxlled.  This mornings flight left late due to faulty breaker.  Crew listed it as air traffic control. @united
16443,17397,Ok. I got duped on travel insurance. and that was my fault. But for @AmericanAir to quote me 2 prices to reinstate miles...c'mon
16447,17403,@DeltaAssist - I am unable to log in on my Delta app. I can log in on the PC however. are there problems with the Delta app?
16451,17408,@DeltaAssist my husband's bag has been missing for 2 wks. still nothing. no claims manager NOTHING. Let's be real - this is robbery!!
16454,17411,@DeltaAssist Unfortunately we missed our flight - they didn't wait for us. And then we had to fly into an entirely different city :/
16455,17412,@united ur a joke. just deplaned after a delay bc of a mechanical issue not fixed yesterday. Say what? #southwestisbest
16458,17415,@southwestair originally tried chrome and firefox_same problem.  just tried today in chrome for you. http://t.co/um1yG9trc0
16472,17429,@JetBlue I need a direct number to call. because I get disconnected when your wait time runs out my phone credit and then I'm put on hold.
16474,17431,ANALYSIS: Can a new CEO fix @JetBlue's problems? (Subscribers only) http://t.co/LONdFMZOCO
16479,17436,@AmericanAir so unnecessarily stressful :(
16483,17441,@united I was following up more so on how you plan to compensate a United frequent flier for the inconvenience
16492,17450,I like that @JetBlue has free wifi on some of their planes for web surfing. Too bad it is still rather buggy. I cant load most sites.
16494,17452,Stuck in Baltimore because of @SouthwestAir 's supreme incompetence. #thankyou
16503,17461,"Oh my.. the CSR with @DeltaAssist   just said ""blah blah blah""  You're killing me. No confirmation email either. #deltawebsite hahaha"
16515,17475,Stuck on a plane on the tarmac at LAX. I'll give you one guess as to which airline it is. @AmericanAir.
16519,17479,@VirginAmerica getting $50 credit for future flight due to delay without even asking was nice. the weird travel bank thing. ugh_
16523,17483,@AmericanAir Got my bag. yes. Trip disruption wasn't the problem. how it was handled by AA was. Your crew left us stranded without info!
16530,17490,NOOO I got a seat with a broken TV how am I supposed to order the best lunch on the menu before it's sold out/watch Bravo. @VirginAmerica?!
16539,17499,There has to be a rule about doing your nails on the plane. Acrylic fumes are unpleasant @AlaskaAir
16543,17503,Maybe the @united pilot is having a hard time finding reverse on this bad boy. #stillatgate #anhourlate
16545,17505,@JetBlue CAN I CANCEL EVEN MORE SPEED AFTER PURCHASE?
16549,17509,@DeltaAssist Please add follow so I can dm about an issue.
16586,17547,Killing me @JetBlue for canceling your AUS-SFO direct flight. It's my route 3-4 times a yr :( http://t.co/GMnL1hePJD
16621,17587,@AmericanAir do not fly till African flights banned. Govt lies
16628,17594,.@AmericanAir I hate everyone ahead of me in the upgrade list. What do i do?
16640,17606,Flight got delayed. of course @AlaskaAir always on top of things
16649,17616,@AlaskaAir has done literally everything wrong today and has lost me for good
16667,17634,Twitter accounts like @united are jokes. They ask you to DM info so you stop tweeting about them and then they go silent. Don't waste time.
16677,17644,@DeltaAssist hi. I've been sent 5-6 emails about airline tickets I've never even purchased  ...
16683,17650,@JetBlue I just switched flights and will spend from roughly 9pm -7am in the airport with no hotel.  Cause its airtraffic based.
16684,17651,Been flying with @SouthwestAir for forever and I have yet to experience any inconvenience. _ They are my topic for my Marketing Audit!
16689,17656,@AlaskaAir Kudos to the ladies at check-in PHX oct 6.  We missed our check-in but they helped us get on the next flight to SEA.
16694,17661,I hate flying. but I've got a pup next to me so all is well in the flight world. God speed @JetBlue pilot
16695,17662,@JetBlue is everything ok with flight 690? my mom said there was a problem with the landing gear now fire trucks are on the tarmac
16701,17668,Off to NYC. Will miss you Puerto Rico!! Let's see if I can get a free drink with my Trueblue credit card ;) @jetblue
16702,17669,@AmericanAir really ? Still haven't moved! Thought these were supposed to be new planes? Yet mechanical probs so soon?
16714,17682,3 wks of hectic intl travel off to bad start @DeltaAssist. Platinum upgrade ATL-LAX but never added to list so lower status rec'd mine.
16721,17689,Not sure I understand having to tag your own bags @AlaskaAir ? Isn't there already enough to stress when traveling? Won't more bags be lost?
16724,17692,My jinx on @United continues. Out of the 250K miles I flew during last 12 months. the two flts on this airline resulted in damaged bags. 1/2
16729,17697,Really hoping I don't miss my connecting flight!!! #AmericanAirlines @AmericanAir Hold flight 4266 for me! Going to Indy!
16734,17703,Instead of handing out excuses. @SouthwestAir employees handed out travel vouchers to anyone who'd sing a song over the PA. #iluvswa
16735,17704,@JetBlue Upon booking a flight. is there a period of time in which one can cancel or change the flight without incurring a fee?  Thanks
16737,17706,Damn @JetBlue --15 planes ahead of us on the runway #notcool #nopatience
16739,17708,Okay tweeters it time for the bad customer service to stop. Tweet your @SouthwestAir stories with #SWASUX

16744,17713,I bought @SouthwestAir WiFi for flights today. Didn't work for most of SFO-LAX. then my long flight was on a plane from 1970. What a waste.
16750,17719,@AlaskaAir I know we can't bat 100. but a promise is a promise. Still waiting on my bag. #75K
16752,17721,while I am extremely thankful @SouthwestAir held the plane to wait for me so I can get home tonight. that connection was hella stressful
16758,17727,@DeltaAssist 9:30 pm I received reply to my email to delta (9:30 am) apologizing. sounding like they have never heard of today's issues. sad
16759,17728,Thought I was going to miss my @SouthwestAir connecting flight but they waited for us!!!!! _ #sohappy #wpbbound #yesiranthroughtheairport

16781,17753,Hey @JetBlue. what's up with your #BoneheadPilot? Kicked everyone off plane by making up accusation that someone thought he was drunk.
16783,17755,@SouthwestAir what happened to nonstop service between Salt Lake City in Portland? Is it gone or am I missing something. Morris no more
16785,17757,@JetBlue Flight 760 has big issue in Philly tonight - pilot makes false accusations about passengers and orders all back to gate
16787,17759,@united a bunch of us Humans are waiting at C28 at ORD for the flight crew. Tell them we're tired and want to go home
16790,17762,Flew to LA this past weekend from PDX on @AlaskaAir .  Please consider flying to JAX from PDX. Then I'd never have to fly any other airline!
16794,17766,Oh @SouthwestAir- it's been quite the journey this week. TU 4 changing my flights quickly due to the Midway issue. Sharon in #vegas rocks!!
16797,17769,Can't wait to buy my tix to California tomorrow!!!  especially since I'm riding @VirginAmerica! Been hearing nothing but great things!
16800,17773,Shocking service from @united IAD to Toronto tonight. shambolic and amateurish.I feel for all those who missed their connections as a result
16804,17777,@DeltaAssist Ok. Drip delays are really annoying though. Wish you guys would just cancel if you're going to. or give a real delay otherwise.
16805,17778,@DeltaAssist what's going on with flight 4802 lots of upset ppl at LAX
16814,17788,@JetBlue disappointed you wouldn't tell a connecting flight to wait 10min knowing that an arriving flight was delayed.  #stuckforthrnight

17899,18945,@united pilots left the plane and we are lost here in Chicago ua972
17903,18949,@united this is a lie. Why lie to pissed off customers? http://t.co/yC6wcqIzOE
17904,18950,.@SouthwestAir  You see? This is what happens when you don't let someone on a flight after they SCREAM TO YOU ABOUT THEIR DYING GRANDFATHER.
17907,18954,.@united would luv to make my next flight since it's the last 1 today. Flying into O'Hare has to be frustrating for everybody!
17911,18958,@JetBlue You definitely need to get ABC as a channel option!! Gonna miss my Thursday shows. :'(
17934,18981,Oh @JetBlue ... this is bad. Very bad http://t.co/rh9npJrbrA
17935,18982,Just encountered the bitchest snob at  @AlaskaAir at the seattle airport. Worst employee.
17936,18983,Ok... This plane is an REALLY late taking off.  Let's go. Austin is waiting!! Come on @SouthwestAir
17944,18991,@DeltaAssist do you have a lost and found item number?

17954,19001,The correlation between me being on board @AmericanAir and them departing late is strong. Now. it's time to refuel with zero miles flown.
17983,19033,@JetBlue REALLY? come on in this day and age you should know better. just fess up to your stupidity. #Jetblue #Sucks #BS
17984,19034,@AmericanAir there is no excuse for this experience to be this bad. You guys need to assess the logic in some of your practices.
17993,19043,Getting on a @SouthwestAir flight is so stressful. who knows what my seating situation will look like over here from boarding group C
18002,19052,.@JetBlue passenger kicked off flight for tweeting about delays: http://t.co/1CmYiJ1bCY
18004,19054,@united come on... You say plane is late pilot tells us the plane has issues. Got no air conditioning... #justtellus
18007,19057,would have stuck with @AmericanAir (lot of directs b/w LA and NYC/BOS). but their new planes A321T makes flying in couch UNBEARABLE
18009,19059,@DeltaAssist this never happens on US air!!
18013,19063,"Really annoyed @VirginAmerica Didn't bring out my drink or chips after ordered. back seat pocket broke. ""oh that's broken"". yeah I know "
18020,19071,@SouthwestAir #maggieneedsherluggage THIS IS PROBLEM

18078,19130,@JetBlue you guys are full of shit! I would NEVER use your services again!!
18079,19131,@JetBlue I read the article. You folks need training in conflict resolution. Sure you get ticked at angry passengers. but you made them.
18091,19143,@JetBlue So if we complain about a late flight we will get kicked off the flight? http://t.co/nlGtSg2mqu

18335,19406,And on the way back. discovered that @JetBlue is terribly overrated: surly flight attendants. bad check in. and poor BoB.
18339,19410,I retract my earlier tweet. Having to fly @united is the worst.

18886,19996,Bummed. The captive portal is broken on @JetBlue #flyfi so I can't get online. http://t.co/DgEbbVwJIK
18887,19997,@AmericanAir can you tell Flight 1146 to wait.  I'm pulling up to gate C10 now and just need 10 min to make it to D17
18891,20001,Eat shit. @AmericanAir.
18897,20007,New one for @AmericanAir. Folks missing connections and bags because cargo door won't open in Dallas. #FreeMyBag
18901,20011,@united I am very upset you didn't respect my already checked-in and confirmed seat and sent me to the very end of the oversold plane
18904,20015,Tweeting during the art of flight. and enough leg room to stretch for miles @JetBlue you're killing it #TeamFly-Fi http://t.co/MszGiKg45S
18914,20025,@SouthwestAir waited patiently my adult life for the #WrightAmendment to fly #wrightoutofhere
18919,20030,@JetBlue changed our flight last minute from LGA to jfk...  Mad dash to get there but we made it... Cancun bound. Thank God for #tsaprecheck
18922,20033,I've not left ORD on time in the last 5 years. Today we pushed back on time. but now we're back unloading a bag. Ridiculous. @AmericanAir
18923,20034,"@DeltaAssist: ""Although partners. every airline is a separate entity. *CA_ Yes. Link the systems. Reduce friction. The status quo stinks."
18924,20035,Not a bad way to start the day in #DEN @united http://t.co/sK684DH0Y4
18930,20041,Boarded the early flight to #JFK courtesy of @JetBlue  Thanks for assisting me in getting this shit show started sooner! #HustlaBall2014 #RB

18964,20077,"Props to @SouthwestAir playing ""waiting"" by tom petty while we are sitting delayed on the runway. #jokes"
18967,20081,@SouthwestAir can't wait to take with my lawyer. No pre-flight announcement about allergy. If I have to use my epipen on my child... #Peanut
18969,20083,I don't hate @AlaskaAir. quite nice people. but I hate your MVP passengers. talking about you 3A. 3C...and 11D and 11F too

19040,20160,Looks like the #heart was missing from most of #Southwest today @SouthwestAir
19041,20161,"Applauding @AlaskaAir on an efficient boarding process. even if my row was in the ""&amp;everyone else"" category :) Seat +bin space no problem!"
19043,20164,Yo @AmericanAir you on a roll! Today no water available on the plane. No toilets. no coffee. no tea. Oh but wait you have sanitizing wipes!
19044,20165,@DeltaAssist  Bad experience last night on 4147 from MSP to IND. Was full fare first class bumped to coach
19045,20166,The @SouthwestAir terminal at LAX is a shit show. If I miss my flight cause they're understaffed I'm going to flip.
19046,20167,@DeltaAssist can you please not cancel my whole flight if I skip the first connecting flight. PLEASE. Otherwise I would have to drive 6hrs _
19049,20171,@united That link takes me to a broken page.
19050,20172,Gotta hand it to @united: Was delayed. would have missed connector. my cousins &amp; this weekend's game... Til they booked me on a competitor!
19060,20184,@DeltaAssist Currently delayed out of SFO because of Air Force One and will prob miss connection at DTW to ORD. Any advice?
19072,20197,"Ahh...  It all makes sense now @united ~ ""Ground control issues"" eh? http://t.co/32qzDrxE5j"
19082,20209,@AmericanAir I did. They were very aware of the problem.
19085,20212,@united I'm on flight 1662 stuck at San Jose for 50 mins now. They should be bussing us to SFO and at least handing out water
19089,20216,True story. Landed at #IAD and the Jetway rammed our plane and broke the door. Now we cannot get out. Cc: @united
19116,20244,Waiting @united 757... http://t.co/BvZtcSvqMz
19117,20245,@southwestair there is no weather problem. My son missed meeting Darnell Dockett because of your ineptness. #flightdelay
19121,20249,@united I'm glad you replied. because last night on UA867 my 1yr old was about as bad as a 1yr old can ever be on a plane. The stewards were
19124,20252,@SouthwestAir purchased wifi on iPad. Slower than I remember dial up. Any chance for refund? Had 2 wait 3 ... http://t.co/Q6DH3a2LjF
19129,20257,@united book flights for a friend &amp; myself. have to cancel it &amp; gave him cash. We no longer speak &amp; I'm being told the credit can't be used?
19140,20269,@united This is my fourth time flying you guys and I'm never on time.
19144,20274,Cancelled flight and stuck in Chicago until our rebooked flight tomorrow. Please don't let us down tomorrow. @united .
19152,20282,@DeltaAssist badly
19164,20294,Dear @VirginAmerica if planned construction at SFO will delay flights. perhaps tell us BEFORE we schlep to LAX at 7am Sunday morning.Idiots.
19166,20296,@AmericanAir plz make sure hotels have morning shuttles if you cancel flights n rebook people. Cab $ is coming out of our pocket apparently
19177,20309,@AlaskaAir What will happen to those missing a connecting flight in Seattle due to the 40 minute delay?
19181,20315,New @AmericanAir fails miserably. 7 segments this wk. None one on time. Glad to be Delta Airlines loyalist AmexGold card carrier #thumbsdown
19184,20318,@SouthwestAir lost all 5 of our bags and  they won't know if they find them until tomorrow when we leave on our cruise!!
19195,20330,@united You dont have the back of sea mammals! Stop transporting LIVE sea mammals! Youre killing them! #tweet4taiji http://t.co/36tF3tHodF

19211,20346,I am so disappointed with @united. my sister flew with them today with her two kids and ended up stranded in Chicago overnight with no bags!
19214,20350,@AmericanAir  You really blew it today.  I haven't flow AA for a while now I remember why!  Late flights. missed connections &amp; lost luggage!
19216,20352,@DeltaAssist I was told there was NO changing table on my plane and I would have to wait till we landed or figure it out. But There was one.
19218,20354,@DeltaAssist any tips for a first time flyer? Anything please. flying out tomorrow late afternoon and looking forward to my trip..thanks
19227,20363,@JetBlue  there will B... Can't wait to.go.bck home they where nice and FRIENDLY
19230,20366,@DeltaAssist is there a complaint email address?
19231,20367,@JetBlue Oh. cool. thanks! What are you doing up so late?
19243,20379,@united: Apologies for the inconvenience. We're sure our team is doing all possible to resolve &amp; will have you on your way ASAP - I doubt it
19246,20382,@united this is the problem with automated messages :D see full conversation. please ;)
19248,20384,@AmericanAir for starters. make sure your pilot shows up on time. I know when I'm late to work. I inconvenience people.
19250,20386,Makes Ohio weather look awful #jhusocial RT @JetBlue: http://t.co/Ffb1eLqNjc
19252,20388,@AmericanAir The elevators on the model are supposed to be switched to the other side
19257,20394,@DeltaAssist trying to book a gf meal but its telling me not allowed on this flight. Why? Had no issue when flying out.
19258,20395,Flight #0133 BOS - SFO with no TV service. It's gonna be a long one @JetBlue #goingdark #nowwhat http://t.co/HCxDfof1ev
19260,20397,@SouthwestAir it's more than inconvenience it's indifference. You aren't UA or Delta
19262,20399,@SouthwestAir your security situation in STL is an abomination. Never again.
19263,20400,I am so unbelievably mad at @SouthwestAir.
19265,20402,Stuck on a runway in Houston on a @united flight trying to make connection along with many others. Surprisingly no open gates to park at???
19266,20403,"Waiting for @united part to be ""flown in"" - why can't they give us a time estimate?"
19276,20414,@SouthwestAir You stole our flight from Raleigh-Phx. I will miss part of my confrence. No other alternative avalible!!!!?
19286,20427,@DeltaAssist rebooked on MUCH later flight. Not accommodating and NOT ok. Stuck in ATL
19288,20429,Hoping our @VirginAmerica flight from DAL to LAX in the morning doesn't get delayed due to the bad weather moving into Dallas overnight. _
19291,20434,@united  oh yes I have a list of names. I Will be writing a complaint letter.
19294,20437,@SouthwestAir it's sad. SW used to treat all their customers like A Listers. it's the reason I always fly SW. Next you'll charge for bags 
19298,20441,@DeltaAssist is it a problem if the my middle initial is combined with my first name on my ticket. Joshuac Scott is how it's listed.
19302,20445,"Hi @AmericanAir. Had a bad exp with one of your ""distressed passenger"" hotels. How can I report to AA folks that choose your hotel partners?"
19308,20451,@SouthwestAir lost my bag yesterday...but had it to my front door by the time I was done with my nap. Southwest is where its at.
19310,20453,@SouthwestAir when I saw your seaworld plane it broke my heart #Blackfish
19321,20465,@AmericanAir we're not involved but understand :) It wouldn't have been your fault ;) #YouGuys
19322,20466,@united why is it everyone time someone I know or myself uses your service. your planes always have mechanical problem?! It's annoying!
19334,20478,@SouthwestAir How long before our scheduled trip do we have before we decide to cancel and get airfare credit?
19349,20493,Oh man! @AlaskaAir is pulling us back in to check out a mechanical issue. Ugh. #bettersafethanexplodingiguess
19350,20494,@AmericanAir can't believe that I lost a day from my vacation due to flights not making schedule. Perhaps Delta is worth the extra cash. :(
19352,20497,@JetBlue you break my pockets and the linings of my and he bag goes bad.. http://t.co/eedS6DivNf
19356,20501,@united Why do you no longer let people with babies bored before most? #superdifficult #noprebored #hugeline #cryinginfant #impatientpeople
19363,20508,@JetBlue kicked a lady off the plane because of a tweet. its funny how pathetic that pilot is. Ignorant decision on both parties.
19368,20515,Ty @united for making my 2:20 departure leave at 2:15 so I miss my flight. Glad you all cared so much to not wait for a connecting flight
19372,20519,@JetBlue $50 upgrade seat: BROKEN TV??? #notgoodservice #shameonyou #badflight #Airlines
19383,20532,Not loving coach on @AmericanAir Boeing 737 - I think I have never been in a coach seat this small. Ask US air for their layout
19390,20539,@SouthwestAir then I can't watch the 1 game I wanna watch. Sucks. Whatever
19398,20547,@VirginAmerica No problem.  But the TV's been out last couple times -- trouble with Dish or just my bad luck?
19401,20551,@VirginAmerica I love and use Virgin America but I never get any elevate points. Does it go by who flies or who books the flight? :(
19404,20554,Just booked our Honeymoon flights to Lima with @AmericanAir can't wait!
19411,20561,Thought I would give @AmericanAir another chance after a 7 yr boycott. but they managed to disappoint again. 2 of 2 flights today delayed.
19415,20565,Wait what. A @united passenger plane just flew over the park! #FleetWeekSF #bigplanes #presidio #sfsummer
19420,20570,Now in the #EWR @AmericanAir Admirals Club waiting for my flight to #DFW
19432,20584,@DeltaAssist Having a few issues checking in online for my flight tomorrow...my ticket can't be validated?

19441,20594,@DeltaAssist is flt 4048 delayed this Sunday for same reason as last?
19452,20606,@SouthwestAir  Not much value in the drink coupons. no Monster and now no vitamin water. If you don't drink alcohol they are worthless
19459,20613,Still waiting for these hazmat suited up firefighters to board @United 703 so they can deal with sick woman. http://t.co/v9qRmKwVD2
19460,20615,@DeltaAssist I expect better from you Delta! Since no alt flts available. I expect to be compensated for my wasted time.
19465,20620,@JetBlue delayed flight isn't the best way to start a honeymoon haha but at least we're on our way to Disney!
19473,20628,I travel with #jetblue a lot. but this time the customer service was terrible from check in to the end of the flight @JetBlue
19474,20629,That moment when you're waiting for pilots to show up to fly your plane for 25 minutes. @AmericanAir #WhatsGoingOn
19482,20637,@AmericanAir Been on hold for 33 minutes now. What's the average wait time for calls? Just curious
19488,20643,@AmericanAir Erland and Joyce Alto Flying with you. will be stuck in Chicago tonight. 80 years old. They can't sleep in the airport
19490,20645,@AmericanAir Seems like 926 is gonna be late. Any room on the next DFW-LAS after AA2443?
19493,20648,Hi @VirginAmerica! Please don't let Flight VX415 leave without us. They just closed a line to security and we can't get through!!
19500,20655,They use to care Everytime I  fly their late! Scheduled at 7:40 pm and delayed to9:20 Not even a sorry Your losing my loyalty @SouthwestAir

19521,20680,@united what terminal does 695 leave from tomorrow
19523,20682,Not happy with @JetBlue
19525,20685,Also. these @SouthwestAir commercials with the attendants annoy me. Last time I flew with them. I got judged HARD for asking for a drink.
19526,20686,"Don't let these @SouthwestAir commercials fool you! Their whole vibe is ""don't wait in line for the toilet.""That's their whole vibe!"""
19537,20698,@DeltaAssist it's not working but G9W9YO
19538,20699,Delayed by tardy crew. bad turbulence and long tarmac delay on landing. Not their fault. but another @AmericanAir tough flight tonight
19541,20703,@SouthwestAir bad taste in commercial do you only have white employees?
19549,20711,Hey @JetBlue thanks for the broken TV credit. but can you explain how/why you sent an email with my account password IN CLEARTEXT!?!
19561,20724,@JetBlue I'm on flight 302 (FLL-JFK). and the TV system is broken. Chose this flight to watch the NFL game tonight - not a happy camper
19569,20733,@united Onflight smiles went fm bad to worse after the merge.It seems like management acknowledged it n some improvement can def be seen now
19573,20737,@united the flightcrew frm UA406 said I cld leave my carryon drng layover In Denver. And then the crew removed it. Now its lost in CO. Upset
19583,20748,@DeltaAssist Missing miles from one segment of a six-segment trip. Virgin flight from AKL to SYD on 9/13
19585,20750,It's remarkable how much a plane can smell like urine.... @JetBlue
19593,20758,@VirginAmerica. Please for the love of god. stop with the horrible hip hop safety video. I'm trapped like an animal and can't escape.

19704,20877,Just saw mayor of Dallas posing for pics with the @SouthwestAir Go Go girls. Isn't he busy with the Ebola issue?
19706,20879,Looking forward to a non-stop flight with @SouthwestAir this morning; never flown This airline before.
19711,20884,@united how long has this lounge thing been going on for? And for how much longer?

19761,20939,I made it finally @VirginAmerica silver status! Never flying another airline again 
19766,20944,The incompetence of @AmericanAir is incredible. My 54 year old mother slept on the floor in the O'Hare last night. #BADCUSTOMERSERVICE

19856,21041,Horrible service on @VirginAmerica  yesterday. Fly VA all the time.  Yesterday. they jumped the shark.  Reconsidering my allegiance.
19859,21044,man. i guess @VirginAmerica picked a bad time to launch service to Dallas...

19902,21090,@united :thanks.. stuck on 4357 diverted to LA ftom IAH....let us off. ...
19903,21091,@SouthwestAir OK southwest why the long delay in abq going home to seattle. Supposed to leave at 1:55 now it is 5:20
19915,21104,My flight kept gettin delayed. I had to miss work &amp; school today because of it and was stuck there overnight @AmericanAir
19945,21136,@AmericanAir Can you tell me if I have a backup reservation on a flight for tomorrow morning if I miss my connection in DFW today?
19950,21141,"Glad @SouthwestAir can break something during my friends recent trip and tell her ""too bad. so sad"".  Classy airline."
19960,21154,@JetBlue Thank you so much for making my experience as a person w/health issues so pleasant!
19974,21168,Free cupcakes waiting for us in the terminal at Dallas Love Field? I love @VirginAmerica! I'll never fly another airline again.
19979,21173,@united flights were delayed both routes on this trip. __
19986,21181,@AmericanAir 2293 just turned back due to a pressurization issue. I need to get to DFW tonight. Can you rebook me in 1st?
19989,21184,@SouthwestAir #NONSTOPLOVE . Southwest has new policy they don't disclose taking your money on plane tickets. lost $400.   #NOLOVE
19993,21188,Can you count the clouds?  Making the best of a flight delay @united #QuiteBeautiful http://t.co/CtcNUb7OYA
19995,21190,@JetBlue ugh but thank u for answering quickly

20005,21202,Literally praying to the aviation gods that my @AmericanAir flights gets me to STL tonight! Don't really wanna miss work tomorrow...
20009,21206,@AmericanAir 1h in the plane to unboard &amp; board 2nd. to unboard again aft 40m. 1st a fire ext. perm than the tires. Not bad luck. Bad admin!
20014,21211,@SouthwestAir had to cancel a bus. trip. didn't realize you steal the $25 for early bird?! no credit for the future flight #badbusiness
20019,21217,@JetBlue Will do. Just really want to redeem thepoints. Odd that the first one would go through so quickly and this one is taking longer
20030,21229,@AmericanAir Cancelling flights from Orlando until Wednesday w/ no vouchers. hotel comp or rental car reimbursement? Just atrocious CS
20040,21242,@SouthwestAir we had to cancel our air tickets due to a left at the alter status. We don't want them to have the funds.
20046,21248,@DeltaAssist I forgot something on a plane today in Seattle. What is the phone number for the Seattle delta lost and found?
20053,21256,@AmericanAir 2488. I was suppose to leave at 4:40.
20058,21261,@AmericanAir everyone is onboard and seated but no pilots to be found. Never thought I'd have to wait on them. Turn on the AC please AA354
20061,21264,@VirginAmerica welcome to Big D. can't wait for my trip with you all
20063,21266,@united you guys have some of the most poorly managed logistical systems in transportation history #5StraightDelays
20077,21283,Forget platform 9 3/4. I'm waiting @AmericanAir's Gate D0 at LGA. It's a real shitshow here today.
20078,21284,Got a $25 credit from @JetBlue b/c of the delay yesterday. That is better than free drinks. #gothome
20084,21290,Apparently @AmericanAir would like all the passengers on that plane that emergency landed to call and sort out their own travel!?! Insane.
20088,21295,Landed in Denver. now we are stuck on the plane. @united is keeping us hostage!!
20089,21296,#Panthers Tweets: Check out the @JetBlue Tarmac before the puck drops at 7:30 for some Monday night #streethockey!__ http://t.co/eW0RQPW6jy
20091,21298,@AmericanAir stuck in raleigh! Who drives a truck into a plane? Now I'm stuck paying a taxi out of pocket!!! Wtf
20093,21300,@DeltaAssist donuts don't solve flight problems. neither do sodas. Nor does not telling anyone what the issue is.
20109,21316,@SouthwestAir we have been waiting since 2pm plane supposedly to depart at 3:45pm It's 6:45pm Fort Lauderdale to San Juan.#whatsgoingon

20152,21362,I heart @jetblue!  Even when there's a delay.  Communication is great! Will only fly Blue!
20166,21378,@JetBlue No updates. I can also do without the free snacks. but thanks I guess. Never experienced #traveling like this...
20179,21393,"@AmericanAir Your new slogan:""Do you want to get fracked like you have never been fracked before?We do it the best!"" #HorriblealAtEveryStep"
20182,21396,"Hey. there @southwestair. Excuse me. I mean ""hey ya'll."" Is this really what the airline of LUV represents? http://t.co/iNU8ACsvyu"
20185,21399,@JetBlue another broken headphone jack.  This really wasn't my trip.  How do I end up with broken ones on both legs of my trip?
20192,21406,.@SouthwestAir really killing it with these WiFi speeds again. This is a systemic issue. not just my bad luck http://t.co/JyQaNvQjlt

20201,21415,@JetBlue Why the delay on Fl 1916?
20211,21425,@AmericanAir u took away my miles years ago (poor cs) but #unitedairlines new screw u loyalty program is worse so why should I come back?
20216,21430,@SouthwestAir You can keep killing trees with your mailings. As long as it's $99/yr to have a 16%+ credit card I'll never get it.
20222,21436,As mentioned. I travel with #jetblue a lot. but this time the customer service was terrible from check in to the end of the flight @JetBlue
20227,21441,@united truly embarrassing performance today. 30 feet away from gate on runway w no agents to be found so now I miss my flight 10 gates away
20232,21446,Killing some time. (at @United Club in San Francisco. CA) https://t.co/6dZxOt8j9B
20233,21447,@americanair at it again! AA2330 was to leave MIA for IAD at 8:20 pm. It will now leave around 11:45 pm!!! How is this possible?!
20239,21453,@AmericanAir I guess the delay has been updated to only 19 minutes. I guess thats ok. http://t.co/2mqPuCA2eI
20244,21458,@AlaskaAir I have no complaints. It looks like the issue just happened on the flight in.
20250,21464,@AmericanAir I am over the delayed flights. I have class tomorrow morning _
20257,21472,@united what is the deal w/ flight 4259? I need to get home &amp; the updates I'm receiving aren't very informative. Will I leave IAH tonight?
20268,21483,@AmericanAir. can you guys get real half &amp; half. please? packets of chemical-laden non-dairy creamer is a #fail. http://t.co/9npuvN1Vp2

20288,21505,@united  bags starting to move. Each on separate flights. Ugh maybe today maybe tomorrow  Anybody gonna compensate me for your incompetence
20293,21510,@JetBlue . I flew southwest this time.hate it. Hated being hear like cattle. Small bag nuts. Partial coke. Never again!! Jetblue only
20295,21512,I'm exhausted. I may need to switch back to @AmericanAir permanently for all my Chicago trips. Really needed this. http://t.co/0yW4t5oCj7
20301,21519,"@JetBlue I wouldn't exactly call the hour to half and a half we were just quoted by the capt as ""too much longer."""
20324,21545,Notice there is an increase of @united airlines ads on TV. Poor attempt at damage control after disrespecting a Military Serviceman.
20332,21553,@SouthwestAir when a plan is only 75% full and you are announcing every seat will be taken. you ruin your credibility. #justsaying :)
20352,21575,GREAT IM IN CONNECTICUT WHAT THE FUCK @JetBlue HOWD I END UP HERE
20358,21581,.@SouthwestAir - how many jobs lost because of the expiration of the Wright Amendment??
20359,21582,@jetblue flight 810. Diverted destination landing into a different state; no updates. cant leave the plane. no water- problems both ways!!!
20367,21590,Everyone remind me not to fly @united. OK? Have never not been delayed.

20383,21608,@AlaskaAir It's amazing how quickly your feelings can change from one customer service interaction  Alaska calling me a liar.  Nope.  #proof
20387,21612,Not cool @JetBlue not cool 
20414,21640,With the wait I dealt with today I'm sure @AmericanAir will not be my goto again
20418,21644,I'm so sad I booked my #vegas flight with @VirginAmerica and didn't use the promo code LOVE20 bc I didn't know :(  So. so. very sad :(
20420,21646,my red eye flight is delayed even further and @JetBlue is still giving THE best service just fyi dont fly with any other airline
20428,21654,Shoutout to @JetBlue for always being my favorite airline  can't wait to get home
20434,21662,@AmericanAir Hi there. who do I contact about lost property on one of your aircraft that arrived in Chicago?
20447,21676,@AmericanAir What's the deal?  Crew is late for flight 3015 that was scheduled for 6:05a out of DFW?  Let's not play games again today.
20455,21686,@SouthwestAir just curious why the sale fares always have DAL to MDW but never DAL to STL and it's shorter?
20457,21688,Hi @DeltaAssist I'm having issue looking up flights online. Keep receiving this error. but dates entered are correct. http://t.co/xR4c0aaiEo
20458,21689,@AmericanAir FYI - there is a broken seat on flight 53 from DCA to LAX. 15C's recline button is busted.
20459,21690,My sweetheart my dear. I'm coming to you. There's nothing to fear. I'm flying @jetblue!
20464,21696,@united luggages were thrown out of flight ua5706 like flies coz trailer was broken. I guess I forgot to pay handling charges.
20465,21697,Had a terrible experience with @united this weekend. Sent complaint in via http://t.co/eyxevNWcxv. but &lt; 200 characters for a complex issue?
20466,21698,The problem w having really really old planes @AmericanAir flight makes emergency landing after cabin walls buckle http://t.co/llZ2F9ZNaV
20467,21699,@united No since I had to take a connecting flight. I wish I could to find a solution to my problem.
20474,21706,@united UA444 captain's alarm did not go off this morning? Everybody is waiting and it's too early. please show up so we can leave.
20475,21707,"I'm traveling with my cat home so I pay $12.50 for ""early check in"" and I'm still B23 on @SouthwestAir ?! What a waste of money!"
20476,21708,Hey @JetBlue I'm waiting with bated breath for you all to start flying to other locations out of Philly other than Boston.
20490,21724,Last weekend I couldn't imagine how my experience with @AmericanAir could be any worse. Looking back. at least the walls didn't fall off.
20495,21729,Lol at another delay. Do any @AmericanAir flights run on time? Was scheduled to be home last night at 8:30. 
20496,21730,Trying to leave MDT since Sun and will. as of now. arrive IAH 5 hrs late. Is this a @united issue or an MDT issue? Every flight is delayed!
20498,21732,@AmericanAir MIA to PNS canceled yest evening. Any open seats on any of the flights today? I'm stuck waiting til tomorrow.
20509,21743,@SouthwestAir bad news is I probably will never see her again ;(
20510,21744,My mother's flight was delayed. She's coming home from California tonight. I believe on @JetBlue. I LOVE that airline.
20518,21753,Pro tip @AlaskaAir. check your planes for maintenance BEFORE you put everyone on. 2hr delay = missed connections = $600 loss
20519,21754,Air stewardess on @JetBlue was horrific. smile u miserable melon
20529,21767,"@SouthwestAir Please revisit the ""10 minute"" rule.  Especially when the reason is a 45 minute wait on security. #9to13minutesmyass"
20532,21770,Every time I give @united a chance they break my heart. Stuck in Chicago. Again  #arghhhhh
20552,21791,"HAHA with all the horror stories. really??""@united: Weve got your back. no matter where you fly. https://t.co/9NtwL1VQVE"
20558,21798,@JetBlue I need a reasonable flight for FLL to BOS ON 12/1 for a student returning to school. rate online is $422 one way... That's insane
20564,21806,Switch to firefox. I think @united failed to make it easier to use. Having a pin with a bottom silkscreen.
20582,21828,@AmericanAir yesterday my flight was cancel in dallas and you sent me to Ramada Hotel please DONT DO IT AGAIN looks like a horror moviehotel
20583,21829,Never flying @VirginAmerica again based solely on safety video.  #douchechills #bringbackthecartoon
20591,21841,@SouthwestAir Sales never apply to dates that I need to travel....
20596,21846,Hi I have missed you @AmericanAir
20599,21849,@AmericanAir hope you're plane not too badly damage :-(
20608,21858,Evidently @SouthwestAir has a new policy where if you don't cancel your flight 10 minutes prior to takeoff. you lose your credit.
20613,21863,@AmericanAir didn't check me in like it said it did . so I missed my flight and I'm not going home and I'm gonna miss a funeral 
20624,21875,Clear blue skies east of Mississippi and @united can still find a way to be delayed 2 hrs.
20625,21877,@JetBlue  Jetblue is my FAVORITE cuz 'ill never miss a deal . I buy my tickets with confidence knowing I can get a credit if the fare drops!
20646,21899,no flights to nashville. @southwestair? i should've known since y'all don't even fly into ord.
20659,21913,@JetBlue thanks for the deplane from smell of fire but we have no clue what actually happened. Does not make anyone happy out here waiting
20666,21920,Two flights on @SouthwestAir yesterday. First delayed 15 min. second delayed 35 min. #SWA. you've gotta improve: http://t.co/02IBpVtjvY.
20670,21924,Never ending issues with @united. Bought my ticket on http://t.co/881E3wEq3g. they say they lost it (?) and agents are gone on lunch. #SFO
20675,21929,@SouthwestAir  once again trying to go home #puertorico and flight is delayed. Been trying to leave since yesterday.
20682,21936,@AlaskaAir again having to deal with checking in with an employee who doesn't know your pet policies. Pretty frustrating.
20688,21942,I miss that NYC skyline. @AmericanAir #TailTuesday http://t.co/rWcVSuhYTx
20697,21953,@JetBlue Why the delay Boston to SFO #0633? Thanks
20715,21972,@SouthwestAir 2/2 of my flights delayed today guys.
20719,21977,@VirginAmerica thank you for always taking care of us with love. wifi &amp; power! Flew another airline that had none. You were truly missed!
20721,21979,.@VirginAmerica Kinda hate the follow-and-DM approach. Think others interested in where your iOS app is too. Seems strange it's missing?
20730,21988,@JetBlue What happens if we miss our connection? Would we get on the next available flight for free?
20731,21989,"@AmericanAir that's weird. I don't see any red ""DELAY"" sign anywhere on that app."
20735,21993,@SouthwestAir always screws me over
20741,21999,Loving the new service to #Detroit @AlaskaAir -- but you need better signage at the ticket counter. Lots of us lost trying to check-in!
20749,22007,Not sure what to say about @united airline. If there is one airline to avoid this is the one. Delayed to Denver not sure for what reason
20756,22014,@AmericanAir what happens if i miss a flight?
20758,22016,@DeltaAssist broken. So we have de planed and now on another flight. Why would they have us board if they knew the radios were broken?
20759,22017,@SouthwestAir - Please tell me what the issue is with flight 789 out of Austin?  Waiting in the cabin 30 minutes past arrival with no word.
20763,22021,@AmericanAir 2 of us coming in on aa2901 connecting to aa1092 with very short connection. Will 1092 wait on us? It's our last shot for PHL
20766,22024,Easily the most annoying thing while traveling. @united #1stWorldProblems http://t.co/5TClPTDf1d
20786,22047,@AmericanAir Please ask them why when it was AA fault did they not refund me for outward and inward flights so only for 4 out of 6. Thankyou
20788,22049,@AmericanAir landed late in MIA and caused me to miss my connecting flight. Been traveling all day &amp; the best that can be done is a reroute?
20793,22054,@united my seat's directv channel changer was broken and I couldn't give you my money (or watch Tammy) as a result. Sad pandas all around.
20798,22059,Was impressed w/ 2 @VirginAmerica flights in row took off &amp; landed on time. but have now been sitting for 15 mins waiting to pull into gate.
20803,22064,@DeltaAssist Not yet. Im late for meeting and rush off. How can I do this? I fly home the 17th to vps.
20805,22066,Waiting to see if #1042 will take off due to weather. The desk guys are great and keep stressing safety. even internally. Thanks @JetBlue!
20811,22074,booked a holiday flying with @united hope the flight isn't as bad as the reviews 
20819,22082,Got switched to the earlier direct flight back to NYC.....with an upgrade. In situations like this. I'm glad I left United for @americanair
20828,22093,Really @VirginAmerica ?! Guess who I will no longer support since you cut ties with SeaWorld?
20829,22094,Listen @AmericanAir. I am not ok with you holding my Michael hostage on the tarmac. #lame.
20842,22107,@AmericanAir what will be the configuration for first and/or business.  Can't wait to fly it!
20843,22108,I feel the need to apologize to whatever unfortunate person was running @united's Twitter account yesterday. I wasn't mad at you. Sorry.
20861,22127,Flight got delayed 3 hours so @VirginAmerica started playing a game show with us. I feel like I'm 5 and I love it.
20862,22128,@DeltaAssist my friends luggage lost en route ATL to PRG via CDG.. No idea when it will arrive 12hrs later. Call +420775950199
20864,22130,@AmericanAir We were all asked to de-board from 4273. No updates yet on when (or if) we'll leave tonight. Any ideas?
20869,22135,@united inbound flt frm SNA was delayed it to gate for flt to YYC where I had biz class. Was told I couldnt board bc rem from flt

20885,22152,@AmericanAir can your flights be anymore slower #stuck #whyme #needtogohome
20886,22154,@united .no. I need the connection to wait for the 6+ ppl that are late from Boston to D.C.. not our fault
20906,22175,@SouthwestAir 150 passengers on flight #1699 to miss their connections at BWI.  Due to some paperwork. Been in BWI for 9 hrs.
20908,22177,@VirginAmerica how can #77 IAD-SFO be nearly 3 hrs. late?? We just were offered free water--big deal!
20911,22181,Had a not-so-great flight last night on @AlaskaAir. Felt forgotten in the back of the plane &amp; had to wait an hour+ before I got any water.
20913,22183,My family got stuck in Chicago because their @united flight was late and they missed their connection. Poland all over again. #thanksunited

20950,22222,@SouthwestAir I'm in Chicago. Disappointed.

20961,22233,@SouthwestAir too bad it's just DALLAS 
20962,22234,.@SouthwestAir can't wait to fly direct from MDW to DAL for Christmas! So much easier than DFW.
20966,22238,@SouthwestAir The LUV airline? SW BROKE EVERY SINGLE FEDERAL LAW for flying with a service dog today!! MISSED MY SONS WEDDING EVENT. PAY!!!!
20970,22242,@AlaskaAir as830 is late for 3.5 hours and still being pushed later. I won't fly alaska again.

20994,22269,@united Increased layover to 16 hours in upcoming trip from Vadodara. India to Seattle.USA without contacting on a confirmed tkt. Ruthless
20995,22270,@AmericanAir he is on runway waiting for ground crew!
21000,22275,@AmericanAir I'm home 24-hours later. Weather--not your fault. But pulling seat AFTER printing boarding pass was not a bad move on AA's part

21015,22290,Yes I'm upset my bags got lost by @SouthwestAir but mostly just because my Trader Joes Oreo cookie butter was in it
21018,22293,@AmericanAir I can't wait to see what she'll look like!
21028,22304,@DeltaAssist random seating change into a much worse seat for a redeye. Why? Flt attendant didn't care. Poor form tonight. HMA4YB
21031,22307,Hey @AlaskaAir thx for the uncooked chicken dinner! Even the crew made disgusting faces as they threw it away for me http://t.co/pwkzGQEqjv
21032,22308,@united just cancelled UA926 from SFO to FRA after a 4h wait and threw us off board. Now they have 3 premier booths open and people go crazy
21033,22309,@AmericanAir 6 hours later.... Without apologizing for inconvenience.
21040,22316,@united the adventure/tech Google earth view has shown me places I would have never knew existed that were close.  Ski trails &amp; beaches!
21046,22322,@DeltaAssist booking to LHR in Feb. Why is $300 cheaper to book through RCA (via ATL) than just to leave from ATL? Same atl-lhr leg.
21050,22326,@united Sorry. but 604 closed door earlier than needed. w/ pax waiting. stranding them. I'm generally very forgiving. This was unacceptable.
21057,22333,What the heck is a mosaic customer? @JetBlue
21059,22335,Hey @DeltaAssist please turn down (or off) the awful boarding music for any flight before 10am. It's painful and nobody likes it. Tx.Mike
21064,22340,@SouthwestAir missed my flight because of security. Lady tells me it would inconvenience the flight to let us on. WTF?
21072,22349,@AmericanAir just informing you how bad your competition is - never had such problems with you
21073,22350,Why ask me to DM you @United if you never plan to answer? #NotSurprised #CustomerDisservice http://t.co/Ucj0AQGdir
21075,22352,@SouthwestAir LUV that operational efficiency at BWI! Landed 30m early. Parked at gate 5 minutes late.
21077,22354,Plane's defroster doesn't work. so we wait till the sun comes up... @AmericanAir #maintenance
21086,22364,Extreme lack of urgency on delayed @JetBlue airways flight 1347. Going to miss connection.

21094,22372,Was upgraded to first. checked in and my seat had been given away and I got moved to 25A. What the heck @AmericanAir? Very upset. #platinum
21096,22374,@united yes but they arent fast enough. I think its a process issue not a technical one
21100,22381,@AmericanAir How long should one expect to wait to receive a refund on a refundable ticket?
21107,22389,http://t.co/PtqfULOyxR was late for flight. @united gave away his seat. He's mad: 'Do you know who I am?'...no. http://t.co/lHEDh0LCUU
21120,22403,@united check-in at Terminal E at IAH - lane lines didn't match kiosks and it was almost riot conditions. Waited 40 minutes!
21122,22406,@AlaskaAir Yes it did. A very nice TSA agent assisted us. We fly Alaska frequently and have never had this experience before.
21123,22407,@DeltaAssist we missed our layovers because of crew delays and we will arrive late to Warsaw and miss our ferry to Helsinki.
21129,22413,@DeltaAssist i tried booking a trip 3 days in a row on http://t.co/o3gQIejOvh - try to pay and price increase by 11.000$ -bait and switch :(

21150,22436,I feel like @united is like an over-eager product team: they know we're going to be delayed. but. they won't admit it until the last minute.
21153,22439,@SouthwestAir Hats off to the staff and flight crew in Omaha that got Flight 1715 to Chicago. a little late. but we made it!
21157,22443,First class cabin on @jetblue 2 LAX is bigger than my place in NYC. Do they give you a seat assignment or an apt #?  Too bad I'm in coach.

21196,22488,@DeltaAssist doesn't have any against working in Ottawa.  After 10 minutes on the phone I was told to wait
21210,22503,It seems that all but @SouthwestAir are intent on making air travel in the US as unpleasant as possible. Don't nickel and dime us.
21218,22512,@JetBlue Not an issue per se. just a discrepancy. Thankfully. it's N/A to me but heard it over the PA at MCO.

22215,23588,Hey @AlaskaAir I'm stranded in the back in a middle seat for the next 6 hours. Not cool at all. 
22224,23597,Official. @virginamerica Flt to DC boarded everyone and then deboarded. Assuming a plane issue. TripIt says 330 dep time now. We'll see. 
22227,23600,Booking my November USA trip. So far amazed by UX of @VirginAmerica web site and frightened by New York hotel prices - never paid that much.
22229,23602,@united My boarding pass does not have a space between my first and middle name. Is this going to be a problem?
22242,23615,Why did @AmericanAir kill the iOS 7 app?  I don't want to upgrade to iOS 8. Why do you care if I use an old app?
22243,23616,. @AlaskaAir nice crew on flt 3468 made arriving 90 min late OK. Q: r seats designed to be so uncomfortable or does it just hapn that way?
22252,23626,@AlaskaAir Never before been stuffed into a middle seat so cramped it doesn't even have a seatback pocket. so congratulations on that.
22257,23633,@united DO NOT and I repeat do not. let the regional carrier mess with the scheduled ewr to alb by taking our plane. ua4780 #1k #mm
22260,23636,@JetBlue now they say 10:30! It's ridiculous ! Not calling me I have to call them! Have to stay home on fri nite to wait! Shitty service
22262,23638,@JetBlue late again seem this is your new normal flight 1579 to fll.  Oh and the 109 screaming children are a real treat.
22266,23642,Ok @AmericanAir. i need flt 369 to push for max speed to dfw. Late As it is. I'm looking at less than 30 mins to get to my next flt to msy
22268,23644,@AlaskaAir It's just an inconvenience and the 2nd time my trip to and from Seattle and my bf who plays for the Seahawks spends $ on Alaska
22271,23648,@united  No one was at the lost baggage office at BNA and we had to leave. Is there a number to call or should we come back later?
22284,23662,Flght to JFK super full. no 90 min late and counting. Any love. or vouchers @virginamerica ?
22290,23668,@DeltaAssist u wait till I scan my mobile boarding pass to tell me that you chnged my selectd seat from an exit row to the back of the plane
22297,23675,Always carry your @SouthwestAir drink coupons even if you aren't traveling SWA. Never know what might change. Paying for my wine now. #fail
22303,23681,@AlaskaAir as an #MVP member. its unfair that the last 7 rows of this 737 were denied #digiplayers based on seating chart. #NotHappyBoutIt
22333,23716,@DeltaAssist Delta CS said that a technical glitch caused an issue I had upgrading tickets today.  I got charged but we are still in coach.
22341,23725,Thanks @AlaskaAir for this delayed flight out of SFO. From what I understand it's your guys error too.  #rude
22349,23733,".@SouthwestAir An extra $25 for mid-B group boarding passes isn't worth an ""early bird"" fee.  If you can't guarantee an A group. waste of $$"
22361,23745,Thanks. @AlaskaAir for getting me on an earlier flight cuz my original flight was delayed so I don't have to miss my last connecting flight
22362,23746,@AlaskaAir The capt came out of the cockpit to explain a delay and talk about our route in a refreshing way. Awesome! #1stAAtrip #notthelast
22372,23756,Left wallet on @United flight. 10 minute connection. had to leave it behind. Here's how it turned out: http://t.co/w5J2EtKoXx

22389,23775,@VirginAmerica First time ever flying with you guys today and I must say I never want to fly with anyone else #WorldClassAirline
22397,23784,@AmericanAir u killed support for the iOS 7 ver of ur app? Forced upgrade to iOS 8. Guess this EXP will be w/o AA support for a while. :-(
22402,23789,@AlaskaAir #fail Thanks for scaring me into checking my bag then trashing my #luggage http://t.co/2Yu19Muhd3

22438,23830,"@united then you should technically say. ""we will NOT do everything to find your lost item"" correct?"
22451,23843,@SouthwestAir what the heck did you do to my bag?! http://t.co/CFbEjL2utC
22452,23844,so. you're wondering about my trip to #NicheParent14 ? Come see why after this. @SouthwestAir is no longer my choice. http://t.co/rv9jUg4aZl
22455,23847,@DeltaAssist paid $836 to fly LGA to IAH and now delta wants to charge me $263 for $13 fare difference to fly a day earlier! Terrible.

22509,23907,@AmericanAir The programming available on today's flight included aa documentaries and poor movie purchase options #getbetterentertainment

22635,24043,@DeltaAssist App shows I'm on upgrade list #437. but monitor at gate doesn't show my name. Only an hr flt. so not a real issue. but weird.

22656,24064,@united Dropped the ball on my flight - lies lies lies
22680,24090,@AlaskaAir Not bad. but the elements in the flight search box seem like they could use a bit more spacing vertically - looks cramped.
22686,24096,@AmericanAir #NYC #LGA USAir integration could be better. Nowhere to wait for incoming daughter at TerminalC to sit. Bad

22724,24137,Has anyone noticed that most tweets to @AmericanAir are complaints?
22729,24143,@AmericanAir what weird thing have you done to your frequent flyer program.  Your website says I don't have a advantage number. #frustrated
22732,24146,@SouthwestAir I hate flying with anyone but Southwest. You guys are the best. please don't ever change what you do!
22748,24162,@AmericanAir I understand that you are retiring all of your MD-80 fleet and replacing with 737-800. Do you know when last MD-80 will leave?
22750,24164,@united is terrible. $300 change fee + baggage = a turd of a airline. I'll stick with the flying school bus #southwest
22753,24168,My mom just shared with me her horror story with @SouthwestAir and their idiotic pet allergy policy. Considering not flying with them again.
22756,24171,@DeltaAssist no problem.  Hope she gets some etiquette training!
22762,24177,@JetBlue annoying to board plane 30 minutes late while it sat at gate empty. now find missed takeoff slot and 18 planes ahead of us at JFK.
22770,24185,Giant guy on the plane in front of me almost broke his seat leaning back. I thought my legs were going to be broken for a sec. /cc @united

22814,24230,Fly @SouthwestAir if you sometimes like to save a buck and consistently like to leave over an hour later than scheduled.
22817,24233,@united any reason why terminal c-1 security is shutdown? A lot of people are going to miss their flights?? Final boarding is in 20 minutes
22829,24246,Soooo @jetblue moved my flight up by three hours. Not awesome; I'll probably miss it.
22834,24251,So glad I've used my miles so I never have to fly @united again!!
22840,24259,@JetBlue any clues as to why flt 1815 is delayed?

22855,24274,@AlaskaAir I am flying w/an infant and called to ask to switch seats and was told out of luck. but I can change on line. Why?
22857,24276,We often complain about airlines on Twitter. But today. @United got me to IAH 15min early so I didn't stress about my connection. 
22866,24286,In Chicago now and my flight to Vegas with @united is delayed.

23597,25066,@deltaassist Can you cancel my upgrade request on a PNR? Had to buy via Delta agent &amp; upgrade went through automatically.
23613,25083,@VirginAmerica Your website is NOT working!  Perhaps you should send a tweet about it being down!
23614,25084,@SouthwestAir Why the delay of flight 329 from MKE to MCO tonight?  No weather in the area of either airport. Other SW flights on time.
23623,25093,"@AmericanAir  ""We're sorry for your disappointment. Mike."" But not sorry enough to actually do anything about it?"
23630,25101,The drive to DFW is worth it if the option from #luv is to arrive in NYC with no bag @SouthwestAir #disappointed :(
23631,25102,A five hour long ad?! Excuse me while I blow out my brains. What is wrong with @VirginAmerica http://t.co/Vjd10MbO2Z
23633,25104,It's gotta be at least 95 degrees in the @united terminal C at Newark. A/C is either broke or shut off.
23634,25105,Been on hold with @united for about 5 minutes. It took me 4 minutes to realize their hold music was a remix of their theme song.
23637,25108,@DeltaAssist I'm looking at a trip to FLA. If I book now &amp; don't get refundable flight. Can I cancel if I have to?
23639,25110,@SouthwestAir abysmal internet on one of your flights today. things like http://t.co/7V34Tsnd5M resulted in this... http://t.co/G8DapzjvLp
23643,25114,@united yeah found that out after you broke my wheel. Most know the phrase: you break it. you buy it. Guess not for your airline. Noted
23644,25115,I guess you really want me to leave huh @VirginAmerica ?  http://t.co/3BgMBFQjnC
23649,25120,@JetBlue Looks like Fl325 from JFK TO TPA is almost two hours late for 2nd day in a row. Proper crew was not available. Is this a surprise?
23659,25130,@VirginAmerica I would literally never take another airline if you guys flew to Houston. Ever. You're the best!
23668,25140,@united I purchased a ticket with trip insurance because of the possibility that I would no longer be able to travel..I need to cancel but

23693,25165,@VirginAmerica Hi. can you please direct me to the link online where I can add my missing Elevate points for my previous flights? Thank you.
23694,25166,@VirginAmerica Thanks... but such a basic feature. Is it broken or designed that way?
23700,25172,.@united I'm flying on #TK9 worried that I'll miss connecting UAflight due to delayed arrival to LAX. Advice? Traveling w/ small child
23722,25198,@DeltaAssist 4 of us stuck in DAL going to HSV but the delayed DAL to ATL leg will make us miss the connection. Can you work some magic?
23726,25202,Have to say. #tsaprecheck is totally worth the hassle I had to go through to get it. @VirginAmerica What was I waiting for?
23728,25204,@DeltaAssist hi! Currently onboard DL413 and eqmnt change kicked us out of EC. What do we do about getting  amenities? Pay and reimburse?
23736,25213,@AlaskaAir Not asking for much. captain could update us. Never did.
23737,25214,@JetBlue so I buy an upgraded seat and you board the front of the plane last then there's no overhead bins. Smdh never again

24192,25701,props where it's due.. @JetBlue's in-flight live TV means I'm not missing this tied up #WorldSeriesGame2 #Royals http://t.co/LTktRcvyhx
24196,25705,@AlaskaAir don't make excuses. It's flat out lying. To what end who knows. but it's a disgrace that you continue to do it. Today it's AS347.

24232,25746,@VirginAmerica lost 2 bags on this trip...
24241,25755,@Alaskaair I'm willing to put up with Delayed Flights and Cramped Seating. but does the cabin have to feel like a Bikram Hot Yoga Studio?
24244,25759,.@VirginAmerica's #LOFT Is kinda pathetic. These are premium snacks? Whatever give me drinks. http://t.co/pCshkwdL5W
24247,25762,@AmericanAir Why do you feel the need to lie to us? Would telling the truth be that hard? Flight #81
24249,25764,@SouthwestAir no! I will next time. It had been 8 years. why did I wait so I long? 
24250,25765,So done with @united !!!!!! So I earn thousands of miles but then I can't use them to book flights bc I get an error?!? Seriously insane.

24348,25873,@united with the number of people who qualify for group 1 you lost a benefit of 1st class. Group 1 2 lines longer than all others
24364,25891,I have flown on every @americanair jet from the 77W down to the MD80 this year except the 767. Cannot wait until the last MD80 is retired!

24409,25939,@JetBlue can't wait for my next flight #TrickOrTweet

24526,26072,@SouthwestAir can you tell me if flight 162 Vegas to Atlanta is on time? Board &amp; online say delayed. but at counter they told me on time...
24529,26075,@DeltaAssist This is more than an inconvenience. This is a case of dishonest baggage handling. Delta knows this happens. I will post stories
24531,26077,. @VirginAmerica never disappoints &amp; the agents at LAX are top notch! Saved my day of traveling. #untilnexttime #traveling
24537,26083,40 business days later. still waiting to get my issue with @united resolved

24544,26090,Delta switched my direct flights from Seattle to Cabo to layovers! So mad! Should have known better than to fly anything but @AlaskaAir
24546,26092,@AmericanAir really bad red eye to Chicago mang. The seats were way too cramp Mang.  #mang
24551,26097,@united airlines should be paying my salary. I spend more time waiting on their planes than I spend working. #unitedsucks

24600,26153,@JetBlue sad day. the trick is on me ;)
24601,26154,@AmericanAir Back on AA headed to DFW for SkyBall.  Once again. this pre-board music is atrocious.  It's repetitive and irritating.  Help.
24605,26158,@DeltaAssist my wife's boarding pass has the wrong middle initial on it. is that going to be a problem? if so. how do we fix it?
24614,26168,Very upset @united My birthday gift from my mom (gold cross &amp; chain) was stolen  by your staff tonight! FL #UA3575 http://t.co/63pnKe430K

24624,26179,@VirginAmerica just a waste of $40 thats all.
24628,26183,Ok. This @SouthwestAir situation gets worse. We have been movedoing to 3 different terminals in the Int. Airport...
24631,26186,Can't wait for fun in the sun @JetBlue #TrickOrTweet
24636,26191,@JetBlue Thank you! We agree :) He was disappointed he didn't get his first pair of wings. any chance we could get some?!
24642,26197,@united I understand that but the thing is that this has been a series of problems over the past few months of travel.
24644,26199,@DeltaAssist I lost an item on a plane today and want to contact the airport in Dallas to see if it was turned in. How do I do that?
24647,26202,@SouthwestAir rookie move by one of your 4 bars. have ear issues all night. never broke 30K feet. harsh descend. #training #sales #valsava
24649,26204,They just powered down our @JetBlue plane to try and fix our maintenance issue. Is this like unplugging the modem for 30 seconds?
24650,26205,The good news: I'm on the upgrade list for @AlaskaAir flight 1 tomorrow. The bad news: I'm 20 of 26. #NotHappening
24651,26206,1st time in Chicago and I'm trapped in the airport. @AmericanAir why you gotta do me like that?
24664,26219,Disappointed that @VirginAmerica doesn't have the game Doom anyone! It may have been years but I really wanted to play!
24665,26220,@JetBlue I love flying your airline normally. not tonight. Been trying to get to Austin all night. I'm tired and just want some sleep. Ugh!
24668,26224,I only hate flying when @VirginAmerica doesn't fly to my destination. Woof.
24669,26225,@DeltaAssist hi I leave detroit with you guys and connect in Toronto with westjet. will you guys give me a westjet boarding pass?
24676,26233,@SouthwestAir i broke my ear drum on your flight
24677,26234,Last few flights on @SouthwestAir always find at least 1 grumpy ass sky-waiter. Not my fault you have to work. Late and an attitude? WTF?
24678,26235,Waiting for my flight slc-jfk and a costumer is telling another customer how much they love @JetBlue I love my job. I love this company :)
24680,26237,Bad form @SouthwestAir! My partner flies 2x/week with his Brompton on other airlines. and you spend 20 min. harassing him about it in SJC?!?
24692,26249,Hey @AlaskaAir. one surefire way to upset your customers is to force them to check rollerbags. then parade them past tons of empty OH bins
24703,26260,Oh @JetBlue how you disappoint me. That was not a good night.

24737,26298,@JetBlue I would appreciate a flight credit - I receive one earlier this year after a long delay. see attached http://t.co/tCwjxqXTCQ
24738,26299,We hate you today @jetblue - this is what the start of 12 hours in JFK looks like! #loyalcustomer__ http://t.co/KW4DAXvoIo
24744,26305,@AmericanAir I imagine by not cancelling the flight they were meant to catch this morning so they can't leave untill tomorrow...
24746,26308,@AmericanAir why do you board flights before the captain gets here? on flight 317 and have been waiting for 45 min on the plane #confused
24749,26311,@AmericanAir the flight has been cancelled until tomorrow. cutting our trip a day short. However I understand it was an engine fault and
24758,26320,@AlaskaAir is overbooking flights common practice? People aren't just missing flights. they're missing valuable moments of their life.
24759,26321,I hate standing in lines at airports. This @VirginAmerica one in SFO hasn't moved for 10 minutes
24762,26324,@AlaskaAir 2372 to Spokane 0/2 this week for me. Monday plane broken delayed and again today broken and delayed. Maybe I should drive MVP..?

24804,26368,@AlaskaAir   Surprise another delayed flight from spokane to seattle. just once on time???? Just once
24809,26373,"@united we have a problem.   Apparently you need training in scheduling. Waiting for a pilot again!!!  ""United....come wait with us."""
24810,26374,@AmericanAir why can't I switch my flight 3464 to 3495. There are extra tickets available but only for gold members. I can't even pay extra
24813,26377,Hey @SouthwestAir: Better to disallow BUF&gt;LGA flights than sell someone a seven-hour trip (with layover) via Chicago. Can only end badly.
24819,26383,Come on @AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines ... you guys lost my daughters softball equipment on a 7:20 direct flight this morning #SidtballTrip
24834,26398,@VirginAmerica I had 2 items stolen out of my bag from sfo to psp last night.  Come on Virgin I don't expect this from your airlines.

24841,26405,@VirginAmerica trick question ... you're showing first class and most of us fly coach ... recline in coach means evil
24842,26406,Pancake smell is gone; wreaks of gas now. Is this normal. @VirginAmerica?
24843,26407,Flying with a large dog sux bc it means you have to fly @AmericanAir. which will probably reject the dog anyway and then cancel the flight.
24853,26417,I just luv how @SouthwestAir advertises low fares! What happen to El Paso?!?! #ripoff #southwestnolowfares http://t.co/G6hO0neiYg
24868,26436,I try to turn in unfinished wine on @AmericanAir 4334 before takeoff. FA: you have a few more minutes. dont waste it. #wisdom

24888,26457,@AmericanAir The cost of an Admirals Club membership should come with a men's restroom at EWR that doesn't smell like a subway stairwell.
24894,26465,@DeltaAssist TY! Is it worth me going to the airport + seeing if it has been turned in? It's a medium sized purse. hard to miss.
24898,26469,@DeltaAssist I hate you.  Why are you following me?
24903,26477,@SouthwestAir how hard would it be to switch a Friday morning flight to a Thursday morning flight next week?!?!
24905,26480,@united received this text while still at gate. Actually funny to me. Didn't miss my connection http://t.co/Jb1gAQsIbb
24908,26483,HOLY SHIT THERES A SERVICE PUPPY ON THIS FLIGHT! @AlaskaAir you guys are awesome. great job keep it up.
24910,26485,@united My son forgot brand new headphones on UA900 yesterday. Do you have your own lost and found at SFO or whom should we contact?
24911,26486,Really upset to see that @VirginAmerica stopped flying from LAX to PHL which is why I signed up with them in the first place.
24917,26492,Hi @SouthwestAir. because you lost my bags. I think you should give me money to go shopping. #murchisonstakeNY

24944,26520,No way to watch the game on my flight to SFO so disappointed @united
24964,26540,@united I hate this airline. Flight UA1186. The airline books a connection so tight and we fly into F terminal at the end at ORD then
24970,26547,missing my @AmericanAir flight isnt so bad after all #Starbucks http://t.co/8uxcpCD2tw
24991,26570,@JetBlue you gave me TSA pre check last 3 flights but not today. So disappointed. Why? Are we not friends any more???
24992,26571,Just 24.498 premier qualifying @united miles this year. Not sure I'll fly 502 more by 31-Dec. KILLS ME. 1st time not 1P or 1K in years.
24995,26574,This sucks. I could have rented a car and drove home quicker than this. #waitingsucks @JetBlue http://t.co/M6oL9IFDNe
25000,26579,@AmericanAir What is the policy re:overhead space in first class when there are first class passengers waiting to board?
25005,26584,"@AlaskaAir I don't care about ""7 years in a row"". how about ""enough leg room in a row"" (1st class)? Worst in the US! http://t.co/0dngYoEX2c"
25015,26594,@AmericanAir I'm going to be flying to JFK in a couple of weeks! can't wait to see your wings ;)

25120,26704,@AmericanAir seriously what is the issue with parking at O'hare? People are going to miss connections.
25133,26717,@JetBlue why do you charge so much to switch flights. I feel sad
25136,26721,@VirginAmerica Can't believe my eyes!..They arrive like Boys / Leave as Men ? http://t.co/IXsQ8gwkyb   In Chicago Wednesday Oct 28th

25208,26799,@AmericanAir as a UK citizen flying to Lima (Bolivia) via Atlanta and Miami. what visas are required? Can we leave the airport?
25218,26809,Computer problems with Delta's flight 1418 from MCO to ATL this early morning! Any news @DeltaAssist ? #computerfail #nofun
25220,26811,@DeltaAssist traveled alone with my 8 month baby only to land in london with my GATE CHECKED car seat missing. very upset.
25233,26827,"@united You've been ""handling"" the issue via email for 2 weeks and nothing has happened. You f'd up and won't do the responsible thing."
25234,26829,@DeltaAssist - DL1169 MIA-LAX delta studio not working?
25236,26831,How do I win a free flight?! @JetBlue I need to get to Vegas next Spring &amp; miss traveling your airline. Puhlease! Ty
25244,26839,@AmericanAir MD80 departing CMH late evening in late Sept. http://t.co/AT1WezaDCb
25246,26842,@united I know your load planners are always looking at stuff like this. but how about no longer flying 737s to Hawai'i? AA and DL don't.
25254,26851,"@united partner flew your airline.  Bag didn't make it  Arrived next day like this!  UA stranded him ""not our fault"" http://t.co/wRWarDJ9cb"
25256,26853,@DeltaAssist   When I input my sky miles # 2174202891 there is no reference or flight from Belgrade to Paris. and no flight or reference
25257,26854,Plane delay at ORD. Steven at @VirginAmerica desk was lovely about it tho. #Traveling
25259,26856,"@AmericanAir ""The crew didnt want to wait""?! TSA breaks dwn &amp; all flts but AA wait a couple extra min. LAME excuse. Expect formal complaint!"
25271,26869,"@united It's ""Flotaci_n"" someone missed the ""n"" at the end. And ""Flotation"" is also misspelled. "
25272,26870,@VirginAmerica thanks x100 for holding the flight door from SF to Seattle this morning! I would have missed my flight. #AmazingService !
25273,26871,@AlaskaAir taking thus afternoon's flight from ABQ to LAX. If there was a delay and I had to overnight in LA. I'd be okay with that. Hint.
25276,26874,@AmericanAir What's up with the very annoying beeps in your arrivals lounge at London Heathrow? Been happening for years!
25282,26881,@VirginAmerica Any update on the delay to San Francisco and how am I getting to Seattle? #thanks
25286,26885,.@united since status no longer guarantees Eco+ upgrade &lt;rant rant&gt;. can I pay with miles? I don't see that as an option on award chart
25289,26889,@VirginAmerica EWR to SFO for #BridgeSchoolBenefit. Delayed! If I miss a second of Vedder u owe me a trip to see PearlJam! #jk #istillluvu
25292,26892,shout-out to @AmericanAir for seating me in the front row on my new flight since I missed my original one. you deserve hugs and $500
25294,26894,@united is that my fault? Your planes. and the first one was early. I assure you that would not have been enough time with chkd bags.
25296,26897,@DeltaAssist if I had known you would place me last row I would never have purchased this ticket. #uncomfortableflight
25298,26899,I sure do wish @SouthwestAir would cancel the flight on the broken plane I just disembarked from. Rebooking is a time consuming challenge...
25302,26904,Gold - @VirginAmerica ground staff playing a word scramble game with passengers while a flight is delayed
25321,26924,.... @AmericanAir I miss you... Had to fly with the other team today :( http://t.co/XQNYaHpQWr
25327,26931,@JetBlue Did that already. They suggested filing a complaint. Did that and we're told that there would be no ... http://t.co/9HP4ZOGy92
25329,26933,@united My parents lost a full day of their vacation due to your incompetence.Zero accountability. zero empathy. zero compassion #neveragain
25330,26934,@JetBlue what is the best way to make a complaint about a specific employee? Do you have customer service desks at the airports?
25331,26935,You're kinda ruining our trip @united
25337,26941,Waiting for your call @united. I want to know why it's ok to put people in danger and not be held accountable!
25338,26942,@JetBlue came into the city just for #MintHunt waiting for #Spot10 :)
25341,26945,to the guy tryin to save a dozen seats for his family on @SouthwestAir #YouCantDoThat. but I don't feel like fighting and getting kicked off
25344,26949,Random Q @AmericanAir : if I buy tix and cancel w/no refund why don't I accrue miles? Sounds like win/win for you. You get $ + extra seat.
25355,26961,@southwestair is coming through the cabin and checking everyone's ID. Now an hour late!
25359,26965,@united really bad experience at Mexico City United Club. Family of 4 in biz class to SFO. 'no admittance for children.'
25360,26966,Hoping like hell @united doesn't leave us stranded in DC again. So far. things are looking grim as our plane is late.
25362,26968,Missing you @AlaskaAir ! #justsaying
25363,26970,.@AmericanAir is operating a 777-200ER on the prime LHR-JFK route today? Sucks for those passengers! http://t.co/q4OHVtlonC
25364,26971,I feel like I have been traveling for days.   Oh wait!   Nothing like flying 5 hours to go to the same airport @DeltaAssist compensation?
25368,26976,@united is there a way to give props to a crew?  Despite delay. Houston based crew on UA1464 was above and beyond especially up in 1st.
25370,26978,@VirginAmerica what's the scoop on lv to SF flight? Is it weather delay in SF or plane issue? Getting conflicting info. Thx.
25373,26981,Waiting to be issued a boarding pass for my @JetBlue flight to PBI.. #nonrev #birthweek #vacation
25385,26994,@JetBlue. I filed a claim. I'm just hoping I get my luggage back tonight and that nothing is missing.
25396,27007,@AlaskaAir because the change of my flight from SFO to San Jose. and the fear not arrive in tine. I had to spend 40$ in a shuttle... So bad.
25402,27013,@JetBlue my frontward facing camera is broken _

25409,27020,@DeltaAssist my parents on flght dtw-rsw.  Conf# HZDSKA.  They r in middle seats &amp; have trouble flying.  Can they switch to aisle or window?
25410,27021,@DeltaAssist: Followed and never saw anything.
25414,27025,Dear @AlaskaAir. I know I'm flying to Orlando. but do offer a 'no screaming kids' flight? Flintstone's Chewable Valium? Free drinks?
25415,27026,I now hate @JetBlue. Second time I stand in a line waiting til ALL even more speed pass. 50 second rate citizens. http://t.co/0myplVYOgJ
25421,27033,Waiting for online check in for my flight tomorrow on @SouthwestAir is NOT my fave thing to do. 
25423,27035,Although Im hoping @JetBlues in-flight cable provision works without any problem. In that case. may just be able to watch the United game!
25430,27044,Missing my family. Sure wish @SouthwestAir would be willing to upgrade my flight to an earlier time so I could've gone quicker. #FamilyMan
25450,27066,@AmericanAir making me wait again :(

25489,27108,@SouthwestAir Very disappointed to find out the Bwi-Oak nonstop has been discontinued starting next month.
25492,27111,@AmericanAir is a ripoff. $200 fee just to change your flight. that's insane
25495,27114,@united explain to me how my confirmation number gets changed mid travel and now my husband is upgraded and I am not #worstcustomerservice
25500,27119,#RamonWOW is at BOG waiting for @AmericanAir flight to ORD via DFW..your logo alone makes me feel at home http://t.co/IYDarbM8Je

25504,27123,Not sure if to be frustrated or happy with @AlaskaAir. I'll just take it in and be content.
25506,27126,I hate to break it to @AlaskaAir but my makeups not often TERRIBLE
25514,27134,@DeltaAssist I'm having issues selecting a country (Australia) as a billing address when trying to book a flight within the states.
25519,27139,.@united your cancelation fees are bull. 200$? You are going to resell that and make a killing...

25568,27190,My return leg is today and I'm very apprehensive. Have a bad feeling in my stomach that @AmericanAir will mess
25585,27209,Will probably never fly @SouthwestAir again. Unfortunate events put me at the door exactly at 'boarding time'. I found it closed.. 1/2
25594,27218,@DeltaAssist The best seat you can give a Platinum is a non reclining seat in the last row when it's your issue with a flight...

25871,27511,I really like that @SouthwestAir's new ad features an open-mouth sleeper. I've never woken up on an airplane without a desert in my mouth.
25872,27512,.@united How many customer complaints do you get about the A concourse at LGA? I bet it's a lot.
25888,27528,@united missed layover due to ground issue in Chicago tonight. 67 per night hotel. 2 7 dollar vouchers. Anything for inconvenience?
25889,27529,@JetBlue mint inaugural flight running late? Seems more like halitosis to me. Lol
25892,27532,And now we're blaming the catering for the delay? Ok. @JetBlue. this better be worth the Minting wait. #JetBlueSFO #unexpectedlivetweet
25894,27534,@AlaskaAir thanks David. I was disappointed but if that's how the plane is built - I get it.

25969,27616,@VirginAmerica why cancel philly flights? Every time i tried to fly from philly to portland . flights wouldn't come up
25981,27628,@united Hi is everything ok with flight UA116 from HongKong to NY? Is 98min delayed and its route seems awkward. Tks http://t.co/OxGgRYisoi
25991,27639,When will airfare for late June be released @SouthwestAir ?!?!?
25997,27645,@AmericanAir got caught between bad info from agent. inflexible systems. &amp; 'nickel and dime' policy. i'll write a letter to further explain.
26005,27654,@AlaskaAir Thanks for the quick reply. I missed the fine print.
26015,27664,@DeltaAssist can you please send me a link for complaints.
26017,27667,@DeltaAssist Reservation f7ljni  En route to ATL. but late.  Hope for 3:22 or switch to 5;59 flight?
26018,27668,"Guy standing next to me says this is the fourth @AmericanAir ""mechanical problem"" he's had since Friday. #CrossesFingers"
26019,27669,.@VirginAmerica has the best delay updates: on plane &amp; pilot comes on to explain SFO departure slowdown. including takeoff directionality
26031,27682,While it always makes me sad saying goodbye to my family in Seattle.  @AlaskaAir w/ its outstanding customer service leaves me all smiles!
26061,27714,I made a mistake &amp; I flew United. It was torture they are the greyhound of the sky. Can you forgive me @SouthwestAir I'll never leave again.
26064,27717,@VirginAmerica that's the problem I did call.
26067,27720,@JetBlue it is. I did my check in thru my phone and everything there as usuall is just that is taking longer that normal.
26069,27722,Prices on @VirginAmerica increased in 5 minutes? Sigh.
26079,27733,Waking up the morning after #JStUWest with the @VirginAmerica safety video song stuck in my head is totally normal right?
26082,27736,Been anxiously waiting for this day and it's finally here! @SouthwestAir #NoLimits
26088,27742,@VirginAmerica wish you didn't leave Philly!!!
26092,27746,Thanks for your patronage in our attempt to bring class &amp; elegance that has sadly been lost on our competitors - my @VirginAmerica pilot
26102,27757,idiocy of an airline will never cease to amaze.  @united has seats in earlier flt leaving now -empty. but I can't ride w/o an xtra $75.
26105,27760,First leg of flight was canceled and the second leg delayed  @AmericanAir but landed safely and at my destination #Arizona
26113,27769,"Delayed and suppose to go out at 4:25 all @SouthwestAir gate agent will say without looking at you is that ""is estimated""."
26115,27771,@united Crappy treatment not letting me on standby for earlier flight. Goodwill should be worth a lot more that a $75 change fee.
26131,27788,@DeltaAssist is it possible to upgrade to first class if we've never travelled with you before? #anniversarysurprise
26133,27790,@AlaskaAir who can I talk to about how the Wife and I are still not on the upgrade wait list even after multiple calls and were both MVP.
26135,27792,Just took my first A+ flight on @SouthwestAir guess that means they__re stuck with me now. _
26136,27793,Do ppl realize we Liv in da world of twitter? @JetBlue yur chk in lady JFK2SJC was hella RUDE!
26139,27796,"The moment when your seatmate in @united BizFirst taps you and says. ""Excuse me. are you listening to One Direction?"" #mortified"
26140,27797,_ @VirginAmerica _ There__s nothing beige about it. Kick back and fly right. #MoodlitMonday #ExitBLAH: There__s ... http://t.co/UhOQamqunz
26143,27801,That @VirginAmerica jingle has been stuck in my head since Sat _
26157,27815,@JetBlue got us home! But #JFK has us stuck waiting for a gate. But is was a beautiful trip #travel http://t.co/eLQA37JeuH
26160,27818,@united - are you trying to lose all your customer loyalty at EWR today?! Literally 80+ degrees in the terminal &amp; delaying SO many flights.
26166,27825,@AlaskaAir any more details on the mechanical issue from flight 714 on Sunday?
26168,27827,@SouthwestAir I paid $56 for my SW ticket earlier - just need to leave 1 day earlier. Maybe tomorrow the price will come down. Fingers x'd!
26169,27828,@AmericanAir why cant put us in an available earlier flight to our destination but insisted in a later flight that we will miss all our mtgs
26171,27830,@DeltaAssist Are stopovers no longer permitted on award tickets? Website is trying to charge for them all of a sudden.
26176,27835,@JetBlue already have. Our submissions are awaiting verification. Can you please look in to this. Need to travel for my cousin's wedding.
26192,27852,@united what number do I call to check status of missing luggage
26198,27858,"If you're a musician don't fly @SouthwestAir .they'll destroy your gear bc they're""not responsible for electronics""#horriblecustomerservice"
26206,27867,@united my friends purse was stolen and a plane ticket was purchased with her credit card today.. Who can I speak with to resolve the issue?
26207,27868,@DeltaAssist plane DL 4984 broke down. New plane incoming. Let's hope it also doesn't break.
26211,27872,@americanair I can't find my reference number for my luggage issue. how can I found out the results?
26217,27879,@AmericanAir actually. he got nicer after the flight took off. He must have been really stressed at the beginning.
26222,27884,Funniest kid flying solo next to Me. Nervous hes one of those lil shits who will snap a pic when I fall asleep lol @JetBlue#flyfi
26225,27888,I feel like @AmericanAir always singles me out with the lost baggage thing.. Everytime__
26227,27890,@DeltaAssist yes for the following day after already traveling all day today so I cld get back for work tomorrow but now I will miss that.
26228,27891,@SouthwestAir received my ticket confirmation via email and my name is misspelled. How do I correct this?/ will it be an issue.
26229,27892,@JetBlue Good Morning If you do not enjoy what you are doing. you will never be good at it. #ShareYourLight  - Luke Parker
26233,27896,@AlaskaAir always _. but why buy plane that can't accommodate regular carry on over row 1? I haven't had to gate check in years - sigh
26237,27900,.@JetBlue free WiFi?! Did not know thissss. Too bad it's a short flight.
26246,27910,@AmericanAir I'm so sad because I'm trying to book a flight from IAH to SAL and I saw airfare with y'all at $513. but it went up to $660 _
26248,27912,Just landed back in LA from an incredible time in #Jamaica! However flew on @AmericanAir &amp; the plan reeked of urine! Ugh
26249,27913,I hate @AmericanAir

26266,27931,Hey @JetBlue need to work on flywi. ProTip: longer flights new planes. cheaper to fly. more $ from wifi. shorter flights older planes
26267,27932,waiting for my shiny new @americanair membership card which should have come a few weeks back. and for them to process my credit requests.
26268,27933,@VirginAmerica I'm trying to fly standby more than 3 flights prior to my flight. My wallet got stolen &amp; can't pay standby fee LAX from JFK.
26271,27936,Companies need to model @JetBlue customer service. Its been a few weeks since flight and I cant wait to fly Jetblue again. #hasslefree
26283,27948,@JetBlue could have flown SW and had the time I wanted. couldn't do it. Loyal for over a decade . Can't wait to try out #jetbluemint to #SFO
26294,27959,@AmericanAir why the heck would you move ex plat to 120 - that is insane!!!
26295,27960,@DeltaAssist You saved my life.  I missed an accident on 494 because of the delays. :)
26300,27965,@AmericanAir - Too bad you upped the segment qualification for ExPlat to 120. Guess I will give 40% business to another airline now.
26302,27967,Hi @DeltaAssist. can you help me out with a flight issue?
26310,27976,@JetBlue If I am headed to NYC. I am more than likely on your planes. and this is what I can't leave home without https://t.co/yOgHCSMW2U

26347,28014,Of course my @SouthwestAir flight is cancelled. AGAIN. It's too bad I'm unable to rely on SWA for business travel. #missedappointments
26350,28018,@DeltaAssist Hi from Germany. If there's a travel warning for a state from Ausw_rtigen Amts. can I cancel my flight and get the money back?
26377,28046,@DeltaAssist So you are done with last minute deals. That's a shame. AA. USAir. and United all do them. Too bad.

26429,28100,@JetBlue if someone were to have...uh...left her new blue coat in JFK's T5. who would she contact to hear she'd never see it again?
26432,28104,@AmericanAir can't wait to go.
26437,28110,@AmericanAir any issues with pre ordering for INTL&gt;USA flts? Last two flights to the US HKG/ICN haven't shown the preorder on the manifest.
26452,28125,@SouthwestAir don't get anymore new planes until you get these and don't worry I'll wait  http://t.co/2FoHtgb7pZ

26800,28495,@AmericanAir I'm traveling on flight 1127 from DEN - ORD today with a broken ankle. Any chance of a window seat with more legroom?
26808,28505,Yay! After two full months. @united found my lost iPad and is mailing it back to me today! Never thought I'd see that iPad again.
26810,28507,@DeltaAssist I am looking for the direct number of the baggage claim office at the Atlanta Airport.  They called about a lost item

27452,29191,My parents need to realize that I will only fly @SouthwestAir. I have no problem with not coming home.
27454,29194,@VirginAmerica can you talk to lax about getting some titer food at your terminal? This burger king makes me sad tho

27515,29261,Shout out to the @JetBlue crew that took care of me flying back from Cayman with a sudden medical issue. #pro's #customerservice thankyou!!!
27519,29265,"Doors close in 2 min. You can't switch. How long does it take? ""3 min."" Oh ok. We can't or you're too lazy? @SouthwestAir seriously?"
27538,29284,"Saying a six hour delay is ""the best you can do"" is really setting a low personal best goal @united #stillinChicago"
27541,29287,Oh my god I'm never flying @united again. You guys make Southwest look like a luxury airline. UR SEATZ R 2 SMALL WE R NOT ANTZ
27548,29294,.@united just yanked me out of business class to downgrade me if anyone's curious how much they've sucked today. Not even an apology for it.
27551,29297,@united deplaned everyone on DEN-MSP. gave that plane to flight bound for LGA. Turns out MSP bound plane is broken. No updates. No answers.
27559,29306,Mechanical troubles delaying us in SeaTac. No prob. @AlaskaAir has spare plane waiting so they can get us on our way. #iflyAlaska #nohassle
27577,29324,@JetBlue I'm very disappointed to find out that you charge $150 to change a flight. I will keep that in mind the next time I book a trip.
27584,29333,@united Many of us are coming in late to ORD. Flt:987 to CDG shows on time but it can't be. Is there an updated status?
27585,29334,@VirginAmerica So flight delay for #210 sfo to ord is snow? Just curious! Not hard feelings
27588,29338,@SouthwestAir cancels my return trip because I missed a connection due to their problems.I call for a new flight:can't email me confirmation
27603,29353,My wife and I were supposed to have a flight to London tonight. Could've been at the Emirates for kickoff. but @AmericanAir has fucked us.
27605,29355,Seriously @AlaskaAir?! The weather is an issue in Mammoth. and you're delayed with a mechanical issue? Come on! LAX -&gt; MMH Flight #2196
27612,29363,Voluntarily giving up your carry on to check because plane is full maybe a bad idea. @JetBlue has yet to find my luggage!
27622,29374,@united but it should be for delays that cause missed flights and missed wedding ceremonies
27626,29378,@United Any chance that UA743 will make it to ORD from BUF tonight? Updates keep pushing out time &amp; its getting late.
27633,29386,Another bad sign: @united is de-icing planes at ORD. Is it really cold enough to demand de-icing? In Oct?! http://t.co/IOYZbmgs3O
27635,29388,@united you always find a new way to disappoint. Stuck at ewr.
27651,29405,@united ya. too bad flight was delayed 4 hrs into #Chicago and I missed my connection to #dusseldorf. what now??
27653,29407,@AmericanAir can u tell me if flight 1277 from CLT to MIA is still scheduled to leave tonight &amp; will wait for my connecting flight US 1897
27654,29408,@united we finally took off - just wished they could have kept us more updated during the wait.

29178,31023,@SouthwestAir Trying to add my knowntraveler# to my reservation to get TSA Pre-Check but can't find a place to do so-am I missing something?
29188,31033,@AmericanAir if your customer service merges with US Airways then you are but trouble.  US Airways is horrid.
29193,31038,@SouthwestAir cannot wait to take selfies with my flight attendants on Thursday. #iflysw #peanutsplease

29234,31080,I guess Pelosi just lost her 757 private jet.  Time to sign up for @AmericanAir  Advantage program.
29238,31084,@VirginAmerica I was hoping that the move from DFW to DAL would prevent slow ramp traffic. but it doesn't help when YOU clog the ramp!
29243,31089,@AlaskaAir umm. there is no crew for flight 2282 from Seattle to Kalispell that is supposed to leave in 3 minutes. You guys are a joke.
29247,31093,@AlaskaAir does the best job of all the airlines in calling their customers liars and training rude supervisors.
29249,31095,I dropped off my suitcase that was damaged by @united (https://t.co/9FMAQvqE3P) on September 7th.  Got it back today.  Not exactly speedy.
29251,31097,@VirginAmerica I hate you. VAA. now that you stopped flying to Philly. You were my best way to get home. now I'm screwed. :(
29254,31100,@VirginAmerica Love love love the branding &amp; #mobilefirst website but why oh why the horrible interface for your job applications. #crying
29256,31102,Flight is delayed.... You had one job... @AlaskaAir
29263,31109,@DeltaAssist Sure. *I* was late. My own fault. I wasn't mad or rude. Attempting to rebook  later flight TWO separate Delta employees WERE.
29265,31111,@DeltaAssist as we board they are getting worse!  Never fly delta again...
29269,31115,@VirginAmerica i love virgin and been a customer forever. My flight attendant from lax to jfk was the worst last week. Guy named Jamie.
29270,31117,.@AmericanAir is ruining my 26th birthday. Is this as catchy as the Uber girls plea? Say your sorry with a few drink tickets. American.
29271,31118,"First #nonstoplove flight on @SouthwestAir can't wait ""not to stop"" on the way to ATL. FAs all billboard-worthy."

29316,31167,@DeltaAssist - fyi the http://t.co/0UPemMwydf site is switching to text only when I log in - is there an issue with it?
29325,31176,@united Why is it less to fly Philly&gt;EWR&gt;Orlando than from EWR&gt;Orlando? Why can't I just buy that Philly ticket and leave from Newark?
29329,31180,@SouthwestAir FLT 165 cancelled? No weather problems in OAK or SAN? What's the prob? Tickets&lt;fuel cost so cancel?
29330,31181,@AmericanAir So many flights were 3 hrs late leaving John Wayne Airport yesterday that you need it narrowed down?
29332,31184,45 minute wait to talk to a human being at @AmericanAir?! #justwannagethome
29333,31185,@AmericanAir Wow....30 minute wait time calling AAdvantage services with no option for a call back? Merger taking its toll??
29336,31188,@AlaskaAir Michael - what can you do when wife hangs up and starts crying and yelling about service? It wasn't bad - it was offensive DM?
29341,31193,@AmericanAir I once stood outside an Admirals Club during a delay.
29347,31200,@AmericanAir lost my wedding ring at LAX while flying home to AKL mths late passing thr LAX again you guys had found my ring #toastto75years
29349,31203,@united done. Most unsatisfactory. A voucher that I medically can't use doesn't make up for the farce that I endured.
29355,31209,@AmericanAir I've never been in an Admirals Club. Will you please make a memory for me? #Toast75Years
29356,31210,Here's the plane that @united won't let me board as they load luggage on it. last time they lost my bags...I'm done. http://t.co/BSpEiRpw2B

29360,31215,First flight delayed. Hoping to make my connection in JFK on my way home :-( /cc @AmericanAir
29366,31221,@AmericanAir let's try loading the plane from back to front? Do you have a team constantly working on how to make travel more unpleasant?
29369,31224,I want to extend a very gracious THANK YOU! to @VirginAmerica for recovering my lost iPad after my flight from #JFK to #LAX #lifesaver
29370,31225,I knew I should have stuck with flying on @VirginAmerica. When I deviate to others I get burned. Or charged an arm and leg. Lol
29379,31234,@SouthwestAir can I have two more drink tix? Don't wanna leave my 2 coworkers left out #everyonedeservesadrink _flight from MDW-&gt;MCO

29394,31251,@SouthwestAir supposed to leave at 245 and still no plane..
29398,31255,@AmericanAir #Toast75Years the kids room in lax admiral club is the best for waiting with my child for a flight
29405,31262,@AmericanAir reported app issue last Sunday. Still not fixed. ETA?

29428,31287,Priority baggage tags are meaningless when you fly into rdu.   Always wait forever for my bags from AA in rdu.  @AmericanAir
29432,31291,@AlaskaAir I have bad luck. Flight 670 delayed out of SEA. We are supposed to go in 5 minutes but nothing happening so probably not!
29436,31297,@DeltaAssist  what's causing the delay on 3494 MSP to GRB???
29437,31298,@JetBlue your kiosk and mobile check in may need some kind of update - both told me I was too late to check in but I wasn't
29439,31300,@DeltaAssist How do I know what gate I arrive at and will leave from for connecting flight?  Trying to map out our layover tomorrow
29442,31303,@united how is your wifi keeping me connected when it doesn't work outside the US?  Are satellites illegal in Mexico? http://t.co/ZYeYnc5Bvu
29444,31305,I have to wait till the local time in New York City (at JFK) is past 7:15p to be able to check-in for my transcontinental first @AmericanAir

29464,31329,@united I missed my flight to MSP today because I had to fly somewhere else. What happens to the missed flight tickets?
29467,31332,@JetBlue once again app and web check-in not working- can you please fix this thing? #annoying
29471,31336,@DeltaAssist are you holding flights at ATL due to tram malfunction?? Thousands stuck underground trying to walk to term
29472,31337,@AmericanAir how long am I going to have to wait for your people to contact me about my refund question?
29476,31341,This airplane smells like a port-a-potty :( AA48 @AmericanAir
29482,31347,@united sayin we smell like alcohol. which we dont. and even if we did you sell it on the plane. So if we have a drink mid flight what then?
29489,31354,@DeltaAssist flight 2279 delayed msp to sjc. Possibility of getting on 930am tomorrow instead?
29494,31359,@SouthwestAir Your customers need more Luv in passenger comfort: respect us and increase the seat room. We are all miserable...
29502,31367,@united I'm tryna get her airline ticket switched and you are making it very expensive to switch different dates
29506,31371,@united leaving San Francisco  miss it already!!! http://t.co/P1wMabGFxL
29512,31378,@AlaskaAir now I'm back in coach. Not sure why I lost my upgrade bc someone didn't check in on time.  He should've been put back in coach.
29518,31384,@JetBlue I requested trueblue points about a week ago. what's the wait?
29520,31386,After today. I don't think I'm going to be flying @AlaskaAir again. So unprofessional. Stressed. and I just want to be with my family.

29528,31394,Really @JetBlue ? Delayed because you have to scotch tape an overhead door shut?? Maybe fix your planes! #hopeitholds http://t.co/5p922inzo8
29530,31396,@united the problem was that some woman took seat next to me without politely asking. Just think there should be general courtesy there.
29533,31399,Just booked spring break to Punta Cana through @JetBlue!  Wohoooo cant wait for March!
29534,31400,Wow. Really @AlaskaAir? $125 for push back out of Kalispell? Even after you never sent my flight info? Last time I fly Alaskan.
29539,31405,@southwestair. my god.  Getting in-flight wifi via the credit card pymnt on a Droid galaxy s4 is best described as hell on earth.  Fix it.

30326,32234,@VirginAmerica I thought my stopover in LA was going to be miserable. but the crew quickly changed that. I hope this flight gets delayed! Ha
30331,32240,What airline would you say has the best frequent flyer program? Most likely leaving @united cause of the upcoming horrid changes to theirs.

30382,32291,@VirginAmerica Really bad service. known issue with safari browser. fare gone and can't book. cust svc says try again later. not helpful
30387,32296,Stuck at ORD as @United continues to lie about our departure time. #unitedfail

30412,32321,@united UA1588 seems to be a pattern of late boarding.  The method of boarding looks like a Black Friday recipe for a nightmare.
30415,32324,@SouthwestAir is 0/2 this week... #Delayed #Chicago #Cleveland
30416,32326,When I'm late for a flight. @SouthwestAir steals my money. When they're late. they give you peanuts. &amp;VirginAmerica rules! #southwestsucks

30453,32365,@DeltaAssist can I change flights of when I want to leave if it's same day?
30456,32368,I wonder where the root of the problem is? Did the person not get off the plane when we landed in Nashville from Kansas City? @SouthwestAir

30874,32815,@SouthwestAir been waiting for mine since they told me they would send them in July...keep getting credit card apps though...
30881,32822,I left my wallet on a @VirginAmerica flight yesterday and I got it back a day later with nothing missing. Excellent service again
30888,32829,@SouthwestAir stuck at midway Chicago without meal or drink tickets. Would not be MAD if they did promise that connecting flight would wait!
30892,32833,Looking forward to my @VirginAmerica  flight 753 tomorrow. Hoping it is on time for departure. Last 10 flights have been delayed. SFO bound!
30916,32904,@united Why is it so hard to use a credit on an account? You see the credit. but cannot issue it because of a pin you never provided?
30917,32905,"Oh. and check-in is apparently different now that it's all @SouthwestAir. You no longer pick seats at check-in. It says it's ""too late."""
30925,32913,@DeltaAssist is it a problem if you don't  take a connecting flight and just stay in the connecting city? Domestic and international?
30940,32928,@united Bad turbulences on the flight Maui - San Francisco. is that normal situation over the Pacific?
30944,32932,Emmmm for some reason @AmericanAir has blocked me. I am sad.
30951,32939,.@DeltaAssist I got forcibly rebooked to a much later connection in MSP than I wanted. After I volunteered yesterday. Not pleased. GDQAE7
30952,32940,@united Missed this tweet this time but will let you know next time!
30957,32945,First time flying @JetBlue today and it's going to be my last as well. Been stuck in our plane for 2 hours on the runway 
30974,32966,@JetBlue is the #overlyattached girlfriend I never had #memories #whenwefirstmet http://t.co/gjqH4w9Ts6
30975,32967,@SouthwestAir did that last time and it got me nowhere. Maybe you guys should switch to #GoGo
30979,32972,@DeltaAssist Where can I find info about switching my flight to a later time?
30986,32979,@AlaskaAir you have to be the biggest rip off of any airline! Feel bad for Alaska residents over 700 rt to Seattle? #joke #Monopoly
30998,32991,@AmericanAir no upgrade- now 2nd -4th gets cleared before me on standby?? I get stuck in the back. http://t.co/BlEFKxn3rG
31006,32999,@DeltaAssist I hit the $1k mark. the 1000+ points have hit my acct. but my 30k pts haven't arrived.  How much longer? Flights are more now.
31009,33003,@DeltaAssist Atlanta gate T0 flight 930. Disappointed that despite craft coming from hanger it isn't here. #questionable
31010,33004,@DeltaAssist on DL0016 lax to jfk. it is delayed and I am wondering if I will be able to board my connecting flight to So Paulo DL0471.
31011,33005,@AmericanAir I'm awaiting my new debit card before my flight next week. Can I purchase flight/baggage fees with Visa Green Dot/Gift Cards?
31032,33026,@SouthwestAir I am very disappointed. My daughter and I just wanted to spend thanksgiving with my deployed husband.
31033,33027,When flying @SouthwestAir don't be mad if you don't get to sit next to someone specific. Next time check in for your flight earlier.
31038,33032,@SouthwestAir I hope so too. I'd hate to be without everything on my vacation.
31044,33038,@AmericanAir was going to tweet you today after getting work done but then got a call saying I was rebooked. #fail #failagain
31049,33043,I hate @JetBlue
31050,33044,Who just made 600 to wait 3 hours. Oversold flights  @southwestair #volunteer #fb
31053,33047,@AmericanAir   it doesn't change the fact that I will miss a business dinner. I sincerely hope I will be upgraded to first class at minimum
31058,33052,@DeltaAssist hi. My wife Allison &amp; I are flying from SFO to bos. Changing planes in Detroit. We r going to miss our conn. Have u booked us?
31061,33055,Two @AmericanAir flights this weekend. two mechanical delays to engine issues. Not sure if it makes sense to try to fly them anymore.
31066,33061,@united had extra spot in an earlier flight home but wouldn't let me switch without a $200 charge at the gate. #nolove #illuseotherairlines
31068,33064,@DeltaAssist are international tickets booked through http://t.co/ULwIOFRbSh cancel able for 24 hours?
31072,33068,Plane broken down again.. 2nd week in a row this happened to me. @SouthwestAir you guys owe me some drink tickets.
31074,33070,Washington D.C. I miss you already! _#Pentagon #U.S.AirForceMemorial #WashingtonD.C. @jetblue__ http://t.co/xj1uzKDmbp
31078,33074,@DeltaAssist Lost iPad at ATL gate B10. Found by gate crew. no time before MSP connec. Name/# are on inside cover. What should I do next?
31080,33077,@VirginAmerica Had to cancel flight bc of fam emergency. I have a doc note. Can you please tell me who to send it to to get the fee waived?
31087,33084,@SouthwestAir Why is flight 4021 to OAK delayed today? 45 minutes?
31088,33085,@AmericanAir  Frustrated in AA and USAir today had a tkt on USAir but was trying to make an earlier flight on AA told me it would be 1200.
31089,33086,@AlaskaAir I read that - it's saying the travel mid March I'm trying to book isn't eligible though it should be. Just frustrating
31090,33087,@DeltaAssist I hate the airlines
31092,33089,@united can't wait for the survey! How can so many know so little?!
31093,33090,@AmericanAir I'll do that. but it's not a printing issue. That's what the link to the mobile b pass you sent displays. Trying to save a tree
31097,33094,Oy. Just deplaned @united Flight 364 in Vegas for a mechanical issue.  What stays in Vegas is apparently me.
31098,33095,@VirginAmerica 60lb bag cost $50 more for 10lbs? Initial fee ok. extra lbs were med equipt. Couldn't leave in bag. Gonna be mad if breaks.
31103,33101,@VirginAmerica It's great so far! Though. I'm sad you only have one gluten/dairy free snack option (pears)~
31104,33102,Free in flight #Wifi. #NFL ticket &amp; cookies w/no nuts (for those of us w/allergies). I almost wish my flight was longer! Hi-5 @JetBlue!
31115,33113,Stupid toddler kicked my seat the entire flight and his mother did nothing. I need to find a way to always fly first class @AmericanAir
31122,33120,Four hours late off the gate in Chicago for HKG. How does @united not realize the pilots will go over duty limits on the way to the runway?
31125,33123,@VirginAmerica If you're going 2 leave is on the tarmac for a little while. could you at least pump fresh air pls so we don't breathe fumes?
31129,33127,Flight delayed @JetBlue. Do I get any credit? #time=money http://t.co/y69Ld8dqcd
31131,33129,What a crappy boarding process @United O'hare!! Standing 25 min in Group 5 while they board 45 standbys + army of others on 692 to LGA
31137,33135,I have the @VirginAmerica flight safety song stuck in my head. if that gives you an idea of how many planes I've been on lately
31159,33159,My second delay within three days? Just a normal thing with @AmericanAir
31167,33168,"My new fave euphemism for airline turbulence is ""lumpy air.""  I like it. @AlaskaAir!  (And the turbulence wasn't that bad anyway.)"
31176,33177,@AlaskaAir just canceled my flight home wonder if they'll reimburse me for the PTO I have to burn tomorrow. never flying again. fucking joke
31216,33219,:( @JetBlue can't book flights on your app :( it's ok. luckily I had time to waste trying multiple times before grabbing a laptop
31217,33220,@DeltaAssist when does medallion status kick in? it used to be as soon as you earned it. Do you now have to wait until the next year?
31218,33221,@AmericanAir I don't know how it always happens. but you've done it again. My flight was delayed. my connection missed. No more AA flights!
31220,33223,This is why @JetBlue is the way to go. I know I would never have had to deal with anything like this. you guys need to get a canadian stop
31225,33228,I only fly @VirginAmerica... love the way they take care of me... but got a baby kicking my seat right now :( lol http://t.co/953KokRbo2
31226,33229,@SouthwestAir If I left a copy of The World is Flat on my flight. do you deliver lost items?
31229,33232,@SouthwestAir I have yet to be on a SWA flight that has not been delayed...
31230,33233,Forced to check my bag on @VirginAmerica despite boarding 20 mins early and now having to wait 20+ mins to pick up.
31237,33240,"@JetBlue Just saw the new ""Vets in Blue"" plane!! Can't wait to fly in it one day!!!! Miss the blue family!!"
31238,33241,Hoping my @SouthwestAir flight to NYC tomorrow actually has functional WiFi. Had bad luck the last couple of flights...

31259,33262,Lost bag last week.  Stuck I'm the tarmac tonight. You're killin me @SouthwestAir.  I used to sing your praises.

31261,33264,Good news: thanks to @JetBlue I was able to watch the Bears game on the plane. Bad news: I was able to watch the Bears game on the plane....
31274,33279,i really feel like the universe is going to test me this week. Lost baggage from @AlaskaAir and missed my stop on #pdx train. Wish me luck
31281,33286,@AmericanAir lost all our sticks_
31282,33287,Not happy I'm stuck in Seattle tonight. I could be going to Vegas.. Not home for literally 24 hours.. Thank you @AlaskaAir
31301,33306,@united Folks. I'm here again at MEX. Problem remains the same. Not about me. I'm local. have connection w wireless carrier... But others...
31303,33308,Morning! Off to Indianapolis this morning. Hoping for once that @southwestair will leave on time! #wishfulthinking
31306,33311,@AmericanAir no TV. music. reading light. beer. wine or food choice made 10hr LHR-MIA flight seem far longer! Not looking forward to return
31313,33318,Wheels up was a premature tweet.  I forgot I was flying United.  @united = guaranteed delay.
31314,33319,Cold weather in boston no problem your @JetBlue plane still going out on time. Don't worry about ice #jetbluesofly http://t.co/XC7CNJWKtH
31315,33320,Thank you @JetBlue for your workers telling me I had more than enough time &amp; not letting me cut the line. Me missing my flight proves it. _
31326,33331,@DeltaAssist Thursday flight cancelled - missed doctor appt. flight delayed today  will be late to client meeting. Bad pattern developing

31358,33365,@SouthwestAir 2nd week in a row on same flight. same time from BNA to MDW and 2nd week in a row mechanical problems. Groundhog week?
31363,33370,OMG @AmericanAir Thumbs down_ to the on-board credit card offer announcements. Annoying and tacky. And insulting to your FA's.
31365,33373,@AmericanAir a clear demonstration of ineptness. Damaged airplanes and understaffed ground crews. #goingtomissmyconnection
31370,33378,@AmericanAir http://t.co/ReLhOmFCS4 having issues?
31371,33379,@AlaskaAir: others are cancelling flights to MSP. how about you?
31373,33381,Once again. no wireless on the longer segment of my @SouthwestAir flight today. Guess I'll have to do ... http://t.co/PIgZUfl90f

31388,33397,@SouthwestAir Waiting for the team to check out a mechanical issue at BNA. Tell me a joke to keep me entertained?? #EliseOnVacation
31396,33406,Frustrated to be on hold all morning @SouthwestAir trying to buy tickets for my team!  Someday they'll allow booking group tickets online!
31406,33416,@DeltaAssist flight was just delayed from LAN to MSP. will cause me to miss MSP to SLC at 2:19. Had to be at SLC by 5. Any alternatives?
31415,33426,So mad @VirginAmerica isn't flying out of Philly anymore :(
31417,33428,@JetBlue why is flight 506 so delayed??

31436,33448,Moved from NYC to NJ. Wanted to change JFK-Orlando flt to Newark-Orlando. @JetBlue wants $100 PER TICKET to make change. Disgraceful thieves
31439,33451,@AmericanAir you cannot be serious asking for every airline heard of in your survey.... You lost me there
31443,33455,Too Many Cooks is not as bad as making an online booking mistake w/ @SouthwestAir and they keep all your money. #BookSouthwestAirByPhone
31446,33458,If you book a ticket on @americanair today and the confirmation page fails. do not assume the ticket didn't book. #learnedfromexperience

31538,33559,Very poor experience with @VirginAmerica- were unwilling to admit their fault. Switched flight out of Dallas. Not flying with them again.
31539,33560,@AmericanAir stuck on the runway in ORD for 30 mins...and I gotta pee like crazy!!!! But it's ok. I still like you guys. #holdit
31540,33561,@DeltaAssist flt 3859 delay - what's the cause? Likelihood of getting out today?
31547,33569,@VirginAmerica located it on my own. Not impressed. you've set a high standard that we've come to expect. As a long-time flyer. you failed.
31561,33584,@AmericanAir It's an issue with http://t.co/zxFAwkKDRe - they have had the bags since this morning.
31565,33588,@AmericanAir renovation process takes time. But when the plane is +30 years old. there's no excuse. Coincidentally. all planes are too....
31567,33590,I booked .@SouthwestAir travel. with points in late May SMF-EWR. and early June EWR-OAK. Couldn't return to SMF - not enough points. #HelpMe

31579,33602,Problem with first plane. dead batteries on replacement.  ORD to DCA.  What's going on. @AmericanAir?
31580,33603,@SouthwestAir your open seating policy seems broken to me. Slowest board time I've experienced.

31701,33732,@JetBlue nearly got stuck in Orlando and missed our connecting flight. Instead you guys put us on a direct flight home. You guys rule.
31703,33734,@AmericanAir London to #DFW was diverted to chicago. The problem was we then had to wait almost two hours just for a printed flight plan

31819,33860,Hi @AmericanAir. Your gate agent at gate k5 at ORD is crazy. Not the best to hassle traveling mothers about non sensical procedures.
31821,33862,@AmericanAir is akin to flying back in time in the 80s.  No inflight ent and minimal leg room. #cattleclass #avoid #poorservice

31889,33934,If you book with @AlaskaAir and need to change a flight within 24h. cancel and re-book. Otherwise you only get 1 change.
31891,33936,The destination is just the excuse http://t.co/AayABwJqXF #travel #inspiration @JetBlue
31892,33937,My mommy's almost here!! Soooo excited!! Come on delayed flight! @jetblue  http://t.co/h7AaglweWP
31893,33938,@united hi! Can we leave the plane during a 1hr 45 minute layover in New Jersey on December 17th?
31894,33939,Looks like I__ll never be able to use my @VirginAmerica Elevate Points for pHawaii travel as they claimed. Might need another ff mile program
31895,33940,So .@SouthwestAir I purchased a ticket for a non-stop flight. You force me to fly to Omaha. Now my plane is broken. Another delay #Boguish
31896,33941,What sins against the gods of transport oligopoly did these poor women commit that @united won't just let them retire and die in peace?
31899,33944,Dropped off @AlaskaAir -damaged bag at repair. Less painful drive than expected. Met mascot Roy. too: http://t.co/Coetofhr9g
31903,33948,My 5-year-old can count better than @United; this LAS-SFO flight has no rows 2-7 and also is missing row 9. #shrinkinglegroom #Vegas #fail
31906,33951,"@DeltaAssist I left my jacket in a plane at Rochester (NY) airport. Is there a ""lost &amp; found"" number that I can call?"
31908,33953,Wait. sorry. I take back what I said about @JetBlue. Their website was incorrect and I got the credit in like 30 seconds. I'm an ass.
31910,33956,Seriously hoping some of these theoretical CO trips come together. This girl has some bad #wanderlust and lots of @SouthwestAir points!
31911,33957,@united 130 + RJ flights a year and the one mainline 757 I get of course the one row of TVs that are out.  Very upset http://t.co/vhzpl9ju4W
31917,33963,@SouthwestAir toying with me this morning. First a 40 minute late notice followed by a retraction.
31920,33966,So @united reports my plane is 1 hr late _cause inbound plane is late. Inbound plane is reported to arrive 9 minutes early.
31926,33973,Hey @united your plane was broken and leaking on a little girl. Don't worry I fixed it tho. http://t.co/UmbNHZsexs
31927,33974,@DeltaAssist very disappointed you advised you changed all my seats but no such thing happened for my flights today!
31928,33975,Why would anyone waste $649 for a boost to @AmericanAir AAdvantage Gold?  Especially when you can just get a Citibank card.

32773,34851,@united this is lame. So frequent flyer MILES don't matter anymore? Now it has to be $ AND miles? Screw u. http://t.co/gzITH6lZ7q
32777,34855,What I'm trying to say is do it. @SouthwestAir. Surprise Concorde comeback flights. No one would hate this.
32782,34860,@united the airlines should have assisted me earlier or i wouldn't have missed my flight. #worstserviceever
32790,34868,Just putting it out there. but if @VirginAmerica flew out of Vancouver. I wouldn't fly with anyone else. Seattle can be inconvenient. :(
32797,34876,Sad face.  @SouthwestAir forgot my drink and my row entirely. And I wasnt even asleep this time. #NotGivingaThankYouCoupon
32800,34879,@DeltaAssist learn from Zappos - when you're error = my missed connect. put me in emergency row. not back of plane when rebook.
32802,34882,@AmericanAir we have been on the plane for 30 minutes waiting for the ground crew at DFW to park us.Good thing our flight attendant is funny
32804,34884,@united failed tonight. Plane trouble and the ground crew did not know what to do. #fail
32808,34888,@united NOC in Chicago let's the plane leave! WHY?!! for a flight that was going to land early at 1:20AM!!
32809,34889,@VirginAmerica AWESOME flight team on #VX919 LAS - SFO tonight! Trista made up for the delayed departure. #virginrocks #virginamerica
32812,34892,@VirginAmerica To bad I have no to visit great rates!.

32818,34899,@JetBlue their hours have not coincided with when Im available-I will ASAP but Im very bothered your airline hasn't taken any accountability
32829,34910,.@JetBlue excuse me i have a complaint to make
32830,34911,I never get @alaskaair's SDSU plane when I fly home. That's the goal before I graduate.
32837,34918,I'll tell you this. no matter the delay. my @united pilots always make up for it in the air. Took off an hour late &amp; landed 10 mins early _
32838,34919,@AmericanAir - pathetic crew across the board on flt#181 JFK/LAX - expect more
32840,34921,"Got a call from @JetBlue. ""You're flight has been disrupted. You are no longer scheduled for this flight. We look forward to serving you."""
32842,34923,Hey @JetBlue I just got a mag saying my flight tomorrow is disrupted and I'm no longer on it. yet you gave me no number to call for ?s. Help

32855,34936,Special shout out to the Newark baggage services office at @VirginAmerica. Nick went above &amp; beyond tracking down my lost Kindle! The best.
32863,34944,Headed home from LA. Can't wait to get home. Just Exhausted!!! @united http://t.co/YtQJR1F1yB

32929,35014,@VirginAmerica hi - trying to book flights but keep getting a 'whoa' error at the final stage - are there problems with the site?
32934,35020,@united  Your Houston to Tampa desk crew stinks. you lie about equipment failures to justify canceling flights.
32937,35023,@united I was more concerned with being 6 hrs late on 2 flights I drove 60 miles for so I could get a 'direct' flight
32939,35025,@united hi JP. I wasn't told to file a claim only to just wait and see if it shows up while I'm travelling..how do I go about doing this?
32940,35026,#UCCan benefit plans members: give us your email &amp; never miss updates on pay/pension/benefits! MinistryandEmployment@united-church.ca

32966,35055,@AmericanAir trying to book a one-way flight to Chicago &amp; your offerings are insane. It's cheaper to book a flight to Minneapolis_
32967,35056,More bad news for @AmericanAir as pilots have negative reaction to contract. Read more: http://t.co/4nvncBgkd6
32970,35060,HOLY SHIT @united I have no idea how you broke a door. sent us to a gate that has no body working at. so now we have to wait even longer
32994,35086,@united likely will miss my connection to RDU. Any alternatives?
32998,35091,@SouthwestAir two thumbs down.
33006,35100,@DeltaAssist We never received a receipt for a flight we purchased from you guys. Need it for official government reports.

33043,35139,Trying to remember the last time I took a @united flight put of SFO that wasn't delayed. Drawing a blank
33046,35142,Any goodwill @united created w/ that upgrade from San Diego to SF has evaporated after 3 hours stuck back by the bathrooms SF-&gt;Chicago 
33055,35151,Glad to see @AmericanAir listened to complaints about discontinuing meals on some first class and made changes.  Plus upgrade to lite meals.
33056,35152,@deltaassist If you have a responsive site. then I don't have to search for a teeny tiny link that I didn't see. #fail

33110,35209,To my horror @SouthwestAir left my cousin standing at the terminal door as the pilot &amp; plane decided to wait.
33112,35211,That awkward moment when your flights delayed because the slide popped out @SouthwestAir
33119,35218,Stuck on a plane in Chicago because @united doesn't have a backup plan for a pilots iPad not working
33121,35221,@AmericanAir waiting at SHV with no crew or plane. just lots of confused passengers.

33172,35279,@JetBlue trying to book flights online but keep getting stuck at credit card approval. Is the VISA system down?
33175,35282,Not sure why @alaskaair has been boarding 50 min before takeoff recently. Nice to be ontime but 35 min wait for doors to shut is lame.
33176,35283,Bad: Stuck in coach LAS-SEA Good: @AlaskaAir serves banh mi sandwiches N &amp; W bound on flights &gt; 2 1/2 hours. Bad: My flight is 2 hrs 20 min

33827,35960,@AlaskaAir sad that I check in early and your agent tells me that I have to wait an hour.or check my bag at the curb for a fee #servicefail
33839,35972,"The only thing with directions in it's name that's worse than @SouthwestAir is the movie ""North"". But it's real close."
33846,35981,Sad sign :( @SouthwestAir http://t.co/D9TaWW5Dgb
33875,36013,Commercial for @SouthwestAir and watching/streaming NFL football. Any normal traveler knows this is IMPOSSIBLE with their bandwidth. #lies

33957,36097,@AmericanAir your 767's are bad...
33970,36112,"@united UA48 two hours delayed and no end in sight. Best thing the crew says is to ""relax"""

33977,36120,@DeltaAssist: was to be on DL.3651 1st class:you missed my connection : in the last row of 6276. I want my money back
33991,36134,Hey @SouthwestAir please cancel my boyfriend's flight. I don't want him to leave. 
34003,36147,Mother. Fuckers. @United left my luggage in Houston. Now they tell me it's too late to get an updated status. so I'll have to wait until tmr
34011,36155,@AlaskaAir Thanks for the info. Got through with no problem.
34019,36163,Yes. we should Leave @United http://t.co/sMdCkm4P99
34025,36169,@united I'm going to miss class because of my delayed flight _
34028,36172,@JetBlue I figured it was worth a shot! Good free publicity never hurt an amazing low cost carrier right ??
34029,36173,@VirginAmerica aww man. I left my iPhone charger on the plane.... There isn't such thing as a lost a found somewhere is there?
34037,36183,I really hope @AmericanAir baggage crew doesn't steal my wallet I mistakenly left in my bag which is now lost in transit &amp; arrives tomorrow.
34038,36184,Congrats @JetBlue 8 daily mint A321 between LAX and JFK effective May 1 2015! Can't wait to see which city will get minted soon!
34040,36187,@AmericanAir is there an actual email address I can use? the form's 1500 characters are not enough to explain the whole issue.
34042,36189,@AmericanAir I've just discovered my bag has been damaged :-( How can I report this?
34048,36196,@united lies lies lies
34049,36197,@DeltaAssist on our honeymoon about to take off from Boston.  Hopefully you guys don't leave without us to st Thomas from JFK!  gcpca8
34050,36198,Makes you wonder why you have to give # for emergency alerts when @jetblue doesn't even text to say flight is cancelled last minute.
34053,36201,@DeltaAssist c'mon. Delta. Enough with the technical issues on flight 786. Can't these pre-checks be performed earlier to prevent delays??
34055,36203,Rain AND traffic? Yep pretty sure I'm going to miss my 7:30am @VirginAmerica flight to SFO. #anxiety
34060,36208,@JetBlue #jfkairport tough weekend. 1 of the most frustrating. Glad to go home. Lost a lot in #WHERESMYBAG no faith in U finding it. #tired
34061,36209,@DeltaAssist pathetic speed of de-icing at SDF this morning for DL2099.  Been more than 40min and still going.  You can do better!
34063,36211,Oh @AmericanAir I miss my legroom -#cheatingonu #cheaperisnotbettrr #ididntbuyit http://t.co/VbgEqz4Dpx
34075,36224,@AmericanAir ..plane stuck on the ground? Didn't we know the plane was scheduled to leave at 650am!!! No other airlines seem to have issues!
34079,36228,@DeltaAssist I would like to make a complaint about a flight. I'm based in the UK. can you give me a direct email address to contact please?
34082,36231,@AmericanAir Flt 2401 on new A321S. Ovens not working in FC galley so it's a cold breakfast. Did Airbus give discount for defective ovens?
34087,36236,@DeltaAssist  2nd plane. 2nd day in a row for maintenance issues. Next trip I'll be flying your competitors. #Delta is not trustworthy.
34090,36239,"Proof. More waiting today for ""those with disabilities. that need extra time. or veterans."" @JetBlue #principles http://t.co/mXd1uSDw2I"
34093,36242,@AmericanAir Im on a stalled out CTA train heading to O'hare. Major delays. Myself and many travelers are going to miss flights. Plz avise?
34094,36243,@SouthwestAir still getting Oops! password.requiredRules on a-list preferred login screen. IPhone/iPad issue?
34096,36245,@united unfortunately I didn't make my trip to EZE. However. Romona N at gate C42 stayed late to make sure we all found a way home or out.
34098,36247,@united why did you cancel my flight #UA4175 out of AVL out of no where?????
34112,36261,@united piss poor job handling massive plane cancellations yesterday not related to weather. This was the line. http://t.co/pzGd7d3lT3
34113,36262,Friends - @united sucks for bikes. I recommend saving a $100 receipt in bag. Produce it when they try to stick it to you. Works every time.
34115,36264,@DeltaAssist I'm in the air from Detroit.  Late flight to ATL going at STT. Leaves at 9:41 am.Will they wait for us. It's only flight today
34119,36268,"Why I left @united: ""the ritualized abuse that we've become accustomed to is a sad indictmentofour civilization."" http://t.co/t9tGfbOYWW"
34131,36281,@americanair this is even more annoying; from 972-425-2470 to http://t.co/eLUZm8JdTu -&gt; a # in DWF and back to 972-425-2470 to file claim
34132,36282,#UCCan benefit plans members: give us your email &amp; never miss updates on pay/pension/benefits! MinistryandEmployment@united-church.ca
34135,36285,@AmericanAir what are our options?  Can we change to an earlier flight than 645pm without cost if available or are we stuck?
34139,36289,Two for two late leaving Chicago for Brussels on @united due to a mechanical. Old planes are balling up my travel schedule. #GrumpyMonday
34141,36291,@VirginAmerica it's no problem! It's my fault I didn't check the seat before I left! Thanks va! And I bought some va stock! #bestairlineever
34147,36297,@united Not the delay that was the problem. it's winter travel from ORD. problem was no ground crew in CMH. 25 minute wait on Tarmac.
34150,36302,@DeltaAssist delayed b/c you swamped a plane. now long layover and you can't compensate with Delta Sky Club pass?
34153,36305,@united why do you move my seats without notice?  I hate when you do this. Not the first time. Is this how you treat your #FF ???
34155,36307,Is it sad that I just squealed with excitement after getting my status back on @AmericanAir? #corporateproblems
34158,36310,I broke up with @united http://t.co/WzJgAdDO99 http://t.co/dHwdrFfo2I
34170,36322,@DeltaAssist unfortunately we never registered for Miles when using you guys from Ireland to Las Vegas the past few years. Only did today
34176,36328,@SouthwestAir havent u noticed everyone tweets u bad things?
34182,36334,@AlaskaAir gotta say I'm disappointed. At the gate for last call &amp; they wouldn't let us board #lax. Didn't even call our names. #aafail
34183,36335,@AlaskaAir thank you for the new covered walk way from the gates to the planes. No more bad hair days after commuting from SEA to PDX.
34187,36339,Thank you @VirginAmerica for the future travel credit.  Please enact a bereavement policy that limits suffering while people mourn.
34190,36342,@AmericanAir - It seems to be prohibitively expensive to travel this December ; especially prices after 13th Dec - rip off !!!  #staycation
34196,36349,@SouthwestAir why would they miss her on the plane? Don't they do head counts?
34198,36351,@AmericanAir please I need an email address of yours in USA to complain about a delayed baggage
34205,36358,on a super turbulent flt being tossed from side to side. Help! @JetBlue - I love you but I can't wait to get out of this tin can!
34208,36363,@DeltaAssist FYI. Someone needs to tell maintenance at LGA terminal D that it's hotter than heck in here!  People are fanning themselves
34215,36370,@united The damaged baggage page says you're not responsible for the feet of my suitcase. and that's what was damaged.
34216,36371,If my bag doesn't make it to OKC. I'm gonna be fuming mad. #united blues. I miss @SouthwestAir
34223,36379,Our flight is 3.5 hours delayed and @VirginAmerica played a game of who had the oldest penny for a free drink or movie.  Really?!
34231,36387,@SouthwestAir Im sick and tired of waiting around
34234,36390,@SouthwestAir this week I'll be flying my last two flights to get to A list status. I can't wait! You are by far the best airline out there!
34249,36406,@AmericanAir second time this year getting downgraded. This time due to two broken oxygen masks in first class. #757 #Boeing
34252,36409,Helluva day to try and travel @AmericanAir !  Finally got on plane now been waiting to de ice for over an hour.  #travel #snow
34257,36415,The screen at my seat on @AmericanAir has flashed this once a second. Flight crew can't stop it. I may go insane. http://t.co/27FkFfxJKb
34263,36421,@united we need to reach our destination because the flight delay we have to wait another day and do not support with costs
34283,36442,.@VirginAmerica RULES THE Skies!! at least for domestic flights. one problem! why can't you be in more airports flying more cities!!!!!!
34294,36454,@SouthwestAir I used your airlines for a vacation and missed my connecting flight and all you can give me is $200 in vouchers?
34300,36460,Day two of lost luggage. Maybe today @AlaskaAir can find time to get me my bags. That would rock.
34311,36471,@AmericanAir   how is it that you change from a S80 to 738 and you move platinum passengers from row 8 to row 19??  #badbusiness
34312,36472,@AmericanAir. is there is any chance you could hold flight 3649 to FAR at O'Hare for a minute what with how it's your fault we might miss it
34315,36476,Love @JetBlue's new LAX to JFK planes w/ wifi. Thanks to Alia. awesome FA. for letting me switch seats to get my own row for a good nap!
34326,36488,@DeltaAssist  1176 gonna go?  Weather looks bad and new plane coming per gate.
34328,36490,why is it that everytime I fly from New York my flight gets delayed? @JetBlue
34330,36492,@AmericanAir The bad service as only you can do it so frequently!. Really next time I will choose any other airline but yours.
34333,36495,"Lol. is it sad that I saw @VirginAmerica A320 with sharklets and knew it was ""Jersey Girl"" before even looking at the name?"
34334,36496,Hey .@United I know you wanted to see my tweets but I seemed to have lost your Follow.
34337,36499,DaneCook: Hey .@United I know you wanted to see my tweets but I seemed to have lost your Follow. http://t.co/ZTfU6YGlhH
34347,36509,@United  any insight into the reason flight 4134 has rescue vehicles waiting for it Houston?  Nothing seemed wrong during flight.
34358,36520,@JetBlue please just admit flight 598 is delayed.  Much more fun things to do at Seatac than wait at the gate.
34364,36526,@AmericanAir can't switch gates?
34374,36539,Are you having website issues @AmericanAir? I keep getting an error page when trying to search for flights.
34375,36540,been an advocate of @VirginAmerica for years. BUT hugely disappointed with my last two flights.
34382,36547,And the award for most stressful round trip air travel goes to... Duh. @united.
34384,36550,@americanair why is always when I travel u have so many issues fl#1073 Mia to PHL will miss connection

34392,36558,. @JetBlue crew handling this weather-induced delay as professionally and politely as possible. This is why they are my favorite airline.
34394,36560,Thought I'd give @AmericanAir a chance. Bad decision. Every time I think it can't get worse. they find a way to fulfill that disappointment.
34404,36571,Had to fly American due to geography...oh. how I miss Delta @DeltaAssist!!!!
34406,36573,@AmericanAir please train your folks on the art of problem solving and critical thinking
34408,36575,I hate to be a complainer but a main reason for flying @JetBlue is TV entertainment for an 8YO.  No TV service flying FLL to BOS today.  :(
34411,36578,@VirginAmerica fix #TheLoft LAX! Its like a club in daylight. Populated by a sad looking cheese plate and douchebags that need to go home.
34412,36579,"Definitely not traveling with @SouthwestAir anymore. ""Sorry we cancelled your flight and will not extend your travel funds."""
34413,36580,We missed our landing coming from SFO to LAX @VirginAmerica heart is beating fast after pilot announced equipment problems
34426,36593,@AmericanAir under seat space on aisle seat on new 737 awful. I miss the MD 80! And I have almost 2 mill miles!
34431,36598,OK @United #1073 - 30 mins and we have not pushed back... scheduling problems?
34432,36599,Waited too long to decide to do a paid upgrade on @united 1285 tomorrow hoping for a CPU. No such luck and the cabin is booked now :(
34453,36623,38th on @united's upgrade list! Looks like I'll just miss forfeiting my middle seat in economy. #membershipmatters
34454,36624,Oh. @AmericanAir. Bumped me from my ticketed flight for time. When I made it. I had to wait standby on my original fare. We should chat.
34473,36645,One of 40 on a 737?? Best flight.  Heck yea all the legroom.  Heck yea @SouthwestAir!! http://t.co/s4ayuF1v7G
34479,36651,Is it me or have @SouthwestAir board times gotten longer?
34480,36653,@DeltaAssist PNR GYRXSR can you confirm me on 5982 tomorrow? 6371's been late 2 days in a row. tight connection at DTW that I'd miss.
34482,36655,@VirginAmerica flew on your plane yesterday. Our seats were busted and would not recline. That sucked. Please fix before return flight.
34483,36656,Not super happy with @AlaskaAir today... Both flights delayed by more than 45 minutes!!!! Never used to have so many delays!
34487,36661,@DeltaAssist: Y'all missed it today. Charged me $200 to take an earlier flight that was delayed and possible to make the last connection.
34488,36662,@AmericanAir way to screw me over for the second week in a row! Never again
34502,36676,@DeltaAssist just landed from ORD. Is DL 468 to tlv delayed? Must be in israel tomorrow!
34503,36677,@DeltaAssist I will believe it when I see it. Not the first time I've had this problem.
34504,36678,Cookie bar. watching #MNF #stillers in an armchair. I can think of worse ways to spend a delay (at @United Club) https://t.co/gHUzkLY0en
34507,36681,@AmericanAir My #Mother broke her shoulder today and I was to return tomorrow. you want to charge me $396 more to change to a later date!
34509,36684,I generally like @SouthwestAir but lately all my flights have been delayed !
34512,36687,Mechanical failures and 7 hours at RSW did this to my 2 boys.  @SouthwestAir How about a Movember donation? http://t.co/jRRSdsciTr
34522,36697,@AmericanAir - waiting in the holding area at ORD for &gt; 15 min - after a nearly 2 hour delay at MCO.  No end in sight :(.

34561,36738,Shout out to @SouthwestAir for beautifully handling a nearly 4 hour mechanical delay. Vouchers for everyone + lots of Luv.
34567,36744,@SouthwestAir Plane had a mechanical and we had to wait hours for another today. You guys gave everyone a $200 voucher. Thanks.#classy
34585,36764,"@DeltaAssist If a traveler's name is legally ""Emily"" but it's spelled ""Emilie"" on the ticket. will we run into problems?"
34594,36773,@AmericanAir whatever. I don't want to argue. But why does ticketing leave at 10 PM? There should be a plan if there are mass cancellations.
34595,36774,Im considering taking a trip just so I can reach the next level of @uniteds frequent flier program. And Im so not ashamed. #travelperks
34598,36777,@DeltaAssist any chance i can use miles to upgrade my MSP-SJC flight tomorrow? I have a horrible seat.
34600,36779,@AlaskaAir we got 1 passenger to switch ourselves. still not all together. 3hr delay. thanks for PR tweet!
34603,36782,Shoutout to the gate agent on my @United flight at DIA tonight- her friendliness made my bad night a little better! 
34608,36787,@united yes. Barely. Send me chipotle vouchers for my inconvenience
34619,36798,@JetBlue Houston Hobby. I live 90 minutes away will not drive back. I fly at least 4 times per year and it will no longer be with JetBlue.

34656,36836,@SouthwestAir Give me an earlier non-stop to Chicago so I can kick AA to the curb!!!!  7 am doesn't get me to the office until after 10.
34664,36845,@JetBlue What is happening with Flight 40 today?? I'm stuck in Colombia &amp; can't find any details
34668,36849,@JetBlue stop tempting me with your living social deals and promo codesssss. it's torture
34669,36850,Dear @JetBlue: Bring back SYR- FLL non-stop. #AllegientAir is offering starting Feb. I would have to switch for non-stop convenience. Nooo!
34671,36852,@AmericanAir you may be worse than delta
34675,36856,@united Do you guys have some type of bet going to see how bad your service can be before you fail completely?   http://t.co/SGYjKktizh

34687,36870,@JetBlue I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HANGING OUT WITH YOU TODAY I'M SORRY I CHEATED ON YOU forgive me pls _
34688,36871,Got stuck on a legacy carrier today and for two flights was reminded why I fly @SouthwestAir !!!
34689,36872,Best part about being 5 mins away from taking off for the past 45 mins is the seated stress position this @AmericanAir chair has me in.
34696,36879,hey @united . . . hate to be a bother. but would it be a terrible inconvenience to call when you cancel a flight??
34699,36882,I so badly want @SouthwestAir to have a direct flight from PIT to LGA. or any in the NYC area. Not a fan of having to fly other airlines.
34703,36886,@DeltaAssist I think it is time for you to update the entertainment systems.  The video tape never seem to work on the sna 757-loyal diamond
34704,36887,The @VirginAmerica safety video song has been looping in my head for 2 full days. I will never forget how to evacuate a plane.
34707,36890,@AlaskaAir No problem! Took four flights recently. crew and planes were all great. Love the new seatbacks. USB ports.
34709,36892,@AlaskaAir:Flight 405 delayed from SJC to Portland by 1.5 hours. Missed the meeting. My trip is now virtually useless #miffed #NeverAgain
34711,36894,@SouthwestAir scheduled to fly from Ontario to Oakland 8:00 am today and my flight is cancelled AGAIN. Fourth time this year!!
34714,36897,@JetBlue Thank you so much! Looks like I will have to wait as I do not plan to travel until valentines Day!
34725,36909,Hey @JetBlue. feel free to cancel my flight tomorrow. I ain't trying to go back to work this week anyways.
34727,36911,The new @VirginAmerica flight safety video is stuck in my head. #dontactuallymind
34736,36920,@JetBlue I got a message from the lost and found team at BOS that my kindle was found! Thank you JetBlue for great service!
34741,36925,Ironically @United Airlines loyalty program is pushing us away. 5 calls later &amp; still missing 10.000 rewards points. Should it be this hard?
34745,36929,"@VirginAmerica Knows how to prevent me from listening to the preflight safety briefing: turn it into a long ""rap"" song.  So irritating."
34750,36934,@JetBlue wanted to thank Malik. the jetblue supervisor at RDC for fedexing my lost kindle!
34752,36936,@JetBlue it'll be my first time flying mint on the 30th... Can't wait! :)
34757,36942,@DeltaAssist another passenger just dropped her laptop on my husbands arm. Not sure if broken. Recourse?
34760,36945,@SouthwestAir trying to call and getting a message that your number is out of service. Is there another number I can try?
34765,36950,Thanks for leaving me &amp; my husband stranded in Vegas on his birthday @VirginAmerica. Zero compassion or customer service? #unexpected #sad
34766,36951,@united About ANA? Their seats in biz are smaller. less private. fewer adjustments. not flat. bad power location. Yours better in all these!
34768,36953,Flying @VirginAmerica never gets old. Best player in the game by far.

35520,37769,Hey @JetBlue I used 2 like u guys. but liek u a little less now &amp; will outright HATE u if you add bag fees. See link &gt;http://t.co/UPdx7iexFA
35521,37771,Oh @JetBlue. say it isn't so! And then they were all the same. Too bad.
35527,37780,Somehow @SouthwestAir lost my checked bag. then they miraculously found it the last day before I had to make a claim. Even better was when..
35528,37781," nooooooo @JetBlue say it ain't so!! Leave those 15 seats off the Airbus and keep the ""no fee"" baggage. That is exactly separated you"
35534,37790,@JetBlue just lost me as a customer. You took away free checked bags and legroom #ultimatebetrayal
35535,37791,oh. @JetBlue I guess it was bound to happen. but I have to admit I'm a little disappointed in my fave airline. #baggagefees #lesslegroom
35539,37795,What happened. JetBlue? You were supposed to be the one.   It's a sad day: @JetBlue cuts leg room. adds bag fees http://t.co/bbZSKzTtIP
35542,37798,#Customerexperience not impt 2 US air industry. @JetBlue reduces legroom. + prices. Consumers suffer w/ few choices. http://t.co/Zu2noeWNI8
35544,37800,With fuel prices plummeting. what choice did @JetBlue have but to add bag fees? http://t.co/qj6QKVRCYe Wait a minute http://t.co/ZeSStX9iBr
35546,37802,"Oh @JetBlue today is a sad day for B6 loyalists. I know you're touting your new ""options"" but your service/no bag fees ARE what make u great"
35547,37804,Got around to checking the news. Well. @JetBlue. I guess I'm never getting on an airplane again because you were the only non-suck airline.
35549,37808,There's a Wilhelm Scream in @United's safety video.
35553,37813,@JetBlue disappointed in jet blue today... Now you're just another airline
35555,37815,@JetBlue more like JetBooooooooooo do you FEE-L me? #disappointed http://t.co/8Iz0THLraD
35559,37819,Seriously @AlaskaAir ? 3 different delays? I will let you tell my godson why I'm missing his bday party tonight. #MVP http://t.co/xURQ05EEhS
35561,37822,@JetBlue So sad to hear you're changing everything that makes you amazing!
35562,37823,@jetblue buy back shares and go private. You're about to ruin what made you great. Fly you exclusively. But now I wonder...
35564,37825,This is so horrible. @JetBlue please change your minds. We want you to be different. #JetBlue #BagsFlyFree http://t.co/SEojL77R7P
35565,37826,Too bad @JetBlue is more focus on their shareholders rather than its passengers. http://t.co/u2bpMuwEHp
35567,37828,@JetBlue I will no longer fly JetBlue. You were the only airline that had a soul. Margins may increase. but revenue will fall with no flyers
35575,37837,@JetBlue....As a loyal customer. this news sucks.  http://t.co/cnvoiRUenv
35582,37844,What the hell @JetBlue?! #NotHappy http://t.co/MWvFDT21DR
35583,37845,@jetblue #jetblue becoming another ripoff airline!!!   JetBlue Cuts Leg Room. Adds Bag Fees http://t.co/DTx6bkGNzB
35588,37854,Very disappointed in @JetBlue s news today. Less legroom and baggage fees? These eliminate the reasons why I like that airline so much.
35591,37858,@JetBlue worse decision you guys made was to charge for bags. My loyalty heavily depends on that
35595,37862,Breaking News:   @JetBlue is now just another crappy airline.  RIP
35597,37864,"Credit to @JetBlue for announcing its ""bad"" news today. rather than on a Friday. which is all too often used to dump bad news. #JetBlue"
35598,37866,.@JetBlue is only airline I fly domestically. Sad 2see they're removing customer service features that set them apart http://t.co/pYx4XxoPrI
35601,37870,disappointed to hear that @jetblue is reducing the amount of legroom available in coach. it's the primary reason i fly them exclusively.
35605,37874,Aww @jetblue__ How could you??? So much for you being the only airline to believe that flying doesn__t have to suck. http://t.co/wTca0LpAu2
35607,37876,@JetBlue WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?! http://t.co/9MZp0tthB2 I literally fly with you guys for the things you are about to cancel. #DumbMove
35608,37877,@Jetblue introduces baggage fees. reduces legroom - too bad. was one of my favorite companies http://t.co/GLcHWRavHH
35611,37880,@united no time to repair the club. Gotta fly!
35617,37886,So disappointed in @JetBlue__s coming changes. #Conformity
35620,37889,Flying to Chicago on @JetBlue tomorrow ... Might be my last time with the awful announcements made today #loyalcustomer #youweremynumberone
35621,37893,@JetBlue shame on you! You used to be a good deal but the future of jet blue friendly skies are coming to a quick end http://t.co/okaqzBOcT9
35630,37903,We are 45 min late AND our gate is occupied.  Imagine if we were on time.  Bad showing today @AmericanAir

35647,37923,@SouthwestAir I'm getting email messages for someone else's flight. I hope they don't miss out!
35648,37924,@JetBlue sad to see your announcement about space and bag fees earlier today. Guess southwest will get my business now. #youusedtobespecial
35655,37931,@SouthwestAir any specials for the Thanksgiving holidays for a broke college student ?
35660,37937,@JetBlue no kiosks at DCA. or did I miss them?
35662,37939,@SouthwestAir my poussey smell like 1000 rotting fish so nobody want to sit next to me on plane :( I always so alone without assigned seat!!
35663,37940,JetBlue Is Going To Destroy What Makes @JetBlue Great http://t.co/NWFueSHqI1 - oh the humanity! so much for bringing it back! #custexp
35670,37948,Super disappointed in @JetBlue... who else does non-stop flights from MCO to BOG?
35672,37951,Can't say the same for @AmericanAir #horribleservice #nothappy #neverflyingthemagain #twodown
35673,37952,@JetBlue baggage cost bad enough. decreasing legroom?! No longer flying with you. #morelegroom
35674,37953,@JetBlue way to go. making yourself just like every other crappy airline out there. #luggagefee #tiny #seats
35675,37954,Hate to hear about Delta's Airbus order. Only drives my love for @AlaskaAir even more #Seattle #HometownAirline #IfItAintBoeingIAintGoing
35680,37960,@JetBlue  Very unhappy with the news today. Been loyal to #JetBlue for many years. now I need to find a new airline
35684,37964,@JetBlue sorry to hear about the changes. It all comes down to $. you still might be better than the others but not as good as you were #sad
35685,37966,Bad move today @JetBlue  #losingyouredge
35688,37969,@DeltaAssist please staff accordingly so we do not need to wait 20 minutes for a crew to bring us to the gate. #louisville
35690,37971,"@JetBlue thanks for decreasing legroom.  As a 6'4"" person. I will miss flying JB.  You used to be a cool airline."
35691,37972,So since I'm trapped on your plane and nobody will tell me.  What time do i get to my destination @AmericanAir
35699,37980,"@AmericanAir ""MADURO"" UBIKATE OK. SOLO *DIOS* POR ENCIMA DE MI (HONOR) NO TU.NI PRJIMO (ESTIRPE RUIN NADIES) LEE AKI http://t.co/44EZEbc0rC"
35703,37984,@JetBlue you just lost my business. it's a shame you used to better than everyone else!
35704,37985,Thank you @JetBlue for making air travel even more miserable -- and all the more reason to drive instead! #SheBuysCars #TMOM
35712,37994,.@JetBlue enhancing revenue by making flights more cramped &amp; expensive - I'll def look at other airlines the next time I book a flight
35714,37997,Come on @JetBlue. don't be like the rest of them. So disappointed about the bag charges and disappearing leg room. 
35717,38000,Wait. @JetBlue to charge bag fees + reduce leg room?
35725,38009,@SouthwestAir why are your flights out of Midway always delayed!!!
35726,38011,Hey. @JetBlue. not so happy about this news: http://t.co/tG8rHuCZln
35727,38012,@united Question: if my name is wrong when I go to check in for flight. will that pose problems when boarding/at security? How to fix this?
35728,38013,Corporations aren't driven by money and greed. They strike the perfect balance of caring for customers and shareholders. Oh. wait. @JetBlue
35730,38015,FYI if you have a parrot don't fly with @AmericanAir they won't let you take pets that aren't dogs/cats and I had to cancel my reservation
35743,38031,@JetBlue Too bad. I always flew JB. Not happy about less legroom &amp; bag fees. U claim to be better than others but are like the rest. #shame
35746,38034,So @JetBlue is now on their PR spin. Super annoyed. They used to be my airline of choice. Now they start charging for every little thing
35747,38035,@jetblue yeah. cave to investors like everyone else in the crappy airline business while reporting record profits. Way to go! Nice email.
35750,38038,Losing 1-2 inches of leg room sucks. but gaining an outlet to charge my devices is amazing. Also. who checks bags??? @JetBlue
35751,38039,@united I'm curious to know if exit row briefings are no longer standard operating procedures on flights? They certainly weren't today.
35759,38048,@JetBlue please. please don't fall into the airline profit squeezing mess many of the others have. http://t.co/7BkEz1n1fX
35760,38049,@JetBlue Good bye Chicago heading back home #NY #JetBlue flight # 1106 looking forward can't wait to board
35762,38051,@AmericanAir I have a flight on hold. is there a way to see how many miles the trip will be?
35768,38060,I'm kind of heartbroken about @JetBlue announcement that they're going to make their brand as crappy as every other airline.
35770,38062,@JetBlue .... Not good.  #corporatesellout
35773,38065,@JetBlue I'm sad about carry on fee babe
35782,38074,The airline you fell in love with is following the playbook of airlines that everyone hates. Bummer. @jetblue http://t.co/2SH0cCn70z
35785,38077,@SouthwestAir policy on switching flights?
35787,38079,Flew @JetBlue for the 1st time over the weekend &amp; they're pretty great. considering I hate to fly. The TV really helped distract me.
35788,38080,@JetBlue Are you going to lower fares since you're charging for bags? Not happy. Always flew Jet Blue. looks like Southwest it'll be...
35789,38081,Ugh. @JetBlue. don't do this to me - concerned True Blue AMEX member and frequent flyer.
35793,38087,@JetBlue what a shame - reducing legroom. Now you have no differentiation from other airlines. Used to pay more to fly with you. no more now
35795,38089,Looks like @JetBlue sold out. That's depressing. Now when my plane is delayed (which seems like all the time now) I won't be so forgiving.
35799,38093,Thx @AlaskaAir for worst day evr. Instead of flying SAN to STS. 7 hrs later I'm in PDX by way of OAK. Cant wait for 6am flight back to SAN.
35800,38094,@VirginAmerica no worries. Not your fault and I shouldnt really complain about the rain. We need it in CA!
35803,38097,@AmericanAir Sure wish you guys would get my sister to Little Rock from DFW after missing her flight..she flew from Australia..PLEASE!
35804,38098,I flew SWA&amp;jet blue this past wkend now I understand! Sardines vs best flight ever@JetBlue sad to hear of the changes#squished#flyinwillsuk

35817,38111,@united too late had to hump my laptop through EWR without all my proprietary work papers. After I PAID to check my roller board
35819,38113,Shout out to Geno. Bill n Will @AmericanAir lost n found #jfkairport #lostnfound!
35830,38125,Great service @VirginAmerica! Got us on an earlier flight than planned and had like zero wait time. TSA you still suck really really bad.
35831,38126,Hi @united any chance to make sure that I won't  be left behind like always on my last part of my trip? Stuck waiting for a gate at ORD.
35838,38133,Now @JetBlue is like every other crappy airline.
35842,38137,@SouthwestAir because you're crappy.
35843,38138,@JetBlue you lost a loyal customer today. I fly 4 times per year with you guys because of more legroom and no bag fee. adios!
35847,38142,why I hate @United. Late connecting flights...and boarded early so they can de-ice and on time. #CustomerLast http://t.co/RToPKsPHiu
35848,38143,@JetBlue question...my seat is in row 1 and I wanted to switch to row 5 do I have to pay again?
35850,38145,@JetBlue my flight on 12/16 will be the last. RIP #JetBlue you've lost a mosaic member- #delta also flies out of #Bermuda w/out layovers!
35870,38172,Missed my connecting flight from NY to Montreal @AmericanAir so I'll be the one walking around the terminal &amp; crying for the next 11 hours.
35874,38177,@DeltaAssist I've tried. but the process and identity access is irrational. they're my miles. but I can't use them!! #unfair
35876,38179,Boarding announced. then delay announced because inbound crew just left previous destination. Are you kidding me. @united?
35880,38183,@united why is UBER on the UA App for Iphone?  Considering the bad press they have gotten this is a bad partner!
35881,38186,In case anyone is wondering I hate @AmericanAir How do you run out of overhead bin space before the plane is half loaded?
35882,38187,@JetBlue what a disappointment :(
35884,38190,Very disappointed in @JetBlue. My go to airline. even when more expensive. Slowly becoming like the old timers. preference no more. Sad.
35901,38212,@JetBlue You used to be special and now? Just ordinary. Too bad. #byebyebluie
35903,38214,@JetBlue can blow me with their #bagfees. Hope you lose customers. You're losing this one #ripoff #greed #scumbags
35904,38215,Fuck you @JetBlue! I can't *wait* to pay for my baggage come 2015 when I go to St. Lucia on my #honeymoon #JetBlue
35906,38217,@SouthwestAir Had to web cncl 1st SW trip 2day yesterday. Cancel confirmed in my FF acct. Got noshow email &amp; lost my credit. #badexperience
35914,38225,@DeltaAssist just did. This is a MAJOR issue that may impact 1.000s of your customers. so I'm also following up via http://t.co/Id3F01Oeyh
35916,38227,@SouthwestAir Can't wait to fly with you guys to Chicago this weekend!
35918,38230,@jetblue charging for checked bags and reducing leg room in 2015 = no longer a special airline and now nothing more than more of the same
35924,38237,@united One of the wing walkers was late on our arrival . UA1156. 19Nov. Not long. but it's annoying.  Last time the jetway oper was late!
35926,38239,I no longer (heart) @JetBlue  Just became another airline. #DickMove
35931,38245,So sad to see that @jetblue is going to the dark side. I__ve often paid extra to fly them because it was a better experience :(
35936,38250,FX on the plane means I don't have to miss tonight's episode of AHS thank you @JetBlue #youremyfavorite
35947,38263,"Whoa. @JetBlue pretty lame if ask me. Once you added a ""first class"" I saw changes coming. but I never thought you'd go this route."
35953,38269,@united I hope this is the last time I fly with you. Return ticket changed. bag on wrong flight. and now a missed train. What next? Sigh...
35965,38282,Already got a metal splinter on this shiny new @united 787 from the tray table hinge ... Guess that's a problem with new planes? (Weird.)
35966,38283,@JetBlue had to cancel my flight because of #snowvember. talked with Karen on the phone. she took care of everything! You guys are awesome!!
35968,38285,@JetBlue thanks. no problem and as usual very exceptional customer service
35970,38289,@JetBlue thanks for tweet. As a customer I love your brand and service. just frustrated when investors miss the forest for the trees.

35978,38298,JetBlue cutting legroom. adding checked-bags fee for some fliers http://t.co/sKLr0pCxJv Bad move. @jetblue! #airlines #flights
35982,38302,@SouthwestAir BWI bags smell like crabs
35986,38306,@AmericanAir should look into hiring a nicer and more welcoming staff #poorservice

36002,38323,@JetBlue thanks for ruining my vacation.Buying my tix w/another airline after learning the customer comes last.#jetBOO!
36005,38326,Well. I hope you guys fail now @JetBlue. We certainly don't need a flying Walmart.
36007,38328,Damn. Used to swear by flying on @JetBlue. Shame they've damaged their brand to the point Im willing to look at alternatives now.
36017,38339,@DeltaAssist Never seen this before. Is there a problem? http://t.co/Hq6PeCu5c4
36020,38366,why does the best airline in the US @VirginAmerica have the worst mobile presence? no app and poor web interaction.
36031,38379,Shame on you @JetBlue - and we thought you were different... Just like the rest. No longer my airline of choice. http://t.co/lghgRtzqlb
36035,38385,oh. @JetBlue. Not a good move. Not at all. #byejetblue

36084,38442,@united Can someone please respond to my earlier tweets about a lost item? I have Elite status with you if that helps.
36095,38454,@JetBlue I'm sad to say that after these new changes go into effect it is over between us 
36099,38458,There's a reason @JetBlue can easily add a bag fee and squeeze legroom: Other airlines remain much worse. http://t.co/mQ9stYwgUN
36100,38459,What a huge disappointment about @JetBlue Leg room and first bag free were why I flew with them!!
36104,38465,@JetBlue Got a problem. Am with my autistic son. About to board flight 94. Received a Congratulations you've purchased extra room email.

36115,38478,My praise this week for @united may have jinxed me. When I changed flights. they cancelled my resv. I have no return from SFO tonight!!!
36126,38489,@JetBlue It's 2 bad u r following the big airlines w/ur new baggage policy. Despite falling gas prices. u find a way to $.05 &amp; $.10 us.
36127,38490,@JetBlue jumping ship like all the other airlines. A little disappointed! No need to book w/you all the time anymore. Just a regular airline
36140,38503,@JetBlue. you just broke my heart http://t.co/m2j7Ku5XYF
36143,38506,@SouthwestAir flight 1258 - Nashville. Trapped in plane. No updates being shared. #screwingupconnections #crewmakingjokes

36151,38514,@JetBlue was considering switching from Southwest. but with this news re: seats and baggage. I'll be staying with Southwest
36153,38518,@DeltaAssist hi. I'm missing the miles I flesh on Tuesday morning. Usually they're in my account the next day. I was on VS 26.

36159,38525,@JetBlue you lost a customer today. Your disregard to customers comfort was a deal killer
36170,38536,BOOO! THUMBS DOWN TO @JetBlue to add bag fees and extra seats to boost profit http://t.co/MMxEwqPwNZ this is bad move. No longer MY airline!
36171,38537,Is SAD to here @JetBlue is going to become the next Spirit Airlines (By far the Worst Airline) losing legroom &amp; adding a fee to check a bag
36174,38540,Marching to @JetBlue Now. FLL workers #theReadyJet8 demand lost wages from contractor who violated WorkerRetentionLaw http://t.co/M5NeMYNbBM
36175,38541,So @jetblue. airline I always preferred flying &amp; booked colleagues on it. is reducing legroom. Apparently wants to be another shit airline
36177,38543,@VirginAmerica it was not a problem. Great flight.
36181,38547,Bag fees and less leg room? Not good news from @JetBlue http://t.co/csYGkP7Mss
36184,38550,@SouthwestAir Anyway of checking if my bag made it onto my flight? It was a late check-in
36191,38557,@united hello homemade cookie lovers - what are my options to switch flights in order to get home earlier tomorrow?
36194,38560,@DeltaAssist Hi. I was given a Delta file number for this...15144209.  Please let me know if everything is OK. I can wait two weeks. but..
36203,38571,@JetBlue Extremely disappointed with yesterday's news. Just another airline now. Seriously reconsidering my preferred airline status
36207,38575,@AlaskaAir whats the best email to get help with an issue?
36210,38578,@AmericanAir my app will not let me log in - iphone 6+. I've deleted and redownloaded. Any suggestions or others with similar issues?
36215,38583,Frustrated with @SouthwestAir today. Can't extend my LUV voucher by ONE DAY? I want to fly with you. but where is the LUV?
36217,38585,Sorry @SouthwestAir you just lost our loyalty. Portion of unused funds? I'm going to use them to fly YOU! Not anymore. #justanotherairline
36224,38594,Not feeling thrilled about the @JetBlue changes coming about.  Will have to see how the pieces fall before I start shopping around. #sigh

36389,38770,Bad show @AlaskaAir. Poor line management and PA at SAT. MVPs never heard their call.
36395,38778,@JetBlue Better cancel those #FlyHuman pigeon ads once you pack in more seats and start ripping us off with bag fees.  #DontDoItJetBlue

36470,38856,@AmericanAir I was but others weren't. Definitely not a first time offense. Can't wait for platinum.
36474,38861,@AmericanAir. why the heck is there a $35 processing fee when I want to purchase $30 worth of mileage? #DumbLogic #FeesAbound
36484,38872,ANGRY re-CEO #RobinHayes aka 'Robbing Hates' decision to add bag fees &amp; cut space. Most loved @JetBlue to most hated? http://t.co/o4HbGlJNI9
36485,38873,@AmericanAir number 86 to London. Can we get meal service while we wait? I didn't have dinner. assuming we would be eating in air by now
36487,38875,Your airplane is here...we're just waiting for the crew... announces the staff to passengers at #SFO. Once again. I hate @SouthwestAir
36491,38879,@JetBlue say it isn't so..all the things that made you guys a cut above the rest going away. What a disappointment
36493,38882,@AmericanAir  Today I lost my flight in Calgary after an error at US customs. AA put me on a new plane tomorrow. No voucher. Stuck at YYC.
36495,38884,@JetBlue I will be extremely upset if you actually start charging baggage fees. I love Jetblue and have the American Express credit card.

36570,38960,I don't even know why I signed up for Click N Save on @SouthwestAir. They never have deals I can use.
36575,38966,Oh the anxiety of waiting to see if I'll qualify 4 @SouthwestAir A-list this year. #travelprobs
36579,38971,I fly @united nearly every week out of #LAX - the experience gets worse and worse with what Im suppose to accept as remodeling. meh-friendly

36645,39042,Somebody should tell @united this is never how you format a proper name. even in email. (My middle initial is E.) http://t.co/MqvtdOWn0N

36650,39048,@AlaskaAir yes but  it was too late. They already awarded first class to an 11-year-old kid who flies maybe twice a year.
36656,39054,@AlaskaAir Big #travelfail today all around. Bogus upgrade. ticket removed from reservation. no flight crew. continued flight delay.
36657,39055,It wasn't the captain's fault. it wasn't my fault. It was the asphalt. I love flying @JetBlue
36659,39057,Airline @JetBlue to add bag fees on cheap tickets. bad move obviously no longer cheap tickets. paying passengers lose out again. #ttot
36667,39066,@SouthwestAir Have been trying to cancel my flight via phone for days now. can't get through to a person. Online error keeps coming up.
36678,39077,@AmericanAir any chance you could not have us wait an hour on the runway in Detroit for the previous plane to move. There are other gates
36681,39080,@AlaskaAir thanks for getting me home safe and sound. even if I was stuck in the last row again.
36688,39087,@JetBlue sad that my personal tv doesn't work!  http://t.co/76bcpTtMjH
36694,39093,@AmericanAir you have officially made me mad. I will not be flying with you again.

36729,39130,I have always been an advocate of @JetBlue. but am very disappointed to see them becoming just like the others.  #unfortunate #allaboutmoney
36730,39131,@DeltaAssist now we're off the plane altogether. Not gonna make it back to Detroit from the terminal chairs. #ugh
36731,39132,Yep. @united is one of the worst airlines to fly if you're traveling with children. http://t.co/KOdizJ6oI6
36732,39133,@JetBlue Are you trying to compete to be one of the shittiest airlines? This is the best way to do it. #bagfees #lackoflegroom
36745,39147,Shoutout to @united for boarding us half way on the plane. then asking us to leave because there is no flight attendant.
36754,39159,S/O to @SouthwestAir for always being late  no.matter.what.
36757,39162,@JetBlue Its official you have completely lost the concept that you were founded on #bringinghumanitybacktoairtravel #justanotherairline now
36759,39164,next time you book with @JetBlue just be aware that your flight may or may not be cancelled. your vacation ruined. and that's ok w them.
36762,39167,@alaskaair did you switch to dial-up at the LAX Board Room? So slow it makes it impossible to get work done.
36763,39168,A million lifetime miles. Platinum Status &amp; I followed all procedures &amp; yet @AmericanAir just dropped the ball. A long day just got longer.
36774,39179,Spending lots of time (and $) with @AmericanAir through the end of the year. Can't wait! http://t.co/zBx6ztxUqY

36912,39326,What can @AmericanAir do to (1) placate the dozens of anxious. upset people on board &amp; (2) compensate those missing connecting flights?
36920,39334,@JetBlue terrible time with my trip. Long story which includes losing a day of vacation and wasting my time.  Wish I didn't pick JetBlue
36924,39338,@AmericanAir I'm getting more impressed. I've never been directly tweeted before by any business. Flight 232 from Atlanta to Dallas.
36931,39345,The best six hour commercial I've ever seen. Mad props @VirginAmerica. Have you been flying BLAH Airlines?:

36989,39409,I'd like to let the great folks at @JetBlue know that I'll never be taking their trash airline again
36990,39410,The jetway broke and can't deplane. Using manual stairs out the back. Guess we won't make connecting flights! @AlaskaAir
37009,39429,Wheels down 11:25. Still no bags at 12:03. @JetBlue.  Not good.

37029,39450,To say I'm upset is an understatement after how @united treated me today.
37033,39454,@united. Spend almost $5k for business class and when I check in. it's overbooked.  Switched me to Virgin without compensation.  #notright.
37034,39455,Oh my god this boarding process is taking forever. This is ridiculous. @DeltaAssist. Why are we all waiting for people to be upgraded?
37037,39458,continuing to book so many flights. and none on @united  ... i miss my loyalty but EWR is not a legit LAX - ATL transfer airport. sorry.
37038,39459,Taking charge of @AmericanAir AAL57 to Miami today. Waiting for my crew! :D
37042,39464,Not used to poor experiences with @united. Will be more wary when planning my business travel.

37064,39486,This @AmericanAir plane smells like pee... 
37068,39490,@AmericanAir Is there a number I can cal to talk to someone to change flights since I missed my first flight?
37074,39498,@jetblue For people who made reservations months ago for flights 2015 based on no baggage $ - are we grandfathered in? Sorry you did this.
37081,39505,always drama when you fly @JetBlue this company's poor performance continues to shock me #neveragain
37084,39509,@DeltaAssist I tried to cancel our reservation due to a major illness and now can't get confirmation of the cancel for insurance.

37096,39525,@AmericanAir disappoints once again. Missed connections. Missed interviews. Missed family time. And additional $ out of pocket. What a joke.
37097,39526,But God bless @united for not putting me on hold for a single minute. You guys deserve an award.
37116,39545,I hate @AmericanAir you always find a way to disappoint me _
37127,39557,Can't wait to de board this @JetBlue flight to contact customer service about my negative interaction with their associate.
37134,39566,@JetBlue Unfortunately. I experienced great service in regards to a last min cancellation &amp; still lost a lot of $. but you are great!
37135,39567,@united I know it's foggy here. but what's the difference between 3920 and 5240? They're in Chicago and I'm still waiting. #anythingyoucando
37136,39568,@SouthwestAir any reason online wifi was not working from phx to pit nov 19? #lostworkday
37143,39575,Calling to change a @united flight. Wait time is 20 minutes! TWENTY. Are you kidding? Hope the skies are friendlier than the call center
37154,39587,@DeltaAssist I was looking to cancel my flight. but wondering if my miles would be credited back.  Confirmation: H8DXBU. Manskar
37155,39589,The @VirginAmerica fun continues. Ours is the only row with broken TVs. This is going to go over well with my 3 yo_
37161,39595,.@JetBlue you guys are fucking sellouts. You will be bankrupt in a year. Flew you guys regularly. no more.
37169,39604,@AlaskaAir Your reducing leg room by 1.5 inches. Are you kidding me! As if seating is not cramped enough! Greed is a terrible thing.
37171,39606,@united 793 den-phx late. Instead of 11:47 am now 1:30 but inbound from ord shows den arr at 1:24. Not realistic is it?
37187,39622,@VirginAmerica Loved the pre flight games as we wait for weather to clear. Best socks.  oldest penny. oddest item in carry on. :)
37189,39624,Waiting at @AlaskaAir cargo for my dogs... http://t.co/MvMOTot7A7
37195,39630,@JetBlue Yes. there were options. but agents and supervisors wouldn't rebook. Still #unhappycustomer

37221,39656,Just dumped my @JetBlue stock. They just destroyed their niche and edge on the competition. Never downgrade your product or experience for $
37227,39662,Sigh.  @JetBlue joining the ranks of crappy. nickel and dime airlines. It was nice while it lasted. http://t.co/MT4Jyyv2UL
37231,39666,@DeltaAssist I got my bag from baggage claim to find all kinds of damage. Any reason for this? http://t.co/QyHZJTYZ6T
37245,39681,Why did @JetBlue promise our flight Guardians of the Galaxy and then give us The Fault in Our Stars? The entire plane is crying now.
37261,39697,@DeltaAssist trying to make a reservation. credit card authorization failed. Called bank. seems to be an issue on your end NEED to book ASAP
37265,39701,@DeltaAssist bought tickets via app this morning. Charged But no confirmation email reservation not showing in my trips &amp; we leave tomorrow

38210,40734,Looking forward to my flight today @JetBlue you never disappoint!! _
38216,40741,@SouthwestAir Issue a travel alert! #busiesttraveldayoftheyear
38217,40742,@DeltaAssist there was no one there. And it didn't give those guidelines in the Delta app. hence the tweet. Regardless. the bag is damaged.
38218,40743,@SouthwestAir i hate my cousin craig
38219,40744,Patiently waiting to board and immediately pass out #jetbluejfk @JetBlue #nosleep
38220,40745,@SouthwestAir any weather updates? We are flying mco to slc but have a short layover in bwi. and we are nervous about getting stuck there...
38225,40750,First time flying @VirginAmerica and there is a dog under my seat! I really loved it! Missing my kitty _

38263,40791,@JetBlue falling asleep on hold waiting on a manager #greatcustomerservice
38270,40799,@VirginAmerica we missed our flight out of JFK to LAX. Are we going to be able to make it home for thanksgiving w our dying granny?
38272,40801,@AlaskaAir My suitcase was delivered late last night. Thanks for fixing things as soon as possible :)
38273,40803,@DeltaAssist I don't need to rebook. I need off this plane. We're here late d/t mechanical failure
38275,40805,@AmericanAir sooooooo upset.
38289,40821,@AlaskaAir If you cancel flight. does same selling inventory need to be available for me to fly same day on diff flight? (Same travel class)
38298,40831,@AmericanAir Why wouldn't you catch a mechanical issue prior to leaving a gate? Sure. Taxi out. Taxi in. #getnewplanes #willmissconnection
38300,40833,@united my seattle &gt; Houston bag is lost #noupdate #needit #paidtocheckabagthatslost
38309,40842,It's a shame @virginamerica did NOT survey their loyal statused flyers re: direct flights from LAX to PHL b4 discontinuing the RTE.
38311,40844,Anyone traveling tomorrow in the NE or DC- @united - killed my change fees to let me get out today and avoid the storm.  FYI #thanksunited
38317,40850,@AmericanAir stuck at allamanda going to Chicago and hungry will you pay my food ? Fly 3111
38323,40856,Kudos to @DeltaAssist for solving the over billing issue!
38326,40859,@AmericanAir Don't just take my word for it. AA from best to last. It's truly a shame. Even Hawaii flights downgraded http://t.co/LB14WbxRZx
38329,40862,Grrr... @united flight change leaves 30 minutes earlier and gets in 40 minutes later. Not a deal breaker but 6 am flights suck. #travel
38334,40867,Way to go @AmericanAir. Load everyone on a plane and then realize it might be damaged. I just want to see my family!
38337,40870,____________________________________ wait for me @united
38341,40874,Millions of nice. kind people traveling today. Why do the mean ones stand out? Thankfully @JetBlue is killing it with kindness! #travel
38344,40877,@AmericanAir Any chance I can switch flights to an earlier flight this evening due to weather?
38351,40884,Just got a Thanksgiving sticker from @SouthwestAir FA because I agreed her hair was a mess when her coworker wouldn't http://t.co/dr5xM1edx1
38353,40886,@SouthwestAir A C16 boarding number after paying for EB check in?  Ridiculous. http://t.co/8bQb3Gbjmp
38354,40887,Ugh @JetBlue #KillingMeSmalls! Was told I was being put in #EvenMoreSpace #WindowSeat. 6F is NOT that._ http://t.co/JmJd00QvyN
38362,40896,I used to love @JetBlue. but no longer. They are adding fees and removing legroom. so they can raise profits http://t.co/rdGnITWKxd
38364,40898,@AmericanAir any news from LAX lost and found? Can we confirm if they have or not?
38366,40900,Ok. now we have a new @southwestair  confirmation # for the extra seat. Can't wait till return flite- I bet there'll be an issue...
38368,40902,.@DeltaAssist disappointed that reschedulin a flight to a few hrs earlier costs hundreds. Also the flight I'm trying 2 switch to is cheaper.
38375,40909,@DeltaAssist not yet waiting in line
38376,40910,@united I've flown almost exclusively with you for the last 10 years. but this past year you have lost some of my favor.
38377,40911,@united what are the odds that my flight (1674) from ORD to LGA at 6PM tomorrow will be cancelled? Should I change flights? #conflicted
38379,40913,Every singe time I fly @JetBlue there is a seating issue. Last time I lost my legroom this time a mother and son drama.
38382,40917,@united My best friend &amp; husband missed their flight today thinking their United flight was tomorrow. Can you please help?
38383,40918,There is a room for minors. and no children running around or screaming. GOD BLESS @AmericanAir in San Juan!!  #yesplease
38404,40940,@DeltaAssist I'm missing some MQS data for a round trip between ATL &amp; SJO taken January 2014
38406,40942,@SouthwestAir - Pulled from the runway as the captain out? 3rd crew - poor process.  Why would you put a second crew with a 30 min window?
38410,40946,@united Ty for refusing 2 rebook a teen flying alone bcause 2morrow's blizzard-bound east coast flights haven't been delayed yet #helpfulNOT
38412,40948,.@VirginAmerica : I miss the old cartoon safety video. Was calming. This new music video is cute for a minute. but just agitating by the end
38413,40949,I have to give a shout out to @united. I lost my iPad on a flight to NYC in JUNE. and they found it and returned it! Just got it by FedEx.
38421,40958,Please @united don't cancel my flight to the East Coast tonight!!

38502,41047,.@united is such a horseshit airline! I now hate flying with them. Sad to say I had a better experience on Delta. #travel
38510,41055,"Hate to be one of """"those people"""" but can't remember the last time I flew @SouthwestAir and my flight wasn't delayed!!!!!!!!!!! #southworst"
38511,41056,@JetBlue For 11/26/2014 flights to BOS. if I cancel tonight to due incoming N.E. weather will I get a refund to credit card or voucher?
38512,41057,@JetBlue dealing with lost luggage is a nightmare. Getting the run around. And now if I want it I have to go pick it up myself? Bullsh!t
38514,41059,I always hate flying @SouthwestAir
38519,41064,@VirginAmerica Virgin is great to fly but beware their customer service. SLOWWWWWW. Hope they repair the aircraft quicker.
38520,41066,@DeltaAssist how much will it cost to switch a round trip tckt from msp to Kenya? Departure: 12/25/2014. Want to return 01/8/15(From 01/24)
38522,41068,@SouthwestAir my sister is stuck in Indy! Her flight has been delayed 3 hours. I was planning on seeing her tonight but I guess not! Aha
38523,41069,.@united. you have discriminated against my best friend on flight 5001. Never flying you again.
38525,41071,@united Ive flown over 90k miles with str allnce so far this year. was informed I am still short of gold status for next yr. disappointed.
38527,41073,@AmericanAir Sent you a DM re: problem w/ a MAJOR schedule change that was foisted on us. Not ok w/ it. Are you able to assist via Twitter?
38528,41074,@JetBlue last time we flew I was delayed  Played trivia for coupons. Never got one even though I won. Now delayed in PITT. Time to shift?
38533,41079,@DeltaAssist  charging $800 after I had emergency surgery to switch flight 1 day. can't see family now for thanksgiving #profitoverpeople

38538,41084,@DeltaAssist if we receive text for delayed flights. we should receive text if departing earlier than announced also #poorcustomerservice
38544,41090,@DeltaAssist what is going on with the security sweep of 1860 in MIA? I have connections to AUS. will this delta mess up connection?
38556,41102,I haven't had a single flight leave on time in forever #stuckattheairport  @SouthwestAir
38557,41103,@JetBlue can you please tell me the reason of the delay of flight 1253 from FLL to SJU ?
38559,41105,Hey @united. flt 1494 is late out of Cincy to Hou. Make sure 1687 to San Diego knows passenger will be rushing over from comm terminal
38565,41111,looks like i might not be home for thanksgiving unless @united lets me reroute. DC weather looks bad for tomorrow. why not get ahead of it?
38566,41112,Hey @JetBlue Thanksgiving week is a bad time for your app to not work and not display my boarding pass. While in the gate. Just saying.
38572,41118,Water &amp; snacks during our short delay. Well done. @jetblue.
38576,41122,@united No warning and no reimbursement on missed flights #classicunited http://t.co/pb2WZrJdsd
38583,41130,@DeltaAssist I started a claim. but I can't exactly empty my bag and leave it with you while on a layover so you can try to repair it.
38593,41140,@united = Miserable.
38595,41142,@JetBlue is it normal practice for you guys to realize half an hour before an already delayed flight that you need to chane the whole crew?
38602,41150,My daily reminder not to fly @AmericanAir   #AmericanAirlinesSucks  #AmericanAirlinesStealsMoney

39881,42507,flew with @United Airlines for 16 hours yesterday on 3 legs. and they never once asked my 37wks pregnant wife if she was ok to fly. Strange.

39915,42543,Darn It @AlaskaAir you lost my bag. Oh well. I guess with as much as I fly with you it was inevitable.
39916,42544,@JetBlue to many issues.. Need to start affiliating with other airlines so I stop getting stuck everywhere I fly.
39920,42548,The friendly @JetBlue FAs on my last flight were amazing. They made a potentially awful flight comfortable and easy #ThanksGuys #101FLL2LAX
39923,42551,@AmericanAir The year is nearly over and I'd like to switch to #AA exclusively beginning 2015 if you can match my status from UAL. Yes/No?
39927,42555,@JetBlue flight diverted from SAN to LAX wouldn't have been too bad if you'd been honest about timing/showed passengers to buses. Great work
39928,42556,Finally home. 3.5 hours late. but still home. Kudos to @SouthwestAir for making a bad situation tolerable and getting us home tonight.
39935,42563,@JetBlue it would hate helped if your tech team updated the delays online first off

40042,42676,Come on. @AlaskaAir. we've been sitting on the Tarmac for 1hr. I know it's snowing &amp; thanksgiving. but you're my fav airline for a reason.
40044,42678,Oh. @United. no problem. it's probably our fault that you mishandled our gate check because you misread an old tag from another airline.
40046,42680,Shoutout to @AmericanAir and their archaic policies for making me stay even longer in this god forsaken airport
40059,42694,...security again. and to the opposite end of terminal A. TO TAKE MY TRANSFER FROM THE SAME FUCKING AIRLINE. FUCK YOU @AlaskaAir (2)
40063,42698,@DeltaAssist what need is some miles for being inconvenience. This is how Delta does million milers?
40073,42708,@AlaskaAir seatac is a mess. Lots of delays from the weather
40078,42713,@AmericanAir Hope you're sorry for the bait and switch too. Please answer the original question.
40087,42723,@SouthwestAir the link is broken.
40104,42742,@AlaskaAir would it be possible to switch to an earlier connecting flight from SEA-TAC to EWR?
40107,42745,Treated so rudely by @SouthwestAir emp for using the swa app boarding pass. Sorry it didn't scan immediately but it's not 'my phone's fault'
40114,42752,Over half the @united flights I take from Dulles to STL are delayed for some mechanical problem. Any chance y'all can get better planes?
40122,42761,Coming up on hour 7 waiting for this @JetBlue flight. So much coffee. So many snacks. losing mind. #twitter
40133,42772,@AlaskaAir - Flight crew did a great job in LAS turning the plane around and getting 617 on its way and updating on the tarmac in SEA.

40455,43111,@united put on my patience hat every time at IAH baggage claim. Last trip 45 min wait. let's see where we end up tonight?!
40456,43112,"I'm guessing it's bad when your @united gate agent says. ""have you checked Amtrak?"" In my 5 hr wait they've equipment problems 4 planes."
40462,43118,@United your boarding process is terrible. I upgraded my seat and I still board in the last group because I prefer an aisle seat?!

40468,43124,@SouthwestAir this is the 2nd time in 2 months that my fights have been delayed like this. I am not even flying to the east coast!!
40469,43125,@AlaskaAir Your people just took such good care of me. a sobbing mess going home to see my father for the last time. Thank you so much.
40476,43132,.@united. is there a reason you don't check to see if the engine will start BEFORE your pilots try to takeoff? #commonsense #badairline
40478,43134,@DeltaAssist why is a person with gold in EC and we have platinum and are cramped in non EC How does this work? We pay $7500 for status
40484,43140,@JetBlue and it was a problem on 5 of my last 8 flights. I tried different earphones also in case it was that but it was the actual seats.
40493,43149,@AlaskaAir I've been waiting for my bag for 24 minutes. How do I proceed with the 20 minute rule?
40495,43151,@DeltaAssist how come u guys don't have an email so I can email u my ticket stub for missing miles #partnerairline

40504,43160,@AlaskaAir just broke my bag. Never checking a bag with them again.
40510,43168,@JetBlue i hope you're gonna realise what you've done. the fuck dude
40519,43177,@JetBlue appalling non existent customer service. Watch out for Diana even opening your mouth to ask something is an issue for her.
40530,43189,@AlaskaAir Debbie on the CS team rocks! She solved our Thanksgiving travel problem. I'm proud to say #iflyala

40624,43293,@DeltaAssist Is it Delta policy to cancel the whole trip if one leg is cancelled?
40631,43301,@united The absolute worst thing you can do is lie to your customers. Just tell us it's a maintenance issue. Not air traffic control.
40640,43311,@SouthwestAir I missed my flight and your staff was accommodating as can be on a busy travel day. #thankyou
40642,43313,@VirginAmerica your website it pretty but it doesn't work. put in all my info and hit purchase but nothing happened. waste of my morning.
40650,43321,A big shout-out to the super-nice @VirginAmerica check-in team at SFO that just helped me find my lost ID....! #morningglory
40652,43323,Another @AmericanAir booking fiasco. No record of my return trip from CPT. 4th issue in 5 legs of this trip. #ruinahoneymoonglow
40653,43324,"So the flight crew ""timed out"". So we wait 8hrs for a 2 hr flight. @AlaskaAir Union rules to blame? http://t.co/9tE3hc0pGc"
40666,43338,I've never been so disappointed with MVP support @AlaskaAir. as a platinum card holder and frequent flier I'd expect better care.
40668,43341,@AmericanAir. maybe you should check your planes before you take off. 2 for 2 have failed. And we will miss our connection. Not okay.
40682,43355,.@united This is unacceptable https://t.co/z3g37HxbFq You need to rectify this ASAP.
40687,43360,@DeltaAssist our flight is arriving late and we will be the last off. Is it possible to back us up on the next flight to BHM 2374460851
40692,43365,Yo. @DeltaAssist the 7:15 out of Boise (delayed until 9:35) just had an issue with the landing gear.  Delayed again. Rebook to LA?
40693,43366,.@united forces sexual assault victim to take a later flight and let's assaulter board without issue. They'll never see another dime from me
40706,43380,@united Someone should get in touch with me. I don't especially want to be stuck in airports until fucking tomorrow.
40712,43386,My flights on @united airlines have gotten worse each time I've flown this past year. Time to find a new airline.
40721,43395,Not traveling today. but still feel I should remind everyone that @AmericanAir  is a terrible airline.
40722,43396,Is it a bad sign that most of @SouthwestAir tweets are apologies today?
40725,43399,Shout out to @AlaskaAir for always coming through when other airlines leave you hangin.
40727,43401,Reply to @DeltaAssist ohh that's too bad.

40765,43441,Will @JetBlue actually wait for passengers to arrive this time. or will they take off an hour early again? Time for #JetBlue Roulette!
40773,43450,So apparently @united doesn't care much about college students who have finals this week and they randomly cancel flights... #beyondpissed

41598,44313,@united so done with your shitty never on time airline.  Sincerely flight 1136.
41605,44320,If you're constantly weather delayed because SF is your hub...maybe move your headquarters? @VirginAmerica
41608,44323,guess who is never flying @JetBlue airways?! ME. don't freaking judge people by their appearance like wtf #BoycottJetBlue
41618,44333,@united i literally hate you so much
41625,44340,@SouthwestAir trying to go home but LAX-SFO 4665 been delayed 6hr w/ no guaranteed end. Can you tell us why? Will customers be compensated?
41631,44346,@VirginAmerica team members (yes. TWO of them) gave me info that led me to book and waste an incorrect flight. need to talk to a manager SOS
41634,44349,@AmericanAir that movie Jersey Boys was torture! Who picks your movies???
41641,44357,@DeltaAssist I've now been late to a wedding and will miss a doc's appt and half day off work
41647,44363,@AmericanAir any cyber Monday deals worth waiting to see before booking elsewhere?
41649,44365,@AmericanAir feedback: I wait longer for my bags at LAX than any other airport. La Guardia included! The later at night. the longer I wait.
41650,44366,@JetBlue cancelled my 7:01 AM LGB-OAK. Would appreciate switch to UA SNA-SFO 6 or 8AM rather than a 2:25 pm LAX-SFO VX flight.
41654,44370,Today I had the worst @united experience since the last time I flew United. Finally landed in Appleton but the rental places were closed.
41656,44372,@AmericanAir second time this year getting downgraded. This time due to two broken oxygen masks in first class
41658,44374,@united I will miss my exams tomorrow which will drastically affect my grades. But yeah everything's peachy.
41669,44387,@JetBlue please follow me so I can DM you a bad inconvenience I had in a recent flight to USA on JetBlue.

41722,44442,Hey. @AmericanAir are yall gonna talk to my professors?? I have class! 3 mechanical failures out of SJU!! STOP flying broken down planes!!!
41723,44443,@JetBlue It's absurd for an airline to prohibit a consumer from flying on the basis that they were dissatisfied with its costumer service.
41725,44445,@united your airline is a mess.
41727,44447,@AlaskaAir My flight time changed in APRIL AFTER I've booked it. ruining my drive home as friend lands earlier now.
41738,44458,Mechanical issues with @SouthwestAir flight....right on par. Nothing like paying extra for the earlier flight and coming in at a later time
41743,44464,@VirginAmerica Delayed last night out of AUS and rebooked today. Now today delayed bc of crew problems on your end. Miss 1st day at new job
41752,44473,Ugh @united has a really bad habit of regularly losing the sports equipment of professional athletes https://t.co/LMTdaEuut2

42211,44964,@DeltaAssist First off. you should have eliminated the $50pp charge. as we could have made an earlier flight w/ seats on it. Feeling trapped
42212,44965,I hate how @AlaskaAir uses first names to greet customers when they board. It's so unprofessional. And I don't even go by my first name.
42216,44969,@SouthwestAir bought mother ticket to fly for Thanksgiving. she changed her mind day of flight and will NEVER come! I paid. can I please use

43615,46454,"@AlaskaAir: Its no longer #CyberMonday Flights from $49 o/w http://t.co/3rjv6BKPyd"" once again. Alaska airlines aims to please! Love it!"
43619,46458,@AlaskaAir being delayed is ok but not being transparent about it is not. Flight showed on time on your site and app. http://t.co/h3iSsSenLv
43622,46462,@united I shared the complaint on the link you provided
43631,46472,@DeltaAssist How would I know that until now? It doesn't inform you of that option while waiting. Need to add more agents this time of year.
43633,46474,@DeltaAssist I have a major problem. I have flight on Friday. My seat was changed without my knowledge.
43644,46486,I miss flying @SouthwestAir  so much organization and efficiency there
43646,46488,I am so disappointed by @AlaskaAir and high traveling costs
43649,46491,@JetBlue So if I don't cancel. you keep all my money. And If I cancel. you keep all money too (my ticket was 150$). Now I understand. Thanks
43659,46501,@DeltaAssist but if i cancel it. i will receive nothing. as it was non-refundable :\
43660,46502,Captain says we're delayed because the door that holds the oxygen supply in place won't shut. I feel I can wait for this repair @AmericanAir
43674,46516,@VirginAmerica complete disappointment tonight. So disorganized. mayhem on the plane. Aside from getting home Sunday I'll never book again.
43679,46522,Can't wait to sleep like it's my job. @VirginAmerica's mood lighting and and an ativan should help. https://t.co/FspMFEOz0x
43692,46536,@SouthwestAir My flight is cancelled last minute? You sure feel a lot like United today.
43701,46545,@JetBlue Blast! I missed him! Thanks! The flight was great 
43702,46546,Missed flight .. No prob on the next one  @JetBlue to the rescue once again!!
43704,46548,@united your mechanical issue is about to make me miss a connecting flight to Aruba for my birthday!
43705,46549,waiting for this flight @AmericanAir . http://t.co/W7xh5GQTHB
43711,46555,@united oh. Ok. Guess I missed it then.
43712,46556,@united why are you suing skiplagged? You just lost me as a customer. and I'm sure many others #badmove
43715,46559,@united screws Cleveland again. http://t.co/3ksBHoeGcG
43727,46571,@DeltaAssist been there. done that. Don't want to miss the opportunity.
43734,46579,So close to @VirginAmerica Gold I can smell it.
43740,46585,I know it's all part of travel but @united is really bad. Tired of the late flights and missed connections. Taking my 1k travel elsewhere
43743,46588,@AmericanAir perhaps the first 767 judging by the smell of stale urine. When this concern was raised the crew merely dismissed my concern2/3
43744,46589,@united hi. my flight was cancelled on 30th Dec from Chicago to london. How do I request for a refund?
43746,46591,@DeltaAssist how should i change my first class flex tix to a flight where i see an open seat for a companion getting a one way tix? on hold
43748,46593,I love ya @JetBlue but broken TVs on my last two flights &amp; only my seat. Kinda makes me think you've got it out for me. #WhatHappenedToUs
43749,46594,Should have been in #Austin by now buy @united forgot to assign us a pilot! #ORD #oy! #delayed
43756,46603,@AmericanAir #americanairlinessucks
43757,46604,Free wifi thanks to Fly-Fi. Not a bad perk @JetBlue
43769,46616,Really @SouthwestAir ?! my two day vegas trip might just be stuck at the airport in #LAX
43776,46623,Dear @JetBlue . your new #TrueBlueBadges is amazing...and has officially ruined my productivity for today. #PointsPointsPoints
43781,46628,@united when was the last time you cleaned your plane #disgusting #sogross http://t.co/8Pl8oHyK5I
43799,46646,Top off MVP status? #MileageRun . LEAVE NOW: Anchorage-St Louis $526rt @alaskaair thru Dec 12. 6.296 EQM
43800,46647,@AmericanAir Sadly I have three flights booked. I have a case number &amp; medical documentation. &amp; never had to have either in previous flights
43804,46652,since @SouthwestAir no longer offers direct flights to SLC from select cities. that official airline schtick prob won't work. #Sundance2015
43808,46656,"How the heck am I supposed to eat a tube of hummus. @united?  The word ""dip"" is a tad misleading. don't you think?"
43810,46658,@united have not heard back! Revenue means more than actual flights and miles. This is bad business!
43819,46667,@United u wouldn't let me change my reservation online but you did cancel my flight. email got no reply. ridic call wait
43822,46670,@VirginAmerica forgot what a #rockstar airline this is.  Taking off from SFO.  Bye bye #UA and #AA. never again.
43829,46677,So @jetblue you banned someone from your airline over a tweet? Are you insane?
43835,46683,@JetBlue hear tell JetBlue is run by a bunch of pussies can't take the truth bet the CEO still sucks his mother's tit
43850,46699,@JetBlue ready and waiting for my forst flight with Jet Blue!
43853,46703,"@JetBlue Really banning someone over a stupid tweet? If your like all of the other airlines and so ""broke"" you'd better keep customers!"
43856,46706,bags arrived but #alaskaair damaged them. no more flying with @AlaskaAir
43857,46707,Does @JetBlue have CNBC or Bloomberg on the in-flight Direct #TV? I don't want to miss tomorrow's #jobs report! #travel #finance
43858,46708,How come I always end up with the one @JetBlue seat with a broken TV. #sadface http://t.co/YJPFvaPZ7u
43865,46715,Leave it to @SouthwestAir to have another delay tonight. I can't believe I continue to use you guys! http://t.co/BnFOarmwcy
43868,46718,@AmericanAir it was flight 1775; thankfully the delay was not long. but it was a mechanical issue. No Bangor. Maine (thank god)
43869,46719,@united I'm curious to know. how many flights a year on average are delayed on your airline? Cause IT FEELS LIKE A LOT!
43871,46721,Why is the last ELP--&gt;AUS flight ALWAYS delayed? In the past year. there hasn't been a single time I've flown on time. #bummed @SouthwestAir
43873,46723,@AlaskaAir Late flight but awesome flight staff. Thanks for getting my family home safe.
43880,46730,Thank you @VirginAmerica for resolving our issue. Can't wait to travel with you guys for the first time in Feb! #honeymoon #costumersfirst
43883,46733,@AmericanAir I realize the pilots are late but boarding a flight without the AC on is bold...
43886,46736,@SouthwestAir missing some fields. what goes where. Name first last http://t.co/hTY8cabbVy
43889,46739,@SouthwestAir oh my gosh wait I was just joking man.
43892,46742,Stuck at an airport in style. Thanks @VirginAmerica and staff for the impeccable service LAXLAS http://t.co/wCprqWl1jx
43903,46753,@united and so it begins. Flt delayed out if AUS no guarantee TPA flt will wait. Missed connection will cost big.
43906,46756,@AmericanAir why don't you cut our cc fees like you took away half of our benefits? Bad move.
43909,46759,@united your customer service is an undeniable living nightmare. I'm in Chicago waiting to board a flight to San Fran. MY FOURTH ATTEMPT
43910,46760,609 LAS-SEA @AlaskaAir; I always end up with the 90+min delayed flight. while all others are on time. Lame! Going to miss putting Hud to bed
43913,46763,Never realize how much I want TV. snacks and leg room until I don't have it. @JetBlue needs to fly to Nashville.
43918,46768,Hi @DeltaAssist I was having problem all night to check-in my flight Delta 7912 from KUL to ICN. Had SRVE0255E:WebGroup/Virtual not defined
43919,46769,@SouthwestAir's app could use some work. Past scheduled flight time. but delayed. Flight no longer shows up. Not in Past Flights. either.
43925,46775,@JetBlue TV out flying from MCO to BDL. ....kinda unhappy
43935,46787,@JetBlue #TrueBlue is broken. Last 2 years when I login I have 2 do it 20x b4 it knows me then I go to another sec &amp; it logs me out Hmph!
43938,46790,Do not fly @SouthwestAir they will have you wait 5 hours and then cancel your flight cold turkey &amp; then lie about the issue
43940,46792,@SouthwestAir cancelling flights into #LasVegas because of #fog that did clear up.  Why not wait and see before making a haste decision?
43945,46797,A 20year commitment &amp; @AmericanAir just gets worse. NONE of these shows were shown. &amp;your SW chixsalad was frozen!! http://t.co/Udnn0szL8J
43946,46798,@JetBlue just got a vm from JetBlue that we were getting a $279 credit per person for the delay? That's not what JetBlue GM promised!!!
43951,46804,International didn't cancel award txt last nght. online showing as ticketed. Reservation on hold expires tomorrow. Can u help? @AmericanAir
43956,46809,Plane door is stuck? Really @AmericanAir !?!?!
43981,46837,.@AlaskaAir Thanks for bringing #TBT to television. Love seeing those old commercials! Some things (like you) never change.
43984,46840,Thanks to @VirginAmerica once again for saving the day. Crappy 405 traffic made me miss my flight but Virgin just... http://t.co/BBuF6ibpTA

43991,46847,@AmericanAir killing me. Why does flightaware have more info than anyone that works on the plane? On Aa45 from JFK to Vegas
43996,46853,@SouthwestAir husbands plane Houston 2 STL routed 2 KC &amp; are telling them that stl weather is bad &amp; can't land?It's 40 no rain.ice or snow
44003,46860,@united another not on time performance flight 1266. whole flight is going to miss connections
44005,46862,@JetBlue you are very ignorant to have banned Matthew Lush. for no logical reason. #BoycottJetBlue
44016,46874,@VirginAmerica how much would it cost me to fly with my bunny? I don't want to leave her for the holidays!!!
44023,46882,@JetBlue my boyfriend broke his foot and we flew home the next day. he was in an ace bandage and crutches waiting to get home to get a boot
44024,46883,@united in Chicago waiting to board flight 2053 how can we leave at 9pm if we have not boarded by 9:15
44029,46888,@AmericanAir disappointing service. Missed connection - first leg was late and sec leg left early and you won't give me a room for the nite
44033,46892,@JetBlue guess I your not as lgbtq friendly as you make it if I could cancel my tickets I would #BoycottJetBlue
44047,46909,@AmericanAir We all deserve compensation since this is an AA problem. not ours. I could have been with family by now.
44049,46911,Excited to fly with @VirginAmerica for the first time! Not so happy about the weather delay though.
44056,46919,Exactly what I come to expect from @SouthwestAir an hr+ late on 2 flights today __ repeating #WeApologize doesn't help anyone.
44058,46921,@DeltaAssist your new FlyDelta 3.0 needs help - gets stuck on what's new screens - can't move off #delta - delete app I guess
44068,46934,Repeat: Thank God for salami. homemade kale chips + complimentary wine on @AlaskaAir on a 2 hr delayed flight home to #PDX. #eatingpaleo
44070,46936,Kudos @VirginAmerica VX490 crew to #Vegas handled that delay with poise &amp; patience. Everything I love about flying #VirginAmerica
44073,46940,@VirginAmerica hey VA! I booked a one way flight for 2 travelers and I am wondering if I can switch it to 1 round trip instead?
44082,46950,That was terrible @JetBlue - heat broken = 6 hour sweat box and 1st class NEEDED their signature cocktails while the peons waited to board.
44083,46951,@JetBlue 12 hours waiting to take off with 2 young kids. promised one way tickets to anywhere JetBlue flies by GM issued $289 credit. #lies
44084,46952,@AmericanAir correct guys! I don't like being disappointed either! I wanted to tweet from 32000ft! I'm hoping it will change before April!
44087,46955,@AmericanAir When do you plan to renew your 767-300 fleet? Business class mad-mia is really sad! You're out  of business.
44095,46965,Flight delayed. When you really need to be on time. Naturally. @JetBlue
44104,46975,@united Since when is security no longer forcing shoes off or having electronics out or 3oz or less liquids out of carry ons.
44108,46979,Waiting to board... Orlando. FL see you in 3 hours lol #JetBlue @jetblue #JetLife  http://t.co/zLDBJEEReo

44123,46997,Seeing all these Disney bags in the Orlando airport is killing me! But love that @JetBlue  now goes from SLC to MCO! #ohiobound
44126,47000,@VirginAmerica Had great flight on Weds. even with a bit of a delay. Once aloft. smooth sailing. Returning EWR to SFO on Monday. Yay!
44131,47006,@DeltaAssist I'm in seat 3D on DL2558 EWR&gt;ATL (late). Gonna miss connection. App: no options for new ATL&gt;LAX connex. Miserable. #getmehome
44136,47011,Oh GREAT. 2 crew down so @VirginAmerica CANCEL our flight. How to lose customers 101.
44148,47024,C'mon @JetBlue no wifi or inflight entertainment on a 5 hr trip to San Juan!!!  offering a measly $15 voucher isn't convincing me to return
44154,47030,.@VirginAmerica cancelled my parents' flight and didn't tell us. acted like it was a big deal to get a free replacement flight
44155,47031,@VirginAmerica  You lost a customer today. You Could not have been more unhelpful.
44177,47054,@AmericanAir if I had to cancel a flight. do I at least get credit for the flights to use at s different time?
44181,47058,The @united cattle call they call boarding gets worse and worse every time. Especially from non hub airports to hubs. Brutal w only 2 lines
44188,47065,Since I have only 2 flights today @United has only skewed up 50% still waiting on a late plane. Why must you suck so?
44190,47067,@JetBlue Cant wait to fly there with you next Friday.
44201,47078,Trapped on @JetBlue plane - bridge thing doesn't work. Do you guys fix anything??
44209,47088,@AmericanAir can you help me cancel a reservation? seem to have no luck doing it online.
44214,47095,Felt like a rock _ by way of pre-TSA check. Now doing standing stretches waiting for @united flight to board.
44216,47097,I miss babies! Come on @JetBlue ... Get me home!!
44220,47101,@united annoying men in the United club who don't know how to use their phones!  Lol
44225,47106,@united delayed again in San Francisco flight US 1677
44234,47115,There's a reason why @SouthwestAir is the best. Anytime I'm forced to fly another airline there is nothing but issues!
44236,47117,@VirginAmerica can't wait to travel later from Logan airport http://t.co/qOWBsDZsFz #FlyAwayFriday
44239,47120,@DeltaAssist I am swamped for time. I am frustrated just wondering if you can provide a miles credit?

44254,47135,@AmericanAir been standing in a cramped. freezing cold shuttle bus for 20 min at DCA gate 35x. Surely there is a better way to board.
44255,47136,@JetBlue thanks! It's flight 1115 from BOS to DFW. The crew is doing a great job keeping everyone on board happy despite the delay.
44263,47145,@VirginAmerica  wondering why vx 958 is delayed
44276,47158,@SouthwestAir how would I find out if I lost an orange makeup bag in your airplane? Date: November 23rd. 2014 flight #828 John Wayne airport
44277,47159,Flight delayed to 1:50pm and plane is not even here 3 @SouthwestAir flights I took in a row that is this way -_- http://t.co/PAukXCW5aM
44285,47168,Stuck in Chi-Town. Wasn't my choice to fly @SouthwestAir
44286,47169,@VirginAmerica is this a known issue??
44293,47176,@united Cancelled. And all I got was 2 meal tickets :/ http://t.co/X3S7b8SGjA
44295,47178,So @SouthwestAir remember when you wouldn't move me to an earlier flight because mine was going to leave at the same time?
44296,47179,Smells like someone put dirty socks in the air ducts! #replacefilters #smellyfeet ! @SouthwestAir
44297,47180,I swear everytime I catch the 725 flight from Jax to Bna on @SouthwestAir its always delayed. Yall need to tighten up
44303,47186,@united cancel refund request 8035246. i thought yall accidentally made a donation from my card. turns out my card number was stolen
44315,47198,Annoyed! Booked a flight on @VirginAmerica a little over 24 hours before I saw a great deal I could have used! #bleh #epicfail
44320,47204,I tried to leave at an earlier time but @AmericanAir has dumb policies. If there's open seats. what's the difference?
44337,47221,Miserable experience with booking online with American Airlines @AmericanAir . 1) Got error after submitting Credit Card info. __
44343,47227,If only @VirginAmerica flew to Orange County I wouldn't miss them so much. 
44355,47239,Getting alot of @united time from san deigo to PHX on a a320 and connecting from PHX to LAS with a delay on a a319 i cant deal with it.

44370,47255,@SouthwestAir do you no longer allow passengers to carry on bags? You better hope this makes it to Atlanta
44375,47260,@united if only your flights were as timely as your sad attempts at publicly viewable damage control.
44383,47268,trying to work but my @SouthwestAir wifi is SO BAD. Dial up R US is what it feels like today
44390,47277,@united app will tell me that my flight is delayed but where is option to check other flights?

44536,47432,@united Let Jeff eat the shit food served on UA. Jeff and Doug Parker are trying to run airlines in the dollar store mold. Fuck them both!
44541,47437,Never flying @united again. that's for fucking sure
44548,47444,@AmericanAir yes not sure what happens to the money I paid to upgrade my original flight and why it was cancelled since the plane is at phx

44576,47472,@united too bad it's going to be delayed or oversold
44582,47478,@DeltaAssist nightmare this am at JFK. Hate agent refused to honor my Alaska air MVP status even after speaking to AA agent n left open
44583,47479,Most likely never flying @AmericanAir again. General bitchery is not something I can deal with this early.
44592,47488,Managed to actually get on an hour earlier flight without a problem or charge. Reason No. 1.438.583 I love @jetblue
44596,47493,After a 45-minute delay due to a mechanical issue. we're finally on our way. Nicely done. @SouthwestAir!
44597,47494,On my way to Texas. but tempted to switch my flight to @united North Pole trip! http://t.co/hBxhziR2wN
44601,47500,@united my god. its like 90 degrees on this tiny plane waiting for everyone to board.  Can you guys fix this next time I fly?  Geez!!
44614,47515,@AmericanAir  i'll be waiting with bells on
44615,47516,@united can't wait to do Montreal-Houston but i'm a bit afraid of such a long route for a E70 :/
44622,47523,"No leg room and no TV on a ""leading national carrier."" This is why I fly @JetBlue whenever possible. #jetblue http://t.co/WwzkjOBIY1"
44630,47532,Honestly @united - why is your catering so gross? It's both stupidly done and poorly executed. What year is this?
44634,47536,Flight delay @AlaskaAir. cup 3 coffee 
44639,47542,@JetBlue Your guys were WONDERFUL in helping us with my Autistic child. getting her on the plane 1st last night after flight arrived late.
44642,47545,@AmericanAir I never have a complaint. I'll be flying your airline once again as I do exclusively to Los Angeles this week. You're the best!
44643,47546,bought flights on @SouthwestAir last week providence to orlando and the fares are way cheaper now than what I paid! sad 
44654,47557,@JetBlue BIG thanks to Luis! Seat arvd on nxt flt-we were still at car rental b/c of delay. He met us w/it in frnt of term. Above &amp; beyond!
44657,47560,Kuddos to @JetBlue - your lie flat seats from NYC to SFO are a game changer.
44671,47575,Ugh damnit @AlaskaAir you were absolutely perfect on my trip because of course you are. You always are. #goducks
44675,47579,@AlaskaAir my laptop that was in my baggage was damaged when it was put w cargo under plane after there not being any space in the overhead
44694,47599,@AlaskaAir help I'm about to miss flight as465
44695,47600,@AlaskaAir Flight delayed. then boarded. then mechanic issue n power cut. now 1.5 hrs after back in terminal waiting. Ancient filthy plane.
44709,47614,Flight 766 on @JetBlue has many TVs not working and their trying to say it's a satellite issue. I call bull since seat next to me is fine.
44711,47616,@AmericanAir just sprinted through the terminal only to find the only reason I__d miss my flight is because it took off 8 minutes early. WTF!
44714,47619,Ugh.. @AmericanAir change equipment on me today.. An old 737 is NOT a 767-800! #avgeeks #firstworldproblems
44719,47624,@united flight 1548 delayed EWR-MCO but crew was fabulous and so professional. They always do their best http://t.co/eQcjOUr00v
44731,47636,At least 5 #NERevs fans headed to LA for #MLSCup2014 on this @VirginAmerica flight out of BOS. Better late than never. #NERevsTrip
44735,47640,@JetBlue is  bad with everything and always have status MOSAIC I do not understand the delays now in orlando
44759,47667,The CEO of @VirginAmerica was a high school dropout. Just irritates me when people assume the worst for a individual who dropouts. Example
44768,47677,@VirginAmerica - I regularly fly back and forth from Cali to New York. This happened before and I couldn't board a flight. Disappointed.
44777,47687,@DeltaAssist huh? $10 cheaper? I found them from 500-1500 cheaper. Competitive? How is longer &amp; way more money flights keep u competitive?
44778,47688,@AmericanAir i lost my especial ring yesterday!  I flew from ny to dallas and Mexico. have found someone?
44789,47699,@JetBlue Weather conditions made it necessary for us to make a pit stop. Wasn't their fault but they still gave me a credit. Thanks.
44795,47709,@united No baggage off planes at ORD!? When planes r late still need crews to unload duh. #stupidUAL #annoy
44797,47711,@AlaskaAir Eh. wasn't the worst thing in the world. Got to hear some awful made up songs about the Seattle airport.
44798,47712,@DeltaAssist flight home for holidays w/my ESA rebooked for tomorrow bc of mechanical issues...very stressful day!
44801,47715,@americanair pathetic - still waiting to move a foot
44804,47718,@DeltaAssist  I called that number they did nothing for me!! Very upset! Never gonna fly delta again!!
44808,47722,@AmericanAir No...I booked with Iberia. But entered my AA number. Is not a booking issue it is an issue of fidelity programme compliance.
44813,47729,I hope that this time @JetBlue doesn't mess things up - #damage my #baggage
44815,47731,@DeltaAssist I fly in a CRJ-200 tomorrow with no upgrade opportunities and i'm really mad you discontinued the HOOU coups as a PM flyer!!!
44819,47735,@SouthwestAir App not working. Suggestions?
44830,47749,I've never flown @SouthwestAir before today. I'm nervous because I don't think I understand their boarding process...
44855,47774,True Life: My 1K husband abandons me at airport security. I can't be mad though. I'm using his @United Club membership and 1st class tickets
44858,47777,@DeltaAssist needing retraining on friendliness - flying is stressful enough
44859,47778,Just watched half empty plane leave 4 AUS w/o me. Standby = $200! A+ comp pass status meaningless-- bullshit @SouthwestAir
44863,47782,@AmericanAir Flight got delayed? Try #WorldMate and get push messages with real-time flight status. Try it http://t.co/giuUM7vmIM
44865,47784,"@SouthwestAir Flight 514 DCA to BNA ""Delayed NTP""?  How quickly will that be resolved?"
44879,47799,Flying @virginamerica for the first time. So far not bad
44883,47804,@AmericanAir really pushing my patience today... Flew phx to Mia with roller carryon no problem. Mia to Kingston agents say won't fit #usuck
44888,47809,Every time I fly through ATL it's something going to miss the game smh @DeltaAssist
44889,47810,Small plane no outlets and gum stuck to the side of my seat really @AmericanAir
44907,47829,@united once again a west to east coast flight. No wifi on board. UA134 #comeonman
44910,47832,.@united lies? Reports ORD-MEX 359 late due to late inbound. Truth is it's grounded 2:27 delay for repairs; incomer landed 30' early.
44921,47845,@VirginAmerica cant wait to experience this airline !!!
44922,47846,@DeltaAssist every single time I have flown you this has happened what are the odds? Never again
44930,47854,@united trip of a lifetime to Norway off to a bad start!
44931,47855,@VirginAmerica How do I get bag-check refund? (Paid to check; no longer need to.)
44935,47859,@DeltaAssist is theranyway to do the claim online. We left the airport didn't anyone from Delta anywhere it was late http://t.co/9xRD9nWv9F
44939,47863,@JetBlue I'm disappointed! Wanted to give gift cards to family for Christmas and can't! Can't gift points w/o their TB# either! Bah Humbug!
44947,47871,I &lt;3 @SouthwestAir and their inflight TV and WIFI...why didn't they have this 20 years ago? (wait never mind just answered my own questions
44949,47873,@VirginAmerica Cant wait to travel here again soon. Loved the view of the puget sound from the top of the space needle :)
44954,47878,@united - When you cancel a flight you must prepare to make the travelers whole. #flyanythingelse
44957,47881,Missing @JetBlue right now. #MLScup going to start and Delta doesn__t have live TV! ;-( #GoRevs
44958,47882,I kid you not. my @JetBlue pilots are Jed Schmed and Moose McGhee.  Yup.  At least they've made the 30 min ground delay amusing.
44963,47887,A new record. @AmericanAir lost not one but two of our bags. And broke the third. They had to ziplock it shut. #Argh http://t.co/TRqIPm61VT
44970,47896,@AlaskaAir always loved flying with you until now! LAX to STS now stuck in Oakland.#fogsucks
44973,47899,Oh no.... cancelled end of year trip (more time with #family) but going to miss @united #platinum this year #dissapointed
44975,47901,Like flying with @AmericanAir but tired of always being delayed.  There is never a flight I've been on that's on time.
44976,47902,@AmericanAir  Hi. after our last tweets I got a call about the issue. but still waiting 6 weeks on for full resolution. Follow up please?
44981,47907,@DeltaAssist We're now delayed on the plane due to a mechanical issue with the lavatory door sound  going off every 30 seconds...my oh my.
44983,47910,Thanks for the upgrade @AlaskaAir. can't wait to be back in 54 degrees and sunny in Seattle
44984,47911,@united Yes. the bag will be retrieved from Newark. where you sent it. to come home a day late to Chicago. Had hoped for better trip karma.
44987,47915,@DeltaAssist me and 3 coworkers r scheduled fl1824 out of bwi Stuck n traffic bcuz of accident - will we e able 2 get on anthr flight 2nite?
44998,47927,I guess the #honeymoon had to end sometime. Delayed @SouthwestAir flight back to #sandiego. At least they're showing #football on the tv's.
45003,47933,Why are my flights always delayed? @united
45007,47938,RDU to JFK. @americanair this tired girl cant wait to get home. #sundayfunday
45017,47948,@AlaskaAir I think the issue is re. cookies. of which I disable for travel sites. after reading reports of them being used for price-fixing.
45018,47949,.@united Not impressed at LAX  w/ur poor planning on capacity at U Club. Staff is great-shouldn't be put in these circumstances
45039,47971,Upset ELP Premium ckin wouldn't check my bag thru to AKL tonight @AmericanAir. especially when you are delayed.  You've done it before.
45041,47973,So excited to be in my hometown of NYC right now as this movement has gone national. Never mind that @JetBlue lost my luggage.
45044,47976,Too bad @SouthwestAir doesn't fly from Jax to Birmingham anymore otherwise I would probably go. Damn.
45051,47984,Lost bag @AmericanAir doing there best to destroy my vacation now no cycling shoes to ride the bike I rented.
45052,47985,Oh. just been sitting on the tarmac at FLL. waiting for @JetBlue to find us a gate. #HurryUpPlease
45053,47986,@DeltaAssist so I called you number. waited and then was advised you're too busy to answer my call and to call later...  Wrong!!!
45054,47987,So I guess it was just a matter of time before @AmericanAir disappointed me...
45079,48012,@VirginAmerica I'm trying to check in now or I will be late
45090,48023,@AmericanAir they where told where this time. They are stuck at Dallas.
45091,48024,I have flown so much lately and @americanair is full of  when they say they are getting new planes every week. #lies #shittyplanes
45092,48025,S/o to Jeff @SouthwestAir for getting me on a earlier flight than my delayed flight. That's what I'm talking about! #imcominghome
45093,48026,@americanair Why does your plane smell like old fish tonight?? And I'm not the only one on here that smells it.....
45094,48027,@AmericanAir oh I'm sure. Honestly. I don't even know where to start. You've lost a very loyal flier.
45097,48030,Dude in this @SouthwestAir commercial is not only wearing an awful three piece suit but forgot he had jeans on?
45104,48037,Because @SouthwestAir is open seating Howard and I are in 2 seperate places ___ I'm sad. More worried about him. he's afraid of flying.
45110,48043,@AlaskaAir and Delta does transport pits so it's all just an excuse.
45113,48046,3 of 4 flights delayed this week! The only thing worse than @united are the impatient. obnoxious strangers I'm stuck with on this plane.
45126,48059,@DeltaAssist they had me supposedly on tomorrow flt as back up but that cancelled me for tonight. Is that a system issue or what?
45133,48066,Now I know why I never fly @AlaskaAir
45141,48074,@united__s latest marketing video talks about insights from CX survey. Can__t wait to see what actions are coming as a result! #custexp
45146,48079,"Do not scream ""oh no"" on the airplane even if your team almost loses the ball. And thank you @JetBlue for free live TV."
45151,48085,I sadly have to fly @SouthwestAir. Their choose your own seat is incredibly stressful for parents with children. I will never use them again
45156,48090,Flight attendants are killing it right now on my flight from NYC-&gt;SFO. @VirginAmerica #VX29
45162,48097,@DeltaAssist Sending a DM regarding an issue with seat assignments. (Have a infant in car seat placed in front of an exit row.)
45167,48102,@DeltaAssist No problem. However the US doesn't open until 1800 local time. Where can I call that could handle now?
45172,48107,@DeltaAssist my wife has a flight out of Las Vegas Wed. but would like to leave tomorrow. What's the process for getting an early flight?
45177,48112,@DeltaAssist appears phones stop after midnight Eastern - is calling tomorrow too late since my flight landed at 1145PM tonight?
45188,48124,@AmericanAir yes. Manc to Chicago. Other highlights were 3 drinks services all at once followed by hours of drought &amp; lies re beer stock
45189,48125,Here's hoping this flight on @AmericanAir isn't delayed due to too many flights flying out #travelswithmarkdrum #goinghome #nyc #flight3601
45190,48126,Only @united can screw up a perk like #tsapre - put me in wrong line and then force me to walk around the Tropic of Capricorn to get back
45200,48136,Made the @AlaskaAir mvp program with my flights last month after  no flights Jun-Oct. at least I get to enjoy it for two flights. eh? :)
45202,48138,@DeltaAssist 4 different planes in 4 days and I never saw one anywhere
45222,48160,@united Part of LAX club closed due to pipe issue and would not accept passes. We understand things happen. but frusted to waste passes.
45223,48161,@DeltaAssist how do I not have a seat when I purchased reg tickets not standby?! This is bullshit! #SanDiego
45226,48164,@AmericanAir flying to JFK-STT on AA1275.First the plane didn't have lie flats as scheduled which I paid up for. now we are delayednoupdate.
45235,48173,@united would it kill you to offer real coffee  creamer? 2% only? Come on. How much does a box of mini moos cost in bulk?
45236,48174,As someone who flies @SouthwestAir about once a month. it is shocking that they can never send me drink tickets.
45238,48176,Woah woah woah @JetBlue let's slow down a bit http://t.co/Sg7nGbepFF
45247,48185,missed a flight yesterday afternoon and @AmericanAir has not had one opening since then? totally missing work today. idk what to do
45255,48193,@SouthwestAir do swaps happen between SWA &amp; FL flights? I want to book my first FL flight on 12/28 ATL-MCI 5601. but don't want it to switch
45271,48209,You're killin' me @united . Why are your planes always broken when I'm trying to fly somewhere?
45274,48212,@VirginAmerica where do I submit the request for missing Elevate points?
45278,48216,@united The form is broken and will not accept my email address. Says they don't match altho they do. Please send an email address I can use
45287,48226,@AmericanAir close to 500k miles flown with you and the airline &amp; service only gets worse. Gonna take my business miles &amp; trips elsewhere.
45300,48239,"@AlaskaAir I did. All I was told was ""it must have happened at departure"". I had a shuttle waiting so I didn't have time to argue about it."
45301,48240,@JetBlue you lost my bag!  It's full of baby clothes. It is a non stop. Terrible. Whole bunch of us from 465 including a guys wheelchair.
45309,48248,@DeltaAssist Can I please get a number to reach the main office for Lost &amp; Found?
45310,48249,Hey @AmericanAir what's missing from this picture of $$ seat 20C on AA78 5/12?  The remote control. ripped from seat. http://t.co/LIkU6NBUCV
45317,48256,@AmericanAir Second time in a row AA stops the plane on the tarmac for mechanical fixes for over 30minutes with no A/C
45325,48264,Honoured to chair for next year new taskforce on illegal wildlife trade on behalf of The Duke of Cambridge @United 4Wildlife #RoyalVisitUSA
45332,48271,. @AmericanAir At what point is it ok to ask the flight attendant for a drink? Do you have to wait for the little cart?
45335,48274,I seriously wish @JetBlue flew from/to FAT. I hate having to fly using the big 4.. United. AA. USAIR. Delta--&gt; step your game up.
45336,48275,Weird that @SouthwestAir would cancel a flight for no apparent reason and there are no more flights available today? You can do that?
45339,48278,I never weary of the view out my @AmericanAir window.#stormy #peekingsun #pillows http://t.co/xD0xJDYNbE
45340,48279,@JetBlue and the WHOLE can of Coke. Can't wait for the snacks :) #Itsthesimplethings
45352,48293,@AmericanAir one more fee and does nothing for seat width = cramped body and lighter wallet :(
45357,48298,@AmericanAir Improve flights reliability #goingforgreat between Shreveport and Dallas.  Habitually flights are cancelled or late.
45372,48316,Cannot wait for @VirginAmerica to expand their destinations _ #bestairline
45374,48318,@AmericanAir How about more legroom in coach?  It's not like this complaint hasn't been voiced before?!
45378,48322,@SouthwestAir delayed again..?!? in New York. hope I get home to Nashville.Tn tonight.!!!!!
45381,48325,Fly away with me stuck in my head after flying @VirginAmerica lol
45385,48329,@DeltaAssist is there a change fee waiver in place for flights into jfk tomorrow? Weather forecast looks horrendous
45400,48344,This is the 5th time the @AmericanAir has made me stuck at airport. You think I would learn
45410,48355,@JetBlue Why is flight 1116 delayed out of Tampa. destination LaGuardia?
45416,48361,glad @VirginAmerica fixed a system issue so I could book flights home for the holidays. Darlene was extremely nice and polite.
45428,48375,@DeltaAssist I am flying from SEA 12/15. I hope to get my double miles as your homepage says. Though link is broken. http://t.co/HIWsyo4kUt
45438,48387,I would like to report that our check in for @AlaskaAir was superb today. The agent helped us with our boxes of wine and we didn't wait!

45460,48409,I have been having problems with partner flights crediting properly to @AlaskaAir _. #sadface
45462,48411,TRAPPED IN AIRPORT PURGATORY!Standby since 9am. Looks like I might be AWOL for the 1st time in my 11yr career. @AmericanAir #FarFromGreat
45466,48415,@JetBlue rescheduled all 4 legs of my trip. making the return inconvenient into the bargain.  Last time I'll fly anywhere except NYC w/them.
45478,48427,What's up @SouthwestAir? Third time in four Sacramento trips ainxe April a flight cancelled on me. Driving next time.
45483,48432,@SouthwestAir You're killing me... sitting on this 737-300 at TPA (TPA-BDL) for 2 hours hoping that they resolve a mechanical issue...
45485,48435,Not applicable. @DeltaAssist:  Although we try to confirm as many complimentary upgrades as possible. there are never guaranteed. *ME
45487,48437,@DeltaAssist I've been trying to resolve an issue from April of this year. 2014. It's about to be April of next year. 2015.
45500,48451,@AmericanAir disappointed in your airline yet again. We always have a problem
45507,48459,Stuck here with no bag or clothes for work tomorrow because @united sent my bag to Chicago not Fargo. MN. I need to work tomorrow!
45513,48466,Airline says maintenance issue. not a bird. cracked windshield http://t.co/epPCVvP2N5 @united
45516,48469,Still waiting @SouthwestAir  http://t.co/WujQNhT7OO
45532,48486,Lost luggage for 1st time @VirginAmerica ! Super bummed out. I hope it comes home soon. #elevategold :::points to miles bank. insert here:::
45539,48493,Thank you Valentine from @jetblue flight #112 for helping me through my fear of flying. Best flight and amazing people &lt;3
45540,48494,After my last trip. I am 1384 miles and $88 away from attaining Gold status on @United Mileage Plus. Ugh... So close... so close...
45542,48496,@JetBlue Iiiiiii'm back!!!!!! I miss my airline :'(
45546,48500,@AmericanAir bro. my flight from palm springs was supposed to leave at 11 this morning and I was supposed to be in Wichita by 7
45549,48503,Skywest stopping all flights out of Carlsbad. CA as of 4/1/15. Totally screwed up our @United Airlines reservations. Grrrrr.
45553,48507,Every time I fly .@VirginAmerica it brings back memories of when PHL welcomed them. Come back. I miss u #DayDreaming http://t.co/ofoctwztvT
45556,48511,Apparently our @united Captain didn't know he was flying us home and we had to wait for his arrival at the airport. http://t.co/0hMcf4IPSA
45566,48523,OK so #Cortana says my flight is delayed but #flydelta saying its on time. #whoisright? Cc: @DeltaAssist - its 4650 http://t.co/GPQDadVVaL
45567,48524,On my way back to #NYC with @VirginAmerica flight delayed #needirishcoffee #whereistheflightcrew
45581,48539,@AmericanAir Could you please confirm an email address or fax number for me to forward a complaint and compensation claim letter to.
45604,48564,@DeltaAssist On upgrade wait list using globals on Dec 13th LAX-NRT-SIN.  How likely to clear before flight?
45606,48566,@SouthwestAir problem was name - I was married recently. &amp; couldn't change it online...do I really need to send a copy of my marriage cert?!
45620,48582,@DeltaAssist do you have weather advisory for SJ yet? There is bad weather coming in to SJ starting this Wednesday evening
45624,48587,@AmericanAir crud. I'm guessing it's too late to do that for our flight tonight.
45631,48594,@AlaskaAir The Insider promo page for today is broken. The Fare Rules are out of date and the Flights From drop down menu gives no choices.
45635,48598,@AmericanAir crushed it w/ cust. serv. for my fianc. Had emergency and bought tix 12/8 to fly 12/10 but had to cancel this AM. 100% refund!
45639,48602,@AmericanAir why did you reduce the MD-80 fleet into and out of ELP? CRJ's are extremely inconvenient.
45640,48603,Last work trip of the year. Sad I'm not gonna make it Platinum. but there's always next year @AmericanAir
45644,48607,@AlaskaAir was QXE486 cancelled because of winds in Bellingham. or are there other factors changing flight schedules today as well?
45645,48608,Need help we had a flight through delta and got rerouted due to a mechanical airplane error .2 days of flying with 2 babies @DeltaAssist
45647,48610,@JetBlue Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. here we come. Never had any way to go to Cleveland before.
45655,48618,@united that's a complete lie.   You no longer earn miles from flying. You earn based on spend. It's supposed to be a FREQUENT FLYER program
45660,48623,@DeltaAssist I'm on DL 2142 to EWR but see all the delays any way I can switch to DL2042 now?  I'm Silver Medallion.
45661,48624,@SouthwestAir Your rep should have told me that adding a middle name to my reservation would cancel my check in! #unhappycustomer #wtf
45668,48631,@AmericanAir AA1200 again.  3rd near miss.  CO/Kansas boarder.  Another regional jet - this one looked closer.  Wake up air traffic control
45672,48635,@JetBlue I can't believe you delayed my flight I'm crying
45680,48643,@DeltaAssist i flew vgn atlantic and gave my skymiles # but never got pts. im flying lots the next 10 days and need those pts for status
45681,48644,Pressurization issue mid-flight on @AmericanAir to Maui. Landed safely back at lax. Now just hoping they can get us a new plane soon!
45688,48652,I was so excited to get on the plane to go to Disney to find it's delayed _ @JetBlue
45696,48660,I thought I'd never live to see the day @JetBlue would again fly to Ohio.
45697,48661,Why does it feel like every single time I fly @AmericanAir through Dallas there's always an issue?
45703,48667,Love @VirginAmerica. Always great flight. Not sure I like Love Field. almost an hour on Tarmac w/no gate.
45705,48669,@SouthwestAir Really? 2 of my flights cancelled for no reason.  I've been at SF forever.
45707,48671,@AmericanAir it sucks to arrive late. so I nearly miss my next flight. just to find you've closed the flight early. I could have made it.
45710,48675,Photo: #InstaSize earlier today at the gate for #usairways new @AmericanAir we waited! (at Sacramento... http://t.co/EbjUM9u1D4
45716,48682,30 minute flight delay = free water and snacks? Great first experience with @JetBlue ... #CustomerService
45717,48683,The folks from @united leave you on a plane for 90 extra minutes after a 12hrs flight and to compensate they give you 2k miles. Really?
45725,48691,@AmericanAir Disabled on lmtd/fxd income. U screwed up flights 4 March 19-24. No more direct flights w/12.5k miles RT w/o extending stay.
45730,48696,@united not at all but my plane at #ind is having problems and I will most likely miss my connection.  We will see.
45732,48698,@SouthwestAir has had me on hold for like 10 years I don't even remember why I called
45735,48701,@AmericanAir isn't changing the fare as I'm confirming paying with my credit card considered a form of bait and switch!!! #nothappy
45746,48714,@united Are you offering a waiver to change flights into SFO ahead of this storm. and. if so. when will it kick in?
45747,48715,Because of @SouthwestAir and being stuck in the Air in Dallas flying in a circle. I missed my connect flight and Interview for a job in L.A
45758,48726,Really @JetBlue you guys roll like that? An additional $100 plus difference for a couple of days #WorstAirline #NeverAgain
45759,48728,@SouthwestAir why'd you leave me hangin'? no follow up?
45765,48736,@AmericanAir has flight 3341 to Dallas been rebooked for those stuck in Abilene. TX?
45766,48737,@VirginAmerica how are BOTH your inbound flights to Newark late? Not stoked to be arriving in LA from the east coast after midnight
45773,48744,@AmericanAir I have had two cancelled flights and now this plane has a flat tier. Will be choosing some else next time.
45775,48746,@DeltaAssist flight DL5680 just cancelled takeoff during throttle. Werid what's going on? Let us know. http://t.co/1wApCMsDTQ
45787,48758,Hey @United you're a real peach. Aircraft maintenance is not an issue out of your control. call you in a few... http://t.co/tBwSG0Jv5g
45788,48759,Why does @AmericanAir constantly cancel flights from DFW to GRK!!?! #notmilitaryfriendly
45792,48763,@AmericanAir The Rebooked Desk at MIA out of control and respect to paxs...train them to handle problems!!! #AAYaghhh!
45796,48767,@JetBlue just broke my heart. http://t.co/xMKnmFloHN baggage fee and less leg room SMH guess I will fly any airline now.
45800,48771,@DeltaAssist when I press to view my boarding pass this is the screen I see. Is this a known issue? http://t.co/rACJnScMRz
45803,48774,@VirginAmerica really really hope my flight isn't too delayed to NYC friday. fingers crossed
45806,48777,@DeltaAssist this 1k flier was starting to warm to Delta with the unexpected upgrade... Until they took it after board! Hate It more now...
45808,48779,@VirginAmerica Just received some not so merry &amp; bright customer service when canceling a flight due to bad news. Tis the season?
45812,48783,"Last business trip of the year ends in a travel disaster - ""extended mechanical delay"". #missedconnection cc: @united"
45817,48788,Crew member James on VX357 just danced up &amp; down the aisle. acting out the entire @VirginAmerica safety video. Passengers grinning like mad.
45819,48790,In light of my crappy experience w/ @United today. I share with you the Value of Miles and Points http://t.co/DI6VSfXQmW #travel
45825,48797,Flight delayed to honor a solider killed in the line of duty. So touching even flight crew was crying. @SouthwestAir http://t.co/ctEIlH3Bu6
45831,48804,Wish @JetBlue flew more places from SLC. The other airlines suck or charge too much. Delta now charging more to choose a seat? No thanks.
45832,48805,I used to be a fan of @united   I will no longer fly with them after how they treated me.  #NeverAgain
45836,48810,I've never had a bad day with @AmericanAir. Today's delays did not go in my favor though. Missing that chipotle deadline in Fresno :(
45839,48813,Kinda shitty that @JetBlue couldn't add NYC to the list for nonstop from Cleveland. Looks like I'm stuck taking Greyhound to see my uncle.
45845,48820,@DeltaAssist if I have to cancel a flight I used miles &amp; cash on. am I able to get my miles refunded back? I dont want to lose 25.000 miles!
45846,48821,@VirginAmerica what the heck is up with the website!? I've been trying to log in to the 'manage' page for over 20 minutes
45849,48824,So I guess we're all gonna pretend this @SouthwestAir flight doesn't smell like an unflushed toilet?
45857,48832,@VirginAmerica hate to complain but you're not making me a believer. 6:30 SFO =&gt; LA and no crew. 2nd flight is as many days not going well.
45858,48833,@united is holding UA3696 for a passenger.  I sure hope they wait for me next time and have accurate status update. #notmaintenance
45867,48842,@AmericanAir when am I going to receive my Platinum card? As a Gold member I never got the card...
45877,48853,@united #badcustomerservice i have sent emails ! Thats my proof!
45879,48855,@VirginAmerica Swing by anytime. We'll have a seat saved and a drink waiting. Cheers!
45880,48856,@SouthwestAir why am I stuck in New Jersey watching planes take off?
45882,48858,@VirginAmerica flight vx0236 LA to Chicago flight crew rocks. First round trip with you all. and I can't wait to fly with you again.
45895,48871,@DeltaAssist how will i check the status of my reimbursement for the bagggage delay? I'm in Australia and that was ATL-TYS via DL3281 Nov1
45896,48872,@VirginAmerica ok I can't wait to stay here... Any other locations plannef
45897,48873,@DeltaAssist Just worked with Terry on the phone on a gift cert issue. One of the best support experiences I have had with any company.
45903,48879,Did @SouthwestAir  really have me on hold for 42 minutes and still no answer? I certainly hope they match today's rate when they call back.
45908,48884,@VirginAmerica never had a chance to fly VA. Never had a destination to use them. but want too.
45909,48885,@VirginAmerica Never going to fly Virgin America again. My baggage was severely damaged and no one available at SFO to address the situation
45917,48895,Two days of this @AmericanAir nonsense http://t.co/GCPBZwBJdb
45918,48896,@AmericanAir was looking at booking a flight and not 10 minutes later it jumped about 40 per person for the same tickets! #NotSatisfied #bad
45923,48905,Your staff are rude to me until they see my airline status @VirginAmerica - this isn't right. Should always be nice
45932,48915,If I'm gone miss the first part of my round trip ticket does that close the second leg of it? @united
45937,48921,@AmericanAir By the time my flight  cancelled. I didn't have time to eat. It's now am. how bout some breakfast?
45946,48932,@AmericanAir that it is! Can't wait to see what Miami has in store!
45948,48934,@DeltaAssist What? No Pre-Check at JFK Terminal 2 at 8 AM?!?!  So inconvenient.
45951,48937,@AmericanAir what is the reason for the delay on 2965 today? 2 flights go out on same route and parents still in terminal
45954,48940,So very happy @JetBlue is coming to #CLE . Offsets the shit sandwich addition of Spirit nicely.
45955,48941,@DeltaAssist is there a problem checking in online from Tel Aviv? I keep on trying &amp; I get an error message that I need to go to airport
45956,48942,This is insane @SouthwestAir flight landed with one more passenger than when it took off. A baby was born mid-air http://t.co/vqT2rhrMBS_
45960,48946,And of course flights delayed and now we have an extra flight to Mayi. @AmericanAir what the heck?!
45965,48951,@AlaskaAir trying to call 703-417-1085 to check on my lost bag. Always a busy signal?
45983,48969,.@AmericanAir__s first 787 delivery delayed to 2015: http://t.co/uJOSV2UJ5s
45987,48973,@SouthwestAir   Why is there always an issue with your planes in Chicago?
45988,48974,#UCCan benefit plans members: give us your email &amp; never miss updates on pay/pension/benefits! MinistryandEmployment@united-church.ca
45993,48979,@DeltaAssist I was just reviewing my sky miles and I feel like I'm missing almost 10k mqm's for this year. can you clear it up for me?
45994,48980,More reason to keep flying @SouthwestAir.. Could Coach Get Any Worse? Delta Found a Way with New Class of Fares https://t.co/eXb5sSbvXH
46002,48989,If taking off 45 minutes late is cool. then @JetBlue is Miles Davis.
46009,48996,@DeltaAssist I had to cancel a flight but have some credit leftover. how do I apply that to the flight I'm actively trying to book?
46011,48999,A bit peeved @southwestair made me pay extra for a worse itinerary going out tonight to avoid nasty San Francisco storm tomorrow.
46013,49001,@DeltaAssist    I should have stuck with you guys and my 5 million miles. but I couldn't pass on their non-stop. Should've known better.
46016,49004,I had the most amazing &amp; compassionate service from @JetBlue yesterday when I had to cancel a last minute flight. Thank you!
46031,49021,@VirginAmerica Virgin peeps. I lost my drivers license on flight VX2 09NOV14. I got a call that you'd mail it to me. i've not rec'd it yet
46032,49022,Phew!  Was able to change my @VirginAmerica ORD-&gt;SFO flight to today to miss the epic storm tomorrow.
46040,49030,@DeltaAssist the new app is inconvenient.  It's too cumbersome to find flights.
46048,49040,@americanair ...15th attempt.Could you let your IT folks know there's a problem of some sort?Happened to me last time I flew with U too. 2/2
46063,49055,@AlaskaAir beat my suitcase up so bad. I'm expecting to see a video of it on WorldStarHipHop later today.
46064,49056,SO excited @JetBlue is coming to Cleveland!! Been waiting for this day! #wanderlust _
46070,49062,Back row of a regional jet - no window. Missing @SouthwestAir today but only one way on this heartless machine. Back to the #luv on Friday
46074,49066,@united I'm very upset as our luggage didn't arrive with us after being diverted to panama from bogota on UA 1006. No notification emails.
46083,49075,@VirginAmerica another great flight. Turbulent-free :) Lil issue w/the Dish but otherwise it was all good. http://t.co/JOTY4BEJlr
46085,49078,By the end of the year I will have missed hitting Platinum status with @AmericanAir by only 13K miles. _ #frequentflyer #AAdvantage
46088,49081,@AlaskaAir I wore my Russell Wilson jersey from SJC to SEA today and didn't get to board early. I'm disappointed! http://t.co/GQJ91pQLjJ
46089,49082,@united ua5769 appears to be delayed. Is there an earlier flight I can take?
46090,49083,@VirginAmerica is there a chance my flight's delay will be reversed? Should I show up at the airport on regular or delayed time? Thx.
46093,49086,@AmericanAir Flight 2206 leaves Miami for DCA at 4:05pm but we are stuck in line at Miami going to passport control
46095,49088,@AlaskaAir What's the best time to buy your alaska airlines visa credit card? Can't wait for that companion pass.
46098,49091,This bad boy is taking us to NYC today @JetBlue #UCFlyMCO #WheelsUp http://t.co/TWuJgcZGF2
46104,49097,Can't wait @AmericanAir http://t.co/ua6ca0vYZE
46107,49101,So @SouthwestAir broke the handle on my bag from Chicago to NYC and they say it not covered- maybe I need to find another airline #NotHapoy
46111,49105,@AmericanAir #2846.Got to Chicago but paid $160 for rental car. Weather excuses during non-weather issues makes me skeptical
46118,49114,Can't wait to @JetBlue out of town tomorrow night
46119,49115,@SouthwestAir scheduled to fly out of LGA on Fri. Can I push my flight back a day without incurring extra charges in light of bad weather?
46126,49122,@AlaskaAir you're voice activation for phone calls is not working. Will not pick up voice commands. What is a number without a robot?
46138,49136,@alaskaair A cancelled flight ruined the trip I saved for all summer. Thanks for making it right without being asked. #warmfuzzies
46139,49137,#roc to #lasvegas  in the AM on @SouthwestAir hoping the flight doesn't get cancelled!
46140,49138,This is my 25th @SouthwestAir flight this year and I don't think I single one of them have been on time. Maybe I need to switch airlines lol
46142,49140,@DeltaAssist Yes. First I was told it was weather. Then mechanical. There are no flights. My wife and kids have been at LAX since 10:45.
46147,49146,@JetBlue love jet blue tell everyone to fly it. I use it all the time but feeling a little put off with excuse
46150,49149,@AlaskaAir  My frustration with your airline is at an all time hight. i will never fly with you again &amp; will close out my AA CC
46156,49155,@JetBlue Where is flight #890 coming from hence the delay departing DCA?
46159,49158,@united thumbs Down!!!!!!
46161,49160,@united my confirmation is CD35DY STL-IAH-LAX. I have united flight tomorrow LP39V4. I'll sprint between terminals but please wait
46162,49161,@AmericanAir you did not cancel. a lot of people where not able to board in Chile cos they had the old passport. including my mom
46165,49164,@VirginAmerica any chance that VX29 JFK to SFO will be cancelled?
46171,49171,I seriously don't want to be stuck in Baltimore. please tell me flight 3303 to MCO is going to wait for delayed flights. @SouthwestAir
46175,49175,1/4 Flew from Miami to JFK on @AmericanAir today. Arrived in NYC to find checked luggage robbed of most valuables. laptop damaged.
46176,49177,@DeltaAssist can you alert my connecting gate C52 that I'll be arriving just before they close the door due to mechanical in RSW?
46181,49183,@VirginAmerica why not just cancel the flight and stop having people wait. there's no way any flights will land at SFO until Friday
46184,49187,@AlaskaAir they did. Friday 2pm is what they could offer...was hoping for some mad twitter skills :)
46191,49194,@JetBlue any detailed info on JBU672? Delay increasing on the board but no employees around. Think well make nyc tnght or staying in FLL?
46197,49201,. @AmericanAir and the theme of the day is waiting...waiting to board. waiting to take off. waiting to get off the plane #2HoursLate
46200,49204,So far @AlaskaAir flights to delay my business this year: 0/32. Delta? 2/3. Learned that lesson real quick.
46206,49210,"Thank the Lord @JetBlue has direct TV on their planes....don't have to miss ""American Horror Story""....it's the little things..."
46207,49211,@DeltaAssist 8:40?! I was supposed to leave at 4:00! Where is my dinner and why is this terminal so cold?! #2181 #1585
46209,49213,@DeltaAssist deicing at lga needs to improve. 25 minutes a plane is insane. They look like they are lost. Come on people!!!
46214,49218,@VirginAmerica I had to cancel a flight due to weather. Can you let me know if this has been confirmed?
46217,49222,Wait... @SouthwestAir departs early if the plane arrived early? Shouldnt they wait until regular departure time?
46221,49226,"Hey @SouthwestAir ""don't be sad. one out of four (on time) ain't bad"". _"
46222,49227,@DeltaAssist What are the chances are my 7:10am flight out of SFO will be cancelled tomorrow?
46223,49228,Stuck on Delay in Atlanta. @SouthwestAir doesn't control the weather. but it's always heartening that they work hard to fix what they can.
46231,49236,@united I hope you realize what a shitty airline you are
46233,49238,"Sad to say. but @JetBlue IT sucks. App can tell you of city change but not update your boarding pass. ""IT issue"" blamed. No kidding."
46247,49252,Flight delay out of sfo to seattle. Cmon now @AlaskaAir! Gotta get home tonight. My daughters bday is maana! #wecandothis!
46250,49255,@AmericanAir I'm on #2390 to #DTW but trapped trying to get off connecting flight. My bag stuck 15 rows back. Please don't leave w/o me!
46251,49256,@DeltaAssist hi! I'm trying to encode my flight details in the missing miles but won't go through #help #newbie #skymiles
46261,49266,@united How likely is it that tomorrow's 1264 to SFO will be cancelled?
46263,49268,@united flight 733 sfo-sea started gate checking at group 3 despite lots of room. This is bad management of 2-bag rule at its worst.
46268,49274,Hey @DeltaAssist I'm getting real tired of booking a seat only to find you switch the aircraft and throw me in a middle seat.
46272,49278,Stop playing with my emotions @AlaskaAir. Are we go or no go? #sfstorm http://t.co/yfrI1lz7fZ
46288,49295,Booked #Delta to #MDW. Not sure how I feel about Midway or Delta. The new @AmericanAir is way better IMO; but no flights to MDW! #upintheair
46293,49300,Turning off phone for takeoff. @VirginAmerica (who I really like) and I will be having a talk in the morning about tonight's mess ups!
46302,49310,@DeltaAssist if we have to entirely cancel a trip due to illness do we do a change fee even though we don't know when we'd travel again?
46304,49312,@united my husband is the one traveling on business. Since the case was lost &amp; then returned broken. he's not had a chance. Certainly will.
46314,49323,@DeltaAssist sorry I'm bleary eyed from waiting so long. It's DL2532 jfk to PDX
46317,49326,@VirginAmerica - I've just seen that my flight tomorrow from San Fran has been cancelled - what do I do?!
46326,49335,@united I sure did!!! Can't wait for the next flight!!
46340,49350,. @united just sent you a bunch of DMs about how upset I am with some issues.
46343,49354,How the heck am I going to get to Tennessee if @JetBlue doesn't fly there? #HelpMe :(
46347,49359,Received a tip from a source @SouthwestAir . All Flights from #Reno have been cancelled till 2:30 pm Thursday due to pending storm.
46349,49361,@JetBlue Do you expect trouble flying in to San Diego tmrw night? It's just rain but it's a lot of rain. Should I look to switch my flight?
46364,49376,Stuck at 99.923 @AmericanAir + US EQMs and have to wait another week to request a missing flight credit #SoClose #ExecPlat
46368,49382,Shoutout to @AlaskaAir for having my bro's flight delayed 3 hours -more time to watch MLBN reruns and wait for this alleged press conference
46370,49384,@AmericanAir give me the #executiveplatinum challenge and I'm there. 20+ yrs. 5as EP. broke foot and u kicked me out. That's a fail TOO! _

46388,49406,@JetBlue that makes no sense for your 6am flight passengers. We're all in a panic to not miss our planes and the line is crazy.
46391,49409,@AmericanAir the least y'all could do is upgrade your hold music if you're gonna make people wait this long. S
46393,49411,What a miserable flying experience with @united today. 1K status means nothing folks. They'll still be as frustrating as humanly possible.
46397,49416,@united any info about UA527 into SFO this morning? Flight status says it's ok but lots of other flights seem to be cancelled.
46402,49421,This woman is on the phone with @JetBlue upset with them bc she showed up late smh
46405,49424,@AmericanAir not sure what is happening with their systems and planes.  Had to change equipment yesterday and my return today was cancelled
46407,49426,hmmm @SouthwestAir has cancelled all flights out of Reno this morning....
46413,49432,Another great flight @JetBlue so easy I was asleep the entire time and missed my snack.
46417,49436,@AmericanAir you just delayed my flight for a non emergency reason and all you say is deal with it? I'll never fly with you again
46418,49437,@VirginAmerica Ross out of Seattle Gate B11 was amazing. Helped us get rebooked amidst chaos of delayed flights. Give him a raise!
46419,49438,Alas. I guess it says something when your plane looks like a dated set from Mad Men. Eyes at you @AlaskaAir
46420,49439,@JetBlue Is there a TrueBlue login issue? I can't login with my or my wife's logins
46422,49443,@SouthwestAir I did. Now it's just a waiting game.
46430,49451,@VirginAmerica Is the storm that bad or just taking precautions?
46433,49454,@DeltaAssist Hi from flight 481 now delayed over 90 minutes captain says it is due to first snow event at jfk come on now barely a dusting

46479,49504,@DeltaAssist Feel abused by Delta when I was stranded. Predatory rate. Cust Svc made worse. Sorry to say that I am now a former freq flyer
46483,49508,A little sad tomorrow's flight isn't with @VirginAmerica. This is what happens when someone else books my travel.
46485,49510,@DeltaAssist please don't leave my bag at LAX en route to HNL. Traffic wasn't my fault this morning. I can bribe you w/ cookies
46488,49513,@AmericanAir never known an airline to cancel its flight like yours.  BRITISH AIRWAYS all the way from now on
46490,49515,@AlaskaAir My elderly 77 yr old mother is stranded in PSG.She was returning from FAI to JNU.No meal or hotel voucher is unacceptable.
46497,49522,Some person just came up to me as I was reading my book at the gate &amp; tried to sell me an Alaska Airlines credit card. Bad form. @AlaskaAir.
46510,49535,Just got this email from @SouthwestAir apparently dance music has stolen the metal horns. Can't we keep ONE thing? http://t.co/b35wUJwvrN

46556,49584,@united passengers are expected to show up on time but its ok for your pilots to be in road traffic delaying our flights and-connections?
46567,49595,@JetBlue hates me. We told them I was going to come in last second for my flight to Vegas.  And the left 10 minutes early anyway.
46569,49597,@VirginAmerica-flying back on 1st trip w/ you. Do you match status from other airlines? Now that you're at DAL. I could switch from AA.
46570,49598,I hate when people save seats on @SouthwestAir flights.
46571,49600,@JetBlue Hey I've got a change in my travel plans :(. will it be easy to switch my flight from MCO to FLL and change the day as well?
46572,49602,I stray from @SouthwestAir for the first time in ages and now suffering consequences. I'll never do it again. Promise. #usairfail

46601,49634,@JetBlue should always have someone around. Everyone else is working. Lost my business.

46623,49733,So I pay $50 for a seat with extra leg room. TV not working. Guess I missed clicking that box when making my @JetBlue extras purchase
46626,49736,Well. on the PLUS side maybe the maint. issue on the @AlaskaAir flight means the wind will be done when we fly.
46629,49739,Heading home on the last flight of the year. It's @united so it's delayed. Natch.

46650,49761,Losing the will to live. @AmericanAir you have had a really. really bad day. Your tagline 'a new plane every week'. very appropriate.
46658,49770,Props to @SouthwestAir. Bit of a firm landing. That wasnt the captains fault. That wasnt the first officers fault. It was the asphalt

46820,49956,@JetBlue I love JetBlue and will always fly you.  Not a deal breaker.  But I hope someone is aware of what's going on with 199.
46823,49959,Crap! I'll be missing @JetBlue T5 holiday fun by one day. Kinda wish I flew back to BUF on 18th instead :(

46880,50020,@united I'm just really tired of delays without warning. Quite comfy in the lounge and would have preferred to stay there rather than wait
46882,50022,@AmericanAir the problem is. why must we battle? Look into. &amp; re-evaluate the policy. I'm sure your CEO is wearing a suit costing over $250.

47485,50666,@AlaskaAir My mom ordered a gluten free meal. so she received no meal. Dangerous for older woman on meds. FAIL AA

47511,50695,Reason I pick @VirginAmerica is for their entertainment. Wifi was down and my tv wasn't working. Sad face. http://t.co/GpdGULFHZ4
47515,50699,@SouthwestAir says we took off. but we are still in the hot crappy plane on the ground #nofastfoodonplanes #ontime? http://t.co/gpjwg13Zc0
47517,50701,@AlaskaAir hey! Who can I email with regards to the terrible guest services I just dealt with on flight 613 to seattle?
47526,50711,@SouthwestAir I'm pissed off because I was in a car accident in June and I missed my flights to SF and you guys refused to give me the
47531,50718,All the screens on this @united flight turned on to play ads mid-flight. It was VERY annoying.
47534,50721,By the way @JetBlue has the best hot towels and wifi I've ever had. Oh wait. they're the only airline I've had this experience at. 
47535,50722,@united 5648 cancelled (at the last minute) BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO CREW??? Seriously? No more flights today. kids waiting. I hate you.
47543,50730,Not a first class upgrade but no one in the middle is not a bad way to end my last year being #mvpgold. Thanks for arranging @AlaskaAir! 
47544,50731,When you have bad enough service where ppl are literally making videos about it. crying. then something's wrong @jetblue #ByeRegina87346
47551,50739,Idek what happened but so many people have missing luggage from this @AlaskaAir flight! Including my newlywed cousins on their honeymoon! __
47556,50745,Yikes. This @JetBlue flight to RDU smells like a baby had a very bad day. Gross.
47561,50750,@united no one likes them. but you are used to have it. use problem solving tools to be better!
47567,50756,@DeltaAssist I'm on a mobile device. I'll try from a PC... Is there any issue with me booking from Australia?
47582,50774,@united why no Premier Access is open at EWR this morning? Very poor check in and security process.
47583,50775,Yo @SouthwestAir is like Soul Plane. no lie!!
47586,50778,@JetBlue all were great! Made up for #tsa checkin process. THAT was a mess.
47591,50784,@united Found 1 letter typo in middle name on reservation-Will I have issue boarding w/ ID+passport tomorrow? Can it be noted under my name?
47594,50788,Never using an airplane lavatory again now that @SouthwestAir has informed us there are video cameras in there...  How is that legal?!
47605,50800,@DeltaAssist Have One On Us gone?? Seriously? You hate your SKY members don't you?
47606,50801,@AlaskaAir Just found out my Alaska Air flight is switched to American. and my seat selection is gone. 2nd time in a row = #LastTime
47609,50804,"@VirginAmerica it is too fucking early for ""call me maybe"""

47612,50807,I would never fly with @AmericanAir tbh
47614,50809,Love you. @VirginAmerica . but the Robot Rap/ safety song are the absolute worst!
47623,50820,Hi @SouthwestAir. premium Wifi on a flight I'm currently on is agonizingly slow. yet live (free) Dish streaming is blazing fast. What gives?
47625,50822,@SouthwestAir if I cancel my flight home for Xmas. is the only option a credit for future tickets? No refund policy?
47626,50823,@AmericanAir #336 late.  we've waited 1hr for de-ice.  everyone knew this plane was supposed to depart at 9 am.  plan ahead.
47632,50829,@united ya'll fucked up my seat number. #ihateaisleseats

47643,50840,@JetBlue lol y'all suck.
47655,50852,I love you. @AlaskaAir. but a maint. delay outbound and a crew not cleared to fly inbound... and now. I'm missing the holiday party. :(
47660,50857,Halfway through booking. click buy after putting in credit card info. and @SouthwestAir raises the price. Bait and switch?  I think so.
47676,50874,There is no other industry other than #air #travel where it's completely okay to be late every single time.  I'm talking about you @united.
47685,50883,@AmericanAir Been a loyal AA flyer for years but was VERY disappointed w/my flights these past two Friday's. Looks like I may need to switch
47688,50886,I'm trying to leave Chicago but @united thinks I should spend more time in O'Hare. #delayed

47720,50918,@AmericanAir leaving late again as we stand waiting to board LATE. Changed my ticket to earlier flight to leave on time. I should have known
47729,50927,@AmericanAir anyway you guys could hold flt 1550 out of ORD at 330pm for a few (15) minutes? Currently on US Air 1994. we left late.
47731,50929,@JetBlue There were separate lines. The issue was who was in the #TSApre line. Not a #JetBlue issue.
47733,50931,@JetBlue Spoke w/ lovely mosaic rep;confusion/frustration lies with me. I used my points to book flight for my husband. Cost $100 to cancel?
47734,50932,@united it's ridiculous that we have to wait and can't get a seat that we paid for on our flight. When we have an interview tomorrow....
47737,50936,Safe back home. Always a pleasure to fly with @JetBlue . Can't wait to the nect trip! http://t.co/s6DnD7VwL7
47739,50938,If I had to rate @United on a scale from 1 to 5. with 5 being the best. I'd be upset at having to give them 1 star: they haven't earned it.
47741,50940,Aruba bound Thursday for our honeymoon! Couldn't get seats next to each other. hoping someone will switch with us @JetBlue
47747,50946,Missed flights cancelled flights @SouthwestAir always knows how to make it all better

47773,50976,I guess I will keep tweeting.  @united LAX to EWR now set to leave at 245.  It's 238 and haven't started boarding
47784,50987,@united Hello folks! Connecting from 3900 to 4705 in PVD tonight and we are running late. can u notify gate 8 to keep the door open for me?

47867,51076,@SouthwestAir flight 3322 from Vegas to San is on its 3rd gate switch. No end in sight.
47868,51077,"@AmericanAir no luck? ""Overloaded oxygen"" and ""waiting for service man but it's shift change"" is the word from crew. Seamless operation..."
47869,51078,Traveling with @united has reminded me that mega airlines unapologetically rob you of time that you'll never get back.
47875,51085,Gets better. @AmericanAir Customer Relations does NOT offer their customer a phone number to call. Must email &amp; wait for reply. (2)
47900,51111,@SouthwestAir no they diverted our plane to others who were waiting. You diverted our flight to appease others with no concern to others
47901,51112,Airport waiting game part 2 @SouthwestAir
47912,51124,@united wants to put passengers back on a broken plane to fly from Dulles to Reagan. Not sure why shuttling is not an option
47925,51138,Ok. @americanair. what's the point of getting us to the airport early if we have to wait on the tarmac for our alloted gate to open?
47926,51139,@DeltaAssist you're the only airline I can stand. and I'm having a big issue with you today. Please don't make me hate you guys too!

48045,51264,@AmericanAir I'm a million miler. but I've gotta say the new bonus miles program that only benefits Bus/1st class cabins is ridiculous

48110,51335,So. @JetBlue doesn't  think a fever and infection are a valid reason to cancel a flight.  I'm sure my fellow passengers would disagree.
48115,51345,@AmericanAir I was on flight  1090 out of Orange County Ca and going to DFW sorry for the late response.
48159,51396,@AmericanAir is killing me. Com'on guys. don't cancel a flight that clearly has tons of people on it. Ain't nobody got time for that.

48450,51705,That moment you realize the @VirginAmerica safety video song is stuck in your head...#welldone

48464,51719,@SouthwestAir Flight 455 is delayed because you let someone without a ticket on the plane. I sure hope you're holding connecting flights.

48474,51729,I used to only fly LAX/BOS with @JetBlue because I thought they were so kind. Extremely disappointed with their customer service today.
48492,51748,Just landed at #LGA.  There musta been over 10 people in wheelchairs awaiting the @JetBlue flight to Ft Lauderdale.  #Stereotype #Sunbirds
48494,51750,@JetBlue yesterday in the flight 1843 MCO-BOG you damaged my luggage. it was a guitar and even saying that it was fragile you affected it.
48501,51757,yup @SouthwestAir i'm missing my connecting flight to #LosAngeles
48505,51762,So. if you fly @SouthwestAir and cancel your flight. those funds expire a year from when you bought the ticket. Done with that airline.
48507,51764,@AmericanAir so frustrated with the airline I always choose!!!! On military orders and I'm having to jump through hoops to cancel my flight!
48514,51771,Don't bother with the subtitles-this @JetBlue short film will speak to anyone who has traveled to see a family member http://t.co/gJrKeEQWWA
48515,51773,American Airlines sends me an email telling me I can check in. but the link tells me there's a problem. This is why I fly @SouthwestAir
48516,51774,Sheba's in London now. waiting for the baggage office to open. Let's hope her bags are there like @united told her. #findshebasbags
48518,51776,@SouthwestAir disappointed in your inflexibility today. Not letting us leave bwi on an earlier (non-full) flight to bna...

48523,51782,@AlaskaAir Cannot log into my trips. Are you experiencing problems? Thanks
48531,51791,@SouthwestAir There have been a lot of complaints about flight 905 in Dallas on Sunday. Are we getting compensated for the inconvenience?

48541,51803,Flight cancelled? @united I will need to be compensated for missing both of my jobs tomorrow. #thankyou

48901,52185,@DeltaAssist Hi. I fly the Shuttle 2-3x per month out of LGA. Still  Delta but the switch to Term C has no upside. Avg 20 mins more.

48918,52203,This poor @united chap's not gotten very far. Anyone know what's going on here? #avgeek http://t.co/fxWdvCyRy5

49365,52692,@AlaskaAir But will we get a vegan option in First??? Vice meat sandwich or starve?
49366,52693,Well our first @AlaskaAir flight got delayed for no apparent reason so we missed our connection by minutes...Luckily there is a later flight
49368,52695,@united I say this only because my last three or four trips with you has been hell.
49369,52697,Hey @AlaskaAir skip Juneau and send us from Sitka to Anchorage! Or at least cancel the flight and quit dragging this out!
49371,52699,@united bad start but getting better. This txt at arraival made things much more comfortable http://t.co/pgM27RCcb2
49376,52704,@united can't believe after yesterday you've left us waiting this long with no info because first coach filled up.
49379,52707,Check-in for @united is torturous. I have never seen a check-in line move so slowly. #neveragain
49384,52712,@VirginAmerica haven't flown u guys in yrs due 2 circumstances nd miss it so much because even thn you were the future. Congrats on success!
49405,52733,@DeltaAssist a crew issue means that a flight that was supposed to get in at 3pm now gets in during the middle of the night?
49407,52735,Boston -maui booked @AlaskaAir   Can't wait aloha baby
49425,52755,@AmericanAir apparently my 1st class tkt is really a coach tkt W/ upgrade meaning no flight change toady. Misleading #customerservicefail
49427,52757,@SouthwestAir WHATEVER!!! Sorry is NOT enough. u r destroying my vacation that I have saved a LONG time for. I NEED my bags NOW!! #nightmare
49429,52759,@SouthwestAir  don't leave me! Been at security line for 45 min! #oak
49430,52760,@JetBlue Whoa. Departed early w/o me? Not cool.
49438,52768,.@SouthwestAir you have made this day miserable.
49440,52770,@united How about flatscreens not working in the ENTIRE airplane? Transatlantic flight UA958 Chicago to London was a disaster. guys.
49446,52776,@AmericanAir stuck on another old cramped uncomfortable plane.  Lol...again.
49451,52781,@united Don't miss my Bali. Indonesia http://t.co/UKpHVJGaiU Damn it's BALI  visit us &gt;&gt; http://t.co/eivxhglIsA
49455,52785,@AmericanAir After a planeful of missed connections.  The embarrassed pilot says it all.
49464,52794,@AlaskaAir put all 4 of my family in middle seats. For the sake of my kids I hope they can fix the problem before today's flight.
49465,52795,@AmericanAir i need a phone number for help with my damage http://t.co/brv0QeoTg3
49470,52800,Came early to SFO only to deal with @united's awful check in process. Currently in 15+ min wait to get baggage tag.
49494,52825,It's not @united fault their plane had a fault. What is their fault is the way they treat their customers. Make Ryanair look like the Ritz.
49499,52831,@JetBlue: your year in review email just made my morning. Can't wait to fly with you next week to SAV and San Diego in March! #partofthefam
49501,52834,@AmericanAir Still waiting... I've received NUMEROUS promo emails but ZERO response to this issue. http://t.co/GKC26c2GWG
49512,52846,Was stuck behind this in traffic today! It's like @united knows about my #RTWsoon. That's the flight I'm taking. _ http://t.co/FoRUrALK4n
49525,52860,@DeltaAssist Anyway I can miss the first leg of a trip? Want to see my newborn twin niece and nephew!
49530,52865,@AmericanAir Not long until your taking us to the BIG APPLE!!! Can't wait!
49532,52867,can't wait to take these @SouthwestAir flights to Havana on the regular
49537,52872,Very unpleasant interaction with a @SouthwestAir flight crew today. Was not the only passenger. either. Always catches you off guard.
49545,52882,Sigh second mechanical delay in December but thankfully no connection to run to! @JetBlue 1373 to Charleston http://t.co/7GGx3OBvR7
49546,52883,@AmericanAir today Thursday Dec 18. 2014 4:55pm local time (Brazil). I wanted to have it registered my FRUSTRATION with the POOR service..
49556,52893,Hi @AlaskaAir Im getting an error trying to get into my order on your website. it fails for the last 30 minutes. cannot print my tickets :(
49568,52905,Last flight as a @united platinum for a while. Too bad exceeding 1k qualifying PQD this year didn't outweigh my lack of PQM/PQS
49571,52908,@united No. there wasn't a problem with my reservation. just your understaffing.
49574,52911,@AlaskaAir Beyond is the perfect airline entertainment! Don't deal with crappy airline devices. watch latest movies on your iPad!
49586,52925,@JetBlue you have no integrity. You made us miss international flts and won't put on nxt flt due to $$$..your errors your liability!!
49603,52945,@united may I complaint about why you dont sell half bot of wine to Asian?
49608,52950,Really @AmericanAir. these are the 'upgraded' sandwiches in F? Looks like the same crAAp to me. Disgusting! http://t.co/YQRgWZq9PU
49618,52960,Can't wait till I see my Self @United Arab Emirates.....dubai on my mind InshaAllah
49620,52962,@SouthwestAir it's only getting worse... http://t.co/2w1DBOvSsr
49624,52966,@SouthwestAir let's fucking go wheels up I'm going to miss my next flight
49630,52974,@SouthwestAir after 45 minutes on hold. I sent an email instead. I couldn't handle the music anymore! hopefully this works out ok!
49644,52990,A little late. but shoutout to @SouthwestAir for the #LUVvoucher to compensate for our unexpected diversion on Tuesday! Now THAT's service!
49647,52993,@JetBlue no apologies from the crew or ground staff. 1/4 of plane boarded after final boarding call. Bad esp for holidays. No apology?
49651,52997,@DeltaAssist Hey there - looking to cancel a reservation. Can you help me with this?
49655,53001,No on-board WIFI on my flight back to Europe (with @united). Too bad.   Also: productivity time!
49658,53005,Maybe @AmericanAir should announce a LIT-LGA direct flight with less fanfare if they're going to cancel it a year later.
49672,53019,@DeltaAssist how about a travel voucher for STILL BEING IN DETROIT. Of all the places to get stuck. nobody wants to get stuck in Detroit
49677,53024,The only thing that isn't stressful about this trip is @SouthwestAir. Their itinerary change policies are literally a gift from the gods.
49696,53045,@AlaskaAir so much for perfect track record. Been stuck at the gate for over an hour. Sigh...
49708,53058,6 segments and 5180 miles short of re-upping my @AlaskaAir MVP Gold status for next year. Grrrrr.
49713,53063,@AmericanAir Too bad the planes are almost the same inside as they are in the movie in 1990.
49716,53067,@SouthwestAir last month you broke my professionally packed bike twice and didn't care now this to a METAL tag... http://t.co/iPRQ13sIWK
49718,53069,@AmericanAir ignoring complaints about AA42 on 12/17 ORD---&gt;CDG. Mechanical issues. plane too old for transatlantic flights!
49721,53072,@AmericanAir what's the excuse today?? You guys are horrible! http://t.co/So8OarnhEb
49722,53073,Hi. @united? Yes. I need to cancel a reservation to Quito.
49732,53084,Crazy that @united needs to stop at BNA to refuel a IAD-DFW direct flight - waste of time. Try using  bigger planes with better range!
49751,53105,Time to go @AmericanAir ! I have smells to smell and things to mark http://t.co/uH1J0H3lRS
49753,53107,Stuck in Puerto Rico....@AmericanAir new planes please!
49764,53120,AUS&gt;&lt;JFK @JetBlue flights have been running late ever since they changed the schedule earlier this year to run earlier in am &amp; later in pm
49768,53124,Can't wait for my complementary drink!!!! @SouthwestAir
49769,53125,Why do you always have to be late out of #BurbankAirport. @SouthwestAir? This is the second time this week.
49782,53138,@AmericanAir is it common to have to wait over a week to receive a follow-up on a customer relations complaint?
49786,53142,Today @AmericanAir had an aircraft issue. Stuck in Chicago til 12am &amp; missing our 1st Bangkok tour. Disappointing start to our honeymoon.
49793,53149,So thankful for @SouthwestAir waiting for us delayed passengers. I didn't not want to sleep in Chicago tonight!
49794,53150,Oh come on. @AmericanAir! A 20- min wait for a gate at ORD? Merry Xmas to you too...
49795,53151,Live TVs on @JetBlue are not working #notMadJustDisappointed
49802,53159,@AmericanAir hi! stuck in sfo. need to be back for a work emergency. flight cancel cos of time out.  HELP!
49803,53161,@united UA1622 delayed due to need to de-ice? It's Chicago. in winter. of course the plane needs to de-ice!! #planbetter
49816,53174,@united maybe you guys should make sure the planes fucking work before you schedule them for flights
49822,53182,@AmericanAir not as disappointed as me. I can assure you. I'm rebooked tomorrow evening. but frankly. this is all very poorly handled
49826,53186,Never thought I would say this. but I'm so disappointed in @SouthwestAir
49835,53195,@SouthwestAir I'm flying out tomorrow can I bring my mechanical mod in my carry on!?
49838,53198,@JetBlue Your DCA check in and gate crew was AWESOME tonight. They're the only reason I didn't miss my flight and were happy to help!
49848,53208,@AmericanAir no they won't. They told me to wait around and it might come up. It's here. they just won't get it for me.
49849,53209,@united airlines please wait for me! I'm suppose to be on the 9:45 flight to NYC and I'm stuck in the airport carousel. Guys please rt!!!
49854,53214,@SouthwestAir is always delaying my flights _
49864,53226,@DeltaAssist they told me it was a problem on your end and I needed to contact you.
49874,53236,@AmericanAir we are stuck WAITING for a 9:25pm flight delayed out of ORD to SAN and NOW we have to wait for a new crew??! It's 11:34pm!
49880,53242,Why are you so bad at planning? @united
49885,53247,still waiting for UA to fly 787-9 to SFO regularly...come on @united
49888,53250,Love it when @JetBlue's flights get repeatedly delayed over 4 hours and then changed AS IM IN LINE TO BOARD to a different city. I LOVE IT
49900,53262,@JetBlue great BOS&gt;sea flt 497 w v early arrival til we had to wait 1 hr for gate &amp; luggage came in totally SOAKED:( http://t.co/SJzvw73ZDU
49907,53270,Thanks @jetblue SOC for a productive late night pocket session tonight!! Awesome participation and great questions!! http://t.co/ENohtAbVzQ
49911,53274,I hate @SouthwestAir. Had so many problems with them 
49912,53276,@united I was on flight 1629. I don't mind be diverted. I DO mind waiting over 30 mins for luggage. Always like this in Houston. What gives?
49915,53279,@AmericanAir too late. I am at the airport waiting. But I gave my mobile number when booking..
49917,53281,Merry Christmas from @united.... #fail http://t.co/EhW2P0Vf2f
49919,53283,@DeltaAssist currently in the Madrid Airport the Vip lounge no longer will accept platinum or delta Amex to enter. Must be Business Class:(
49921,53285,Oh there's no place like Home for the holidays.. __ #TrueBlue member flying with @JetBlue . #Jersey bound ____ can't wait to see family
49936,53300,I kinda feel bad that I sat in the first row on this @SouthwestAir flight I don't need the extra space but this seat is comfy
49940,53305,@DeltaAssist my hotel in Monterrey is saying that the local airport has no flights coming or going? Should I be worried?
49956,53321,Last trip of the year. and @united can't hold it together. How can they have the wrong tail number? #unfriendlyskies #worstairline
49960,53325,*sigh* miss you @virginamerica as I wait to get off a US Airways flight. #LAXtoPHL http://t.co/KkSWCryzHq http://t.co/CQKV6ZlDao
49969,53335,@AmericanAir I switched from UA and generally happier but your policy on same day changes when missing flights is poor in comparison!
49980,53346,SCREW @AmericanAir YOU ASSHOLES
49984,53351,Apparently paying for a flight doesn't guarantee they'll provide a plane! I usually love @VirginAmerica but you're killing me. #laxorbust
49985,53352,@AmericanAir If I depart at 5:50 from LAX. but change planes in DFW. I have to wait until 24 before my Dallas fight to check in?
50001,53368,@AmericanAir a little snow before leave EGE http://t.co/SFskz7fXff
50002,53369,Don't leave your bags unattended unless you're flying @SouthwestAir. then just leave them here on the floor. http://t.co/OkOiIXLSbo
50015,53382,@DeltaAssist Delta 1972 long delay. Stuck in Austin. Need to get to NYC. Need ideas.
50018,53386,@united flying out of vail eagle Monday.  They are expecting feet of snow.  when can we re route through den to avoid getting stuck
50019,53387,Frustrating error page on @AmericanAir webpage after 15 minutes entering data to check-in. http://t.co/rMvL8klmP5
50023,53391,"just feel like ""I'll be home for Christmas"" is a cruel thing 4 @AmericanAir to be playing in a terminal where every1 is missing their flight"
50025,53393,@americanair why do you have a flight sale and then not say the dates the price is valid? Having to hunt through dates is so frustrating
50032,53400,@united I just checked in and you guys have separated me and my partner. Now he's stuck in a middle seat for no reason.
50039,53407,@united bringing 2 pets from SFO to dsm and the process could not be worse.   Stand in 2 lines for their tix. #1K http://t.co/sx5HMnExyY
50046,53414,Never flying @AmericanAir again. I'm convinced the plane was from 1975. it smelled like old bacon. &amp; they lost my bag _______
50050,53418,@AlaskaAir No worries. AK Air is the best airline &amp; has the best staff. 25+ yrs biz travel never had pilot go 2 gate 2 give news.
50058,53426,"@united my flight to SFO was cancelled due to ""air traffic control"" but the flight to LAX isn't..what's going on exactly ?"
50060,53428,@JetBlue I am traveling with you over the holidays -- when is the free checked bag courtesy no longer in effect?
50065,53433,"Now that they've made the so-subtle #branding change. I can't not see where @AlaskaAir 's ""k"" is and isn't kicking the little ""a"""
50066,53434,We are ready to leave on our Christmas trip. Just waiting to board our @JetBlue flight to Tampa #JetBlueFamily. http://t.co/NS1GrKakGN
50081,53449,What the hell why did @JetBlue up their #mint tickets..... $829???? #jetblue
50086,53454,This is a first. Board @united flight to Toronto. Everybody is on. Oh. No flight crew. Everybody get off.
50089,53457,Hey @SouthwestAir - any suggestions for finding a missing bag? My husband and I are in Boston. His bag. however. is not. #brrrr
50097,53465,Here are 12 US airlines ranked by how often they lose your baggage. @VirginAmerica is the best! Envoy's the worst. http://t.co/mNFPcO2I6a
50101,53469,"Looks like @americanair has some issues with respecting their elite fliers. Maybe a little more ""training"" of managers is needed?"
50104,53472,My flight has been delayed by 3 hours so @VirginAmerica set up a basketball hoop for us so we can #BallWhileWeWait http://t.co/t6nOyKdrQn
50109,53477,Big news everyone: the cruising altitude on my @SouthwestAir flight today will be 39.000 ft. Can't wait to tell my grandchildren about this.
50120,53488,Never again flying @united! I know I always say this but this time I'm done. Been stuck at an airport for over 12 hours
50121,53489,Kinda of frustrating when flights gets way cheaper AFTER you buy them @AlaskaAir :(
50122,53491,@jetblue would benefit from an economics lesson. #customerexperience also very poor. #airline #travel #holidays #businessrules
50131,53500,really glad im an advantage member and @AmericanAir lost my suitcase with EVERYTHING in it.....
50133,53502,@united Is there a problem posting miles from MESA? Boarding pass has numbers. but no flight credit.  Need it to reach elite tier
50138,53507,Oh you know. just a bit delayed with @JetBlue...
50145,53514,@AmericanAir why does flight 1047 ORD to LAX stop after Jan 5th? Will have to switch airlines if 8am is the new earliest time.
50161,53530,@DeltaAssist It looks like he's going to be stuck overnight at the airport. I don't know what tweeting at you will do. What's your plan?
50168,53537,BOOO! THUMBS DOWN TO @JetBlue to add bag fees and extra seats to boost profit http://t.co/tpfsJxGtS6  this is bad move. No longer MY airline
50169,53538,@united Been more 2yrs never had such a bad exper. till last travel. International flight seat recline malfunction button damage &amp; bag delay
50177,53546,@JetBlue I am not happy with the Unaccompanied Minor Services. Flight 1706 Dic 18 Record Locator PFOVHJ. Won't use this services agian
50178,53547,@AmericanAir how do you frustrate me. let me count the ways.  Your flights are late. you close your doors 10 mins early.  When do you think?
50179,53548,@AmericanAir the pup and I are looking forward to our flight to Dallas tomorrow for the holidays &amp; anxiously awaiting upgrade clear email!
50185,53554,On day 2-3 waiting for a reply from @United - Not sure this is better than waiting on hold forever on the phone.
50198,53569,I'm probably going to lose my job because I can't afford to switch the date of my flight thanks to @JetBlue
50201,53573,@AmericanAir taking advantage of our delayed EGE-MIA flight for an impromptu photo shoot rather than updating pax? http://t.co/0oTX4RWN6R
50206,53578,@DeltaAssist but rather then say for x amount of dollars we can sell you a seat you tell people there are no flights. that kinda sucks
50214,53586,A bit of a bumpy flight out of DC to Dallas.  A little wait until my next one.  @AmericanAir #travel #dinosaur #douglasthedinosaur
50220,53593,My flight would be delayed. Awesome job @JetBlue 
50228,53601,Dont cancel my flight then try to socialize with me @united #IShowedThem http://t.co/QbqAcADNsz
50230,53604,@DeltaAssist either improve on-time record of regional flights or find other options. Late inbound plane has delayed LGA-ORF significantly!
50234,53608,@united I have been on the phone for more than 30 mins trying to buy a fligh for the price on my computer. Gold status is clearly worthless
50235,53609,Props to SFO @VirginAmerica gate staff who just rebooked me straight to NYC instead of making me take a sure to be missed connection via LAX
50236,53610,Should have bought my tickets last night but now they just raised the price again. Double sigh. @SouthwestAir
50238,53612,@AlaskaAir Thanks for not boarding us the same way as the first time we had to board the first time. #delayed flight 500.
50239,53613,@JetBlue both of our TVs are not working on our flight to Orlando....this should be fun #ridiculous #jetblue #notv http://t.co/IbPrRLn5HB

50257,53632,If you're flying @united I feel bad for you. son. You'll have 99 problems.. No. that's it. #fb
50258,53633,I'm not going to lie... watching the video of that @AmericanAir flight hit massive turbulence above Japan scared the crap out of me!!!
50266,53642,Rocking these beauties to my last final. It may be miserable. but at least I'll be comfortable. @AmericanAir http://t.co/aFMQB1NxwD
50275,53651,@united Never again. I booked a flight in Nov for my travel home from school. Thinking that I would have to (cont) http://t.co/TQ9dBqZf3F

50287,53665,As always. flight delayed. Thanks @JetBlue .
50309,53689,@united normal handling doesn't rip off handles. I watched your people launching bags today.
50310,53690,@AmericanAir  very bad delay today flight 2870 Was this mechanical?
50311,53691,@united you should also stop saying things should happen at this time or that time because it's always a lie.
50315,53695,Why am I not surprised my @united flight has incurred an additional delay. The thing is only coming from LAS to SFO.
50323,53703,@AlaskaAir Yup. Awesome agent Dana helped me. props to her. Between rebooking and itinerary getting updated the new flight delayed.
50329,53709,@JetBlue your app thinks B6 1407 departs JFK at 640.  We both know that's wrong.  Late. Bad info.  I'd be interested in WHY the late flt
50337,53717,Another delay. Can't @AmericanAir  maintain their fleet. Many missed connections in our future!
50340,53720,@SouthwestAir has some serious work to do logistically...always late with their flights

50348,53728,@united can the men's restroom in the United Club terminal C smell any worse 24/7 everyday?  #getafabreeze
50349,53729,@VirginAmerica why is flight 193 to SFO delayed 4 hrs with other flights taking off for SFO?
50350,53730,On @JetBlue flight 255. Everyone's TV works except mine. 1st world problem BUT I chose jetblue bc of the TV. Nice.
50355,53736,this A/B/C southwest shit show right here is why I always prefer flying @VirginAmerica
50362,53743,This terminal is weird. I miss @JetBlue. #homewardbound
50365,53746,.@SouthwestAir remember when you kicked the guy from Green Day off a plane because his pants were sagging
50367,53749,@SouthwestAir why is flight #1801 from las to oak delayed?
50370,53753,@SouthwestAir poor performance today
50377,53760,@SouthwestAir This flt. is always late due to waiting for connecting passengers. Last flt. into STL so 150 wait for 10 passengers. Fix this!
50394,53777,Thank you Harvey at @VirginAmerica LAX. Flight's delayed but you saved the day. Would have missed the holiday party without you.
50416,53802,You are just worthless @united

50442,53829,@SouthwestAir little brother is on delayed 377 to BWI. trying to make 186 to ALB &amp; looks like cutting it close. Will he make it?
50445,53832,@united what's the deal with the delay on flt 1171 getting into the arriving gate? Lots of us have connecting flts w shirt connections

50478,53869,@VirginAmerica lounge at LAX Really bad.
50479,53870,@AmericanAir does my son needs to wait 20 years for you to find his suitcase?
50481,53872,@VirginAmerica Thanks for the follow.  Can't wait to see you guys in a few weeks en route to #CES2015
50482,53873,Hey @united if you had a functioning nutsack I would drop everything important in my life to try to cut them off. Then I'd kill your family
50483,53874,@AlaskaAir It's OK. I'm just exhausted as I flew to LAX early this AM and now flt to YVR is very late.
50494,53885,Only an airline like @united can have 2 flights back to back delayed at the same for contract cleaning/security sweep.
50496,53887,@AmericanAir 3037. still haven't pulled away. very poor planning
50497,53888,@AmericanAir I have a booking thats been on request for a while now. can you tell me how long its going to take to confirm or cancel?
50506,53897,hi @united you make grown men cry and ruin babies' Christmases
50509,53900,Flying: CIA sanctioned torture method of slowly crushing your balls. But at least I can charge my phone. Thx @VirginAmerica !
50519,53911,To Kevin @SouthwestAir I'm sure you're having a long day but it's no excuse to treat your customers with contempt or threaten them.
50524,53916,@AmericanAir Lost a paid gig. time &amp; a driver waiting for me at the airport for said gig. Looking to be made whole.
50525,53917,@united what happened tonight here at BOI? 45 min and still waiting for luggage. Didn't you realize your planes were full? #poorplanning
50530,53922,@AlaskaAir stop delaying this flight out of seattle! Some of us are anxious to get home.
50540,53932,@VirginAmerica doesn't fly from Dallas to Chicago? Sad face. Guess I'll cross them off the list. :(
50555,53947,Never taking @AmericanAir from LAX to SAN again. Could have walked faster
50561,53953,Hey @united how goes it? Just thought I'd say hi while we wait for an eternity for our bags at ewr tonight.
50563,53955,Over 40 min taxi before takeoff flight was supposed to leave at 9:40 pm @JetBlue still on the runway

50587,53980,@AmericanAir what's up with aa272 12/19? Any chance it will leave before 1:30am?
50593,53986,#AOG @AlaskaAir and will miss the bowl game. Thank you.

50628,54021,@united it's too late
50633,54026,I love when flights get cancel thanks @JetBlue
50652,54046,@united  I'm disappointed today in your not so prompt departure. All because a crew overslept! #UnitedExpress UA4166 http://t.co/mjhRwdQjQ7
50656,54050,Cutest thing..@SouthwestAir waiting 4 flight n a dad gets off plane with a puppy for his boys for Christmas. Their faces were priceless 
50664,54058,"Just had an amazing @JetBlue experience. Jfk is insane so I try to pay for their ""skip the line"" option. But it doesn't work."
50679,54073,So @United completely lost my brother's bags (coming from Oslo) and mine were grabbed by TSA (coming from SFO). Festive!
50680,54074,@VirginAmerica spoiled me. I'm mad that they no longer fly to DFW
50696,54090,@united Waiting to talk to someone...been 15 minutes. Suggestions on an easier route?  Know it's a bust season but....
50699,54093,@JetBlue your new partner!!! Can't wait to fly with them too!!! http://t.co/CgcN91FA2U
50704,54099,The security line at the @JetBlue terminal at JFK is insane. 45 minute wait and I almost missed my flight.
50705,54100,@AmericanAir 50% of the time I have to switch terminals at DFW. I can deal with gates but there terminal link is a hassle!
50715,54112,When your delay is longer than your flight. Be better. @VirginAmerica. #GetMeHome
50718,54115,I've come full circle. On a @VirginAmerica flight to LA one year later. This time I did not miss! #thankstimehop http://t.co/RcfwvRF7f6
50719,54116,@AmericanAir yup missed it
50722,54119,@DeltaAssist I know I'm only silver status but 23 minutes on hold to change a reservation?
50729,54126,@united look at the page. Humberside police are murderer's. its disgusting what's happening to this guy. on Facebook
50730,54127,@JetBlue look at the page. Humberside police are murderer's. its disgusting what's happening to this guy. on Facebook.
50732,54129,@americanair So your policy is. the passengers need to board the plane first then switch seats. If not. you'll give it to an AA employee?
50734,54131,Now it's delayed so i need to sit in this plane for 1h until we can take off @AmericanAir step up your game
50738,54135,@JetBlue Ruined my travel plans out of Boston two years in a row. Always a nightmare. Never attempting to fly with you again.
50744,54142,Flying on @SouthwestAir out of #dca today? Leave now!! Check in is a disaster. And you can't check in babies curbside. #TheMoreYouKnow
50745,54143,@united beware paying first class tickets: new premiere feature for $50 merges 1000s of people into 1st class lines. 2 hr wait. Disgusted!
50753,54151,@united. Okay. listen: This has become more than inconvenient. Please contact me with info or to reach a resolution. http://t.co/4MSuUOcFAu
50755,54154,@AmericanAir bad bad in Miami! http://t.co/SzhrmjypOK
50764,54163,@JetBlue want to tell me why 689 to Regan is delayed so much today?
50770,54169,@DeltaAssist I'm sure not. nothing your sky miles team members would do for me already wasted 40min of my Saturday
50773,54173,@AlaskaAir Is the real MVP for their new seats having an international outlet/USB port on every single one. *Queue slow clap* _
50775,54175,@AmericanAir Truly BAD form! 1 mo/6 legs/3 diff days: 3 cancel/3 late. Today #2210 cancel; will miss connect. Again excuses no explanation.
50777,54177,Best trip! Until @JetBlue check in. of course. THEN asked us to pay for the solution to their problem. Seriously? Seriously. #onlyjetblue
50787,54187,@DeltaAssist redcoat asked what the problem was after I say down and he laughed about it
50792,54192,thanks @AlaskaAir &amp; TW Carrol for repairing my damaged bag.  #goodasnew #fingerscrossed
50797,54197,Thanks @VirginAmerica for letting me switch to an earlier flight at no charge! More family time in NYC!

50805,54205,I may never live to see the day an @AmericanAir flight leaves on time.
50812,54213,@united Filed a report at EWR and got it back late last night. but the handling has to get better. Especially for elites. 2x in 1 week..._
50813,54214,@united where is mine and everyone elses bad from flight UA 81. Newark to Manchester. My reference number is 8132940. Please i need my bags!

50845,54247,Can't wait to fly with @united on Monday! #Pumped
50848,54250,@AlaskaAir Security was a breeze this morning.  But the line for  baggage drop?   That was insane!
50851,54253,@SouthwestAir any news on flight 357? BWI to MHT? Why delayed?
50853,54256,@AlaskaAir my buddy's been waiting for his bag for over 20 mins. What's the deal?
50859,54262,@JetBlue waited an hour to check in and no sign no employee and im the bad guy for being upset! Not flying them again.
50867,54270,Stuck in El Paso is really boring... Rescue us @SouthwestAir  #flightcanceled

50875,54278,Big thank you to the @AlaskaAir ground crew in Lewiston. Id. After my flight got cancelled they bought the passengers pizza. Pop. and snacks
50881,54284,Missed not 1 but 2 flights due to numerous mess ups by the idiots at @AmericanAir amazed at their stupidity #thanksfornothing #holidayruined
50882,54285,@united y'all fucked me yesterday and I missed a flight I'm flying southwest from now on done with your shit
50890,54293,@SouthwestAir SFO lines verrrrry long. any chance more agents can help check in? Folks will likely miss flights 
50896,54300,Their flt was cancelled &amp; they're stuck in Austin. I'm resorting to bribery to get them here in time. @SouthwestAir http://t.co/FTCuZXzdpw
50899,54303,So f'ing pissed @AmericanAir! Kid's supposed to come home from Costa Rica tonight. Flight out is so delayed she'll miss her DFW connection
50901,54305,@JetBlue real disappointment since we bought this new luggage specifically for this very special Xmas trip.
50903,54307,Didn't realize that a new thing was to leave bags on aisle seats to save them on @SouthwestAir #sonotcool
50906,54311,@AlaskaAir okay - we landed without problems - digiplayers must have been located :)
50918,54323,@AmericanAir AA1006 not clear why this is a safety issue. Sounds like you're too cheap to fly the mechanic to Mexico to sign the paper.
50924,54329,Is there a way to appeal an airline to not lose your frequent flier status for the following year due to pregnancy/maternity leave? @united
50926,54331,@SouthwestAir You have lost a customer.  I lost over 153.000 points.  What happened to no expiration?!  I won't fly SWA. Post 1 of 153.000
50927,54332,Fianc is missing 2 rings after checking her bags through @AmericanAir last time I fly with them.
50946,54353,Hey @united. when you're late and overbooked on holidays. have crew tell people w/out connections to wait for us to disembark. #Furious
50957,54364,@JetBlue If SFO to Providence a seasonal flight? No flights are popping up... Just wanna meet my best friend yo :(
50960,54367,Plenty of us tweet when we are annoyed by poor service so I have to give a shout out to @AlaskaAir. They are awesome to deal with.
50974,54382,@AmericanAir lost Kindle on AA1558  ord to cun? First Class. What do I do?
50979,54388,@JetBlue terminal at #JFKInternationalAirport is so incredible it makes you wish for a delay. Off to #SantaFe
50987,54396,And @united is just as bad. 32-character password is completely gutted when you still also force users to have a 4-digit pin.
50994,54403,Plane broke. connections missed. @AmericanAir is passing out granola bars. This isn't fucking kindergarten. Bring on the whiskey.
50997,54406,First time not flying @SouthwestAir in a long time.. Also my first delay in a loooong time... #bahhumbug #JustGetMeThere
51007,54418,Psa - @SouthwestAir does not issue credit anymore unless you cancel your flight. Bye $300! #annoying

51022,54434,Couldn't use the boardroom at seatac cause they said my first class seat was an upgrade and Not paid in full price. Not cool @AlaskaAir
51030,54442,@SouthwestAir my flight was supposed to leave at 2:55.
51033,54445,I'm 99% sure that I've never in my life departed JFK with an on time departure @JetBlue :(

51165,54593,@JetBlue Its annoying that the automated while-u-wait greeting tells me I can cancel flight via website. Website directed me to phone :/
51166,54595,@AmericanAir why do you always mess up my flights?
51184,54614,"@DeltaAssist waiting for call back from the ""wait line"". Not sure why cancellation &amp; worried about rebook. Few inbound options to hometown."
51197,54628,first the airport port workers give me attitude.. Then I get the broken tv.. Lets see how my plane ride goes... #Jetblue @JetBlue
51202,54635,for the 2nd consecutive trip on @JetBlue my bag arrived without its TSA lock. hoping nothing is missing since it was open when i got it.

51676,55135,@AmericanAir can yall pick up the pace with the gate issues at DFW?! Knew I should've flew with #Southwest
51685,55146,@JetBlue what started as a great day has been a complete nightmare! Delayed flight led to losing my connection and now I've been redirected
51689,55150,Nothing will make you feel more legitimately insane than a confirmation email from @VirginAmerica to check in for a flight you didn't book.
51690,55151,Of course there isn't a direct flight from Laramie to Dallas. Even @united hates Wyoming. #gowyo http://t.co/G5ecpCN5rE
51697,55158,guess who hates @AmericanAir because they have had like 75 different delays on each plane i have gotten on #thisgirl
51713,55174,@SouthwestAir Delay from Vegas to Seattle means no ride. Any advice on cheaper means of transportation from airport to greenlake at 12:30am?
51714,55175,@VirginAmerica since when do you delay takeoff for late psgrs? 90% of us boarded on-time. stuck on runway for 50+ mins. What is this. Delta?
51717,55178,@AlaskaAir we were connecting. going through the International security. etcetera. the connecting flight couldn't wait for us or 8 others
51724,55185,@DeltaAssist Charged me $250 for a flight just to say it's full... So now I have to wait for my money. Can you refund me already?
51738,55202,@AmericanAir Unable to check in online. what seems to be the issue?
51743,55207,So my luggage broke on my way home. and @JetBlue gave me a new suitcase as an apology. Thanks again! :D Very kind! http://t.co/m1MxcqgbD0
51749,55213,Princess and I are NY bound. I haven't seen snow in 10 years and she has never seen it.  LOVE @VirginAmerica http://t.co/YmRJdlrPEy
51753,55217,Thank you @VirginAmerica for giving away the seat I paid for. even though I was on time for my flight! #worstcustomerservice
51757,55221,A 3 hour delay on @VirginAmerica from SF to LA. Thank goodness for vodka &amp; pinkberry.
51762,55226,@virginamerica I am missing a bunch of status and other points from my SFO-LAS flight in F (Y return); you just split in half.
51775,55240,@AmericanAir y'all couldn't wait 10 minutes for us 
51779,55244,@AmericanAir the Stewardess didn't even attempt to isolate the problem. I was a bit disgusted with just 'sorry'.
51793,55258,@JetBlue thanks guys! I would never have spoken to her the way she spoke to me.....Love you guys!!!! Regards. g3
51794,55259,@AmericanAir hard to match and Twitter AAs worse than regular AA. You look through your tweets and figure it out.
51800,55265,How have @DeltaAssist managed to behave so consistently terribly to my friends today. What the hell is wrong with your staff?
51805,55270,@JetBlue yes I want more info. since it was just delayed again. http://t.co/YLw6xigWUG
51808,55273,Eek. What did he say? Leave all carry on baggage behind??? I assume he means frenchies off first. Please check the @united rules.
51809,55274,Okay. This is why I don't like to fly with @AmericanAir internationally from MIA. I can never check in on the machines. Never.
51812,55277,If you're looking for Canes updates from Shreveport today. follow the reporters who aren't stuck in @AmericanAir hell.
51817,55282,@united You all have done everything in your power to make our first trip w/ a baby as stressful as possible. Never flying United again.
51829,55295,@united Amelia at your Premier Desk was an absolute wonder today..helped us move us from a delayed flight to an early arrival.#HappyHolidays
51846,55315,@AmericanAir Will you be putting a storm policy in place for flights from NY anytime soon? Want to leave earlier without breaking the bank!
51847,55316,I can't remember the last time I was on an @AmericanAir flight that actually took off on time lol. Delayed at DFW is the new norm.
51851,55321,I'm dissapointed @SouthwestAir I've been transferred around by chase and Southwest about a RR issue with pts I paid off not posting. #upset
51852,55322,@JetBlue #JetBluejingle Dashing to the gate. on such a festive date. it is a treat to fly JetBlue and we can hardly wait!
51856,55326,@JetBlue Can't wait to fly you in a few days. Get me out of here! :)
51860,55330,I had a little airplane it's name is @JetBlue when it's fueled and ready. i cant wait to flying with you! #jetbluejingle

51886,55358,@AmericanAir Missed my flight today because the printer was out of ink... Grrr #oldschoolproblems #cantscanthat http://t.co/BX7JrSxJcp
51888,55360,@AmericanAir we didn't miss our flight. we're Gold so had priority. but the regular line was a block long.
51894,55367,Standing room only at the DMV. Uh-oh. Hey @SouthwestAir. don't leave without me. k?
51896,55369,@AmericanAir Hi. I flew from Boston to NY yesterday! After arriving I am surprised that everything in my bag was stolen! Is that normal?
51901,55375,@AmericanAir hi. Would you be able to check the status of my complaint? Has a specialist been able to look at it?
51905,55379,Capt. it's cold outside But we can deice It could just be me and you But I've never flown @JetBlue Capt. its cold outside! #JetBlueJingle
51913,55388,@JetBlue will you be doing any fee waivers in the Northeast for Xmas Eve flights? Storm is looking bad. I want to get home earlier!
51916,55391,@united I have also contacted Customer Care in regards to this situation. Never in 30+ years of flying int'l have I seen such a run around!
51923,55398,.@SouthwestAir flight attendant said tell everyone we got you to Vegas 18 mins early. because we know you tell them when we're 5 mins late!
51924,55399,chg fees stink! want 2 leave day early so kids not stuck x-mas eve n airport. Expect more from great @VirginAmerica http://t.co/rv91vAgUVi
51925,55400,Lost my sister's bag. can't tell me where it is. can't track it. and they took her boarding pass. @SouthwestAir I am disappoint.
51926,55401,@AmericanAir Where are your social media problem solvers when I need them? Poof. arrive genies!
51927,55402,@JetBlue having problems sending. Can I email?
51928,55403,Got my first priority boarding assignment after getting the @united credit card. Less stress = better travel! Going home for Christmas.
51932,55407,@AlaskaAir Still waiting for your return call. http://t.co/zspGPqT0UK
51934,55409,@jetblue #jetbluesofly #delay #lgb http://t.co/5j8RyEQM3I
51935,55410,Made a stupid switch up on my sister's flight with @AmericanAir and customer service has been unhelpful. Even got hung up on. Polite hang up
51936,55411,@SouthwestAir no apologies needed. It's holidays families travel. I just really never seen that many babies on an airplane before.
51938,55413,@united yes but not until 10am tomorrow morning and I won't arrive until 8:45 pm missing my grandmothers funeral http://t.co/mQLOmJyF7u
51940,55415,@AmericanAir this is why my luggage is always lost #Nevahold http://t.co/RZMOiXLWwX
51946,55421,You'll NEVER find it online but this is the number for @AmericanAir baggage desk in Albuquerque airport:  (505) 842-2066
51948,55423,I've been mulling over status matching to @AlaskaAir but the idea of a whole fleet of 737s with those crappy Recaro seats gives me pause.
51950,55425,@JetBlue jingle bells. Delta smells. Southwest's just okay. JetBlue is the way to fly. I'd choose you any day ;) #JetBlue
51967,55443,@AlaskaAir conf VRPPXB my FF number is 63377263.  It's a brown shopping bad that says Sub Pop
51968,55444,@united it all got sorted out. Just not sure how how I was alerted that I was getting on the wrong plane.  3 of us. Aruba airport is a mess
51969,55445,You Rock @JetBlue ! Daughter in from Boston Last night. Her suit case broke a zipper. Jane was so helpful and gave her a new suitcase kudos!
51975,55451,@JetBlue pushing back early. wicked nice crew. and an open middle seat. No holiday travel nightmare stories here! #BostonhereIcome
51976,55452,Flight home is delayed. The only thing to do is watch The Grinch and drink. Ho ho ho @SouthwestAir
51982,55458,@united so scared about getting out on 12/24 due to the wind - mom is so sad i won't get home in time for Christmas. need to leave earlier:(
51988,55464,Flight to MS has been delayed twice. Best excuse I heard- there's no crew. @AmericanAir
52004,55481,@AmericanAir Did you somehow upset ORD ground control?  These taxiing patterns are ridiculous.
52014,55491,@DeltaAssist Hi. yesterday. I have completed an online complaint regarding a damaged bag. Any idea when I will receive some info from Delta?
52017,55494,@VirginAmerica Thanks for helping me easily cancel my holiday flights due to an unfortunate family emergency.
52020,55497,@SouthwestAir Part 1: 3 different people on 2 different calls couldn't assist me in obtaining a seat that wouldn't upset my claustrophobia.
52032,55509,Email from @united telling me to check in online. Go through the whole thing then get told I can't check in online. Stressful!
52054,55533,.@JetBlue Wait. you don't have mobile boarding passes either???
52064,55543,@VirginAmerica I don't need your sorry! We have been waiting since 1 pm and no clue what to do. I need you to resolve this asap!
52069,55548,Could @AmericanAir be more disgusting? #worstplanerideever http://t.co/NpCyS7EnNp
52074,55553,I miss you. @southwestair. I'll never leave you again. http://t.co/nsjxFBsS29
52081,55560,@AmericanAir  I'm reporting you to the department of transportation! Glad they publish these reports publicly so others won't suffer this.
52082,55561,@DeltaAssist so what happens if I miss flight 62 bos to cvg? Security line is crazy.
52084,55563,@united does not have enough wheelchair assistants so the disabled is just waiting around in chairs
52097,55577,@united  i did a claim. a week later no follow up calls. no baggage and as i do this 15 min wait to tru to speak to a person
52099,55579,Delayed flights when weather isn't involved is like eating at McDonald's when there's a Chipotle close by. Unforgivable. @SouthwestAir
52104,55584,What's worse than air travel in late December? Air travel with @united in late December.
52105,55585,@AlaskaAir If I book a flight using miles and then turns out i need to cancel. do the miles just get pushed back into my account?
52107,55587,@united do you plan ahead or just wing it. Ben delayed at SFO most of the morning now we have to wait on a new flight crew
52109,55589,@DeltaAssist Hi. We're going to miss our atlanta flight to YUL because of a delay in miami and no others flight today. Any solutions ? TY
52111,55591,So many flight delays. @SouthwestAir please don't cancel our flight from MCO to MKE tonight!!! #holidaytravel #winterweather
52116,55596,In #holidayspirit. @united sends out furry gifts to relieve stressful traveling http://t.co/msbLXs1oh8
52118,55598,@SouthwestAir currently at the airport waiting to board &amp; was wondering if you had power outlets on the plane?
52120,55600,Waiting for flight to LA with @united #ua1299 can't wait!
52122,55603,@SouthwestAir are flights out of SFO delayed?  status of #2879?
52125,55606,Hope @americanair invents the flux capacitor - it'd be the only thing that could compensate for poor logistics. #nexttimeflyvirgin #sfo
52131,55613,@AmericanAir Why would your agent cancel my Christmas Eve flights without me telling her to do so? I cannot comprehend the incompetence.
52132,55614,@united I am having a heck of a time trying to get reimbursed for my flight cancellations on nov 30. Is this intentional by united? Angry!
52135,55617,@JetBlue Do you buy chance have one  more code in you? I sing a jingle and dance! And I am horrible at both! Need a flight for my sister.
52137,55621,@AmericanAir IM VERY MAD WITH YOUR SERVICES. LONG ANGRY LETTER WILL BE COMING FROM ME SOON.
52140,55624,This is bullshit @JetBlue #whattheFUCK
52151,55636,my luggages lost by #AmericanAirlines on Miami-Curitiba = #nightmare. Avoid @AmericanAir at all costs. retweet. retweet. retweet!
52159,55645,Bad experiences with @united are piling up. I dont think Ill fly with them any more and I recommend you dont either.
52160,55646,@united Landed RIC 35mn late &amp; only 3 ramp workers? Have to wait for gate because 2 planes ahead of us to push.  How is this #flyerfriendly?
52172,55658,@JetBlue is there a problem with the app? I can't sign in or check in for my flight tomorrow.
52183,55671,Love to love ya. @JetBlue. but your TrueBlue sign-in has been giving me a hell of a time. What gives? Website down?
52184,55672,I LOVE flying @JetBlue . Flying other airlines. I never knew how spoiled I was with legroom. #ThankYouJetblue #TrueBlue
52185,55673,@JetBlue I love you and all but 2 open counters out of 6 at the holiday season is not cool. Plus your phone app stops working NOW?!?
52187,55675,@united Not a bad way to kill a little time #UnitedClub #TriniBound http://t.co/IhwFx9TKKz
52191,55679,@DeltaAssist lost both ow and username
52192,55680,@AlaskaAir Delay is a bummer but kudos to the super friendly staff in the PDX Board Room. Having a nice place to wait makes a difference!
52193,55681,@JetBlue The flight status checker on your website/app is not working. I can't see if flight # 1371 is on time.
52199,55687,@United makes me miss my connection. strands me &amp; says to go wait in this line. #neveragain http://t.co/df387TUMxy
52206,55694,Hi @jetblue. is your site not working? Looking for update on flight status tonight. JFK-PWM flight 108. On hold for a while on the phone...
52209,55697,Should have packed a second book to read. Now I'm waiting outside the @JetBlue gate bored. Can't wait to get home to #Boston!
52211,55699,@JetBlue hi is your site down? Trying to check a flight status on mobile and it's not working.
52228,55717,Whats the best way to lodge a formal complaint with @AmericanAir ? 2 canceled flights with no compensation is a bit ridiculous.
52241,55732,@AlaskaAir what's the point of booking tickets side by side if they get switched with no notice? #unhappysurprise
52244,55735,I would hate to be the guy that runs the @united account lol. Has to deal with 97% hate. #crappyjob #crappycompany
52246,55737,Super cool that @AlaskaAir charged me $125 to keep my return flight when I was late for my outbound flight.
52247,55738,@jetblue I see there's an issue with checking in. Is there an ETA on the fix?
52251,55742,If it wasn't for my canceled @united flight I would have had to wait till the newyear to empty my dishwasher. Things do happen for a reason!
52261,55753,There's slow. And then there's @SouthwestAir 's boarding process.
52262,55754,@JetBlue Hope your planes work better than the online check-in system! #broken #pleasefix
52273,55767,@AmericanAir your first class FA on #4354 to EWR doesn't speak to first class but has problem gabbing to other FA's. Find her name &amp; do some
52279,55773,@DeltaAssist is it possible to reschedule flights from Charlotte on Wednesday with the bad weather coming or is it best to wait?
52289,55784,@JetBlue info flight from San Juan PR to FLL it was delayed
52293,55789,@JetBlue just saw that you don't issue gift cards anymore. Is that true? If so. why did you decide to stop?
52302,55798,Day 6: You can try your hold music torture tactics. @united . but I won't give up! #lostsuitcase #unitedstolechristmas
52303,55799,@JetBlue any word on flight 418? is it delayed?
52309,55805,"To the @SouthwestAir dude who just told the mother of a crying child ""No crying allowed in the airport!  Heh heh heh""  You are bad"
52339,55838,Eeeeeh @united better you solve the problem with the connection of my dearly friend Kike or he could fight with 15 ninjas gringos.
52345,55844,@AlaskaAir why is flight 822 delayed? Super inconvenient because my ride has to work tomorrow morning
52346,55845,@JetBlue been waiting 35 minutes for the baggage to start to come down the carousel at JFK. Flight from vegas 748. What's the deal?
52351,55850,@AmericanAir stuck in LAX with a delayed flight and no one can tell us if we're going to make our connecting in Vegas. #nothappy
52354,55853,@DeltaAssist why the issue with processing PWM miles? Never works. I've DMed you details.
52355,55854,Really disappointed that @JetBlue no longer has a route from Dulles to Oakland. _ #timeforanewairline 
52362,55861,@JetBlue made it to Logan. waiting 4 connection in Wolfgang Pucks. Headed home to OGS via Cape air. Thanks.. Blue Crew. See you 1/3.
52365,55864,@JetBlue you guys are best airline around. WiFi in the air! Well now we wait to land in JFK #NewYorkBound #BrooklynsSonIsComingHome
52378,55878,When you spend a long week dealing with consistent inefficiency. it__s great to be able to travel without any issues. Thx @VirginAmerica
52384,55884,@JetBlue never flown on JetBlue before. I'd love to!
52389,55889,@VirginAmerica definitely wins for customer service of an airline. First time flying another airline in awhile and miss Virgin!
52396,55896,stuck overnight in Denver.  Paid way more money to get their tonight not tomorrow @united this is the 2nd hellacious trip ..#reimbursement
52400,55900,Thank you @VirginAmerica for having sockets in your planes. _  Love. People like myself with Jurassic phones that no longer hold a charge
52401,55901,Jonah did great on the plane just one problem. @alaskaair lost our car seat. So_we are stuck at the airport until further notice. Yay.
52403,55903,@AmericanAir Whoops! My bad! 2353
52413,55914,@united look like you cancelled my reservation. What did you guys did????
52434,55935,Big thank you to Burt at LAX @VirginAmerica! Worked his magic and was a wicked huge help.
52438,55939,@JetBlue missing mosaic for 2015 by $100 ... That's crazy!!!
52449,55953,Always been a fan of @SouthwestAir! They are my airline if choice! Not tonight tho with their handling of lost luggage! Boooooo
52459,55963,@SouthwestAir talk about bad timing. How frustrating. #madtraveler http://t.co/zzKkjPgfMA
52466,55971,@JetBlue thanks for your condolences but we've been on call hold for 20+ mins and nothing.. Not impressed with your damage control
52479,55985,I'll live a merry life if I never fly with @JetBlue again.
52483,55989,What a mess @AmericanAir tonight. Delay LAX-SFO longer than the flight itself. Now I need to scramble for my connection.
52484,55990,I'd rather be stuck on the tarmac on a @VirginAmerica flight than any other airline. #TV
52492,55999,@jetblue does it again! Redirects flight from long beach to LAX and there's no plane! Hooray for holiday stress. http://t.co/ktWJfZmkgo
52507,56016,@united why does united ALWAYS hang up on me? #mad
52513,56022,THIS IS SO CUTE WHY AM I POOR AND CANT DO THE SAME TO MY MOM ON CHRISTMAS COME ON @VirginAmerica http://t.co/G1hDAea4VX
52533,56042,could be worse -- i'm reading people's tweets to @jetblue from lax.  actually having a rather nice night.
52535,56044,Practice up selling economy passengers by @DeltaAssist is making a last minute trip for medical emergency more stressful without a seat.
52536,56045,@JetBlue laying on the ground waiting for this flight. That im sure they will cancel because they can't fly after 3am?!?!
52541,56050,thank you @JetBlue for cancelling our flight and letting a machine tell us. happy holidays to you too
52553,56063,I really wish @southwestair flew out of LEX. Would never be a question of whom to fly.
52556,56066,@JetBlue apparently there is no flight number to rebook us and I was just hung up on while using the call in number.
52559,56069,Thanks @AlaskaAir for destroying my bag hopefully my Xbox one isn't dead http://t.co/lOF5reSj3x
52560,56070,@JetBlue usually only tweet airlines when I'm mad but have to say... Great experience at #JFK today. As easy &amp; stress free as possible
52563,56075,Can we please talk about how @SouthwestAir makes you wait in the cold to check your bags. #NeverAgain #merrychristmas
52569,56081,Hey @United lines at Dulles just to check bags awful. Everyone worried about missing flights http://t.co/tr0bsHjaBT
52570,56082,@AlaskaAir saves the day! They helped us find my poor wife's wedding ring that she dropped. One of the many reasons #iflyalaska
52579,56091,Even worse is that they drag their feet to check us in to avoid us switching airlines @AmericanAir . The heights of theft
52583,56095,@VirginAmerica and it appears my bag either was left at Vegas for my layover or never got on the plane in LA... Really?!
52596,56108,@DeltaAssist I'm missing THOUSANDS of miles from several recent trips. Miles counted 1 way only. or only 1 leg. How do I ensure FFM credit?
52597,56109,@AmericanAir I'm missing THOUSANDS of miles from several recent trips. Miles counted 1 way only. or only 1 leg. How do I ensure FFM credit?
52609,56121,Aside from the nonstop crying of children and the guys behind me yapping in Chinese. not a bad flight @united #yaright #needcoffee #fml
52613,56125,@united I am very dissatisfied with my recent trip with United. What is the best contact? Do you have a postal address for the UK?
52614,56126,@AmericanAir I have the number. That's not the issue
52615,56127,@JetBlue so the weaver for tomorrow are just in case people want to change/cancel their flights correct? But you guys haven't cancel any?
52618,56130,@united been waiting for cc since nov. 22. You do the math!!
52626,56139,@JetBlue you guys killed it in the JFK airport with the free holiday photo #bestholidayexperienceever http://t.co/YWT0FPNGeZ
52628,56142,@AmericanAir Flight delayed four hours so far due to a mech issue on your end. Any chance you can confirm when 1155's new plane will arrive?
52629,56143,@JetBlue stuck in the plane
52633,56147,@SouthwestAir can you please tell me what's going on with flight 830 (bwi-&gt;cmh)? Is there a chance we will leave before 2:40pm?
52636,56150,can't wait to board our plane To Seattle from Boston. @JetBlue JetBlue http://t.co/0kw4GEEyjh
52640,56154,I seriously hope @AmericanAir is proactive with all the connecting flights since its flight from KC to Dallas left 30 min late this morn.
52650,56165,@DeltaAssist flight 1970. emergency landing in Birmingham. Need an update asap on ETA INTO MSY.. Generator failed?? Not updating them.
52651,56166,@VirginAmerica Thanks for making sure I'd make it through security this morning after waiting an hour for the P.A. to inspect my firearm!
52653,56168,@SouthwestAir If the predictions for Chicago tomorrow get worse. where will you put up a warning? I want to change my flight if it looks bad
52668,56184,@AmericanAir Very underhanded practices by AA Groups. Only 20% allowed to change dates after deposit. only they never tell you that b4 hand.
52708,56227,@JetBlue Why is my mobile boarding pass not working? And why was there no bag option during check-in?
52716,56235,@SouthwestAir can't wait they say. teenager already asleep. Lol see ya soon! http://t.co/0M1Edz5WBi
52722,56242,Lost a necklace but made my flight - thanks to @AlaskaAir swift self-tag baggage.

53028,56562,@United #loyalty program changes are terrible. Miles and minimum spend. They interpret your spend and make some ineligible!!! #crockofshit
53033,56567,@AmericanAir just delayed my flight and downgraded me to a middle seat unless I pay them for a premium seat. It's like blackmail at 30k feet
53037,56572,@JetBlue Why are we delayed Orlando into Westchester County? #1494
53040,56575,@AmericanAir I know. but I want to do it online to skip the wait and because of your non-sense premium seat policy I can't. Bad Experience
53044,56580,To all the new followers of @AmericanAir    When they screw you with your travel nobody gets back to you . They don't care about you
53048,56585,@AmericanAir  the only tv on board broken   Refund ?   #thatwouldbeachristmasmiricle http://t.co/GVdk8kXNBx
53051,56588,Just what I need to see. Airplanes clipping wings before I travel. That's not helping my nerves!! I never hear of that from @JetBlue :)
53052,56589,Oh @AmericanAir. I know I should expect that you'll cancel a flight 18 hours prior to takeoff. but I wish I didn't.
53054,56591,This is torture. Just get me home tonight. That's all I ask of you. @SouthwestAir! #HomewardBound http://t.co/j2VnQ0fw1t

53097,56638,@united screwed up. Again. Oh wait. they ALWAYS do.
53110,56654,@united what % of your flights are delayed because you don't adequately time the deplane/loading process? Seems high.
53120,56664,Yay @united missed my connection...surprised?
53125,56669,I am NEVER flying @united again I am basically stranded here in Birmingham or more than likely stranded in Colorado. Amazing
53133,56677,@JetBlue your flight tracker function not working.  What's up with it?
53138,56683,@JetBlue Gate 33B doesn't lock. Kind've scary. Gate Agents just noticed the security lock is broken. http://t.co/SsR2xXtTEN
53141,56686,@united made complaint was told a report was unnecessary unless we wanted to file with our personal travel insurance co.
53144,56689,@JetBlue The app and TrueBlue (on site) won't let me log in (not password issue). Is there an issue?
53147,56692,Pretty sure the stress of #flight1318 has taken years off my life. almost 11 hours at JFK waiting for same flight. Thx @JetBlue #jetblew
53148,56693,All boarded on @SouthwestAir can't wait to get back to #CT

53198,56746,@JetBlue thank you. Juliet at MCO for getting me and my family re routed to JFK after awful delay at EWR! #thankful
53202,56750,@SouthwestAir in what circumstance would they partially board 1007 from DCA &gt;TPA then switch the gate after ppl are already on that plane?
53204,56752,First time flying @JetBlue and my flight was delayed 
53207,56756,@AmericanAir I'm stuck on the runway at #stl and flight 4358 to #ord is boarding. Wait for me. wait for me?! #prettyplease #badday #travel
53210,56759,@united Otherwise. you're stuck?

53224,56773,I've never had the privilege of writing an angry @united tweet like many of my friends. but I'm getting close.
53231,56781,@JetBlue just sad that this common in all airlines. Excuses for bad service received that is of far less quality than money paid.
53235,56785,@SouthwestAir what are the chances SW flight from Chicago to LAX is delayed fro the 5pmish flight?
53238,56788,I never know if my mom is messing with me or for real...about to die. @united wouldn't let us pee the whole flight! http://t.co/S8zChc0fNh
53253,56803,@DeltaAssist y'all kill joying x-mas plans. Cancel DL 5439 so we can at least confirm seats tomorrow and get out up in ATL.
53256,56806,Will never fly @SouthwestAir again. the flights are always delayed.
53261,56811,@JetBlue is a great way to fly! Love the TV and variety of snacks. Sad they will be charging for bags soon.  _

53290,56841,Ironic that @united has a 5 min. video on customer service pre-flight. when they cancel my flight home &amp; redirect me to wrong city #travel
53294,56845,@AmericanAir My brother is flying in from DAY O.H (is supposed to) hes now going to miss his connection from DFW  to ABQ bcuz a delay in DAY

53311,56863,Despite having my bag since 8:30 last night @AmericanAir has yet to bother getting it back to me. Had forgotten competence a foreign concept
53312,56864,Screw you @VirginAmerica- unable to see my fam/alone for Xmas because the check-in desk lady f'ed up. then lied to cover her ass #NeverAgain
53313,56865,Seriously. @SouthwestAir is patrolling the waiting area to hand out early boarding for obese passengers?
53315,56867,Not sure I have ever taken an @united flight that has gotten me to my destination on the scheduled DAY. never mind on time
53317,56869,Every time I fly @JetBlue  my tv is broken

53328,56880,Major props to @VirginAmerica team members at SFO. They were able to print out a receipt I had lost. Smooth service indeed
53330,56882,@united delayed today not flying out. Tickets in hand for tomorrow afternoon but I was told to go online for compensation vouchers. How?
53331,56883,The destination is just the excuse http://t.co/ILJYRYV2oQ #travel #inspiration @JetBlue

53348,56900,@AlaskaAir getting us out late and with no whiskey service. u disappoint the PNW
53357,56909,@DeltaAssist I am furious at how poorly you're treating the flights of my 76 yo mother. in a wheelchair. today -  you should be ashamed!
53361,56914,Packing game is strong   Thanks @AlaskaAir for waiving the bag fee! Flight was delayed but that's no big deal. http://t.co/JewcUFi1hI

53364,56917,I can always count on @SouthwestAir for a flight delay 
53366,56919,Come on. @AmericanAir - where's the value in landing early if you sit on the runway waiting for a gate to open? O'Hare not big enough?
53371,56924,Our @SouthwestAir flight is delayed out of SJC so we miss connecting to El Paso 0 flights to El Paso today or tomorrow. #erikandwillsavexmas
53376,56930,@JetBlue THANK YOU!!  I'll leave it at that.  #NYPD
53385,56939,@JetBlue not cool when your plane smells like a porta-potty after a concert in the middle of June #yuck 
53396,56951,@united UA5465 quit dicking us around and say the plane is delayed more than 5 minutes at a time!!!!
53398,56953,So sad. @AmericanAir
53412,56969,@united. I hate you. I can count the number of on-time flights I've had with you in the past five years on one hand.
53429,56986,@AmericanAir the thing is... That plane is always causing trouble. Change it already. What are you waiting for?
53447,57008,I know the weather is out of @united control but changing my brother's direct flight to a layover in Chicago of all places sucks __
53460,57021,Hate when you're flying back home to meet up with your bet longtime friends and every @SouthwestAir flight is delayed!  #badplan #gottawork
53473,57037,Seriously @SouthwestAir my flight is 75 mins??!!!! If I was 75 mins late you wouldn't wait for me. #doublestandard #timetofindanewairline

53522,57089,praying @SouthwestAir doesn't screw up our flight home like on our way here _ #NeverFlySouthwest
53528,57095,@AlaskaAir it is frustrating when you say you are boarding folks who don't need the overhead then board people with roller bags anyway.
53534,57101,@JetBlue Hey!! Is there a problem with your webpage? I am trying to log in into my TB account and I cant. I need to manage a flight and book
53535,57102,@AmericanAir very disappointed with your services and staff after tonight's encounter in Raleigh #StepitUp
53539,57106,@united. if you are going to cancel flights 3 hours later. at midnight.  at least order us some pizza and beers.

53638,57210,@AmericanAir should I use my AAdvantage # on http://t.co/PHzyeljoC3 or after the trip is completed I fill the form for missing miles on AA?

53970,57562,What is the point of arriving early to an airport to then leave you stuck in the runway? @AmericanAir
53978,57570,@VirginAmerica This is great until the person in front reclines and the kid in back starts kicking the seats #whoyouzoomin
53979,57571,@DeltaAssist flew from MSP to Rome. 4 lugage pieces lost. 1 delivered 30 hrs late. Your tracker ways it's at JFK. NYC http://t.co/UyTAUaeTA8

53990,57582,@JetBlue Not in Portland but if #flyingitforward New York and leave flowers site of the WTC and hug a friend who I thought i lost that day.

57688,61515,Hi @DeltaAssist. Onboard DL733 from DTW to SEA. flight had been delayed but no reason stated. Any information?
57701,61543,@DeltaAssist where do I go to file an official complaint?
57709,61551,Does #allegientair have anyone that watches Twitter? I wish they had someone like @DeltaAssist. Friend is having major issue with Allegient.
57711,61553,@united screws up again. Shocking.
57728,61572,First world problems. Losing my Gold status on @AlaskaAir for 2015. Was hoping for a New Years promotion to save my status! No such luck.
57739,61584,@AmericanAir. tweet me if you lost my email.  I'm only 3k from elite. http://t.co/NRHtzlsaoT
57742,61588,How did I guess this was @united airline?   Woman Sues Airline after Being Jailed for Seat Switch / Sputnik US - News http://t.co/RaiJzl0DB4

57762,61610,The @SouthwestAir app is really embarrassingly awful. Doesn't save your info or remember your flights or do much of anything. really.
57766,61614,Wish my flight was longer with the @AmericanAir 1st class beds!
57768,61617,Sad to have to fly to Syracuse tonight for father-in-law's funeral. Silver lining: seeing family and flying last-minute #Mint on @JetBlue
57771,61620,@JetBlue is clearly my favorite airline for playing benny &amp; the jets while on hold
57773,61622,@united I have an email complaint I can send to you describing what happened. What is the best email?
57775,61624,@VirginAmerica never!!!
57776,61625,Excuse me @SouthwestAir OBVIOUSLY I need to improve
57779,61628,@VirginAmerica I wonder what happened to our fragile tag.  Does explain the broken glass in suitcase though
57785,61634,@DeltaAssist how do I report a missing leg and its respective miles on my skymiles account?
57793,61642,@AlaskaAir any chance you guys could make board room passes digital in the future? Frustrating that everything but that can be found online.
57794,61643,I am going to miss being a 75K! @AlaskaAir you have been so good to me this year xoxo
57811,61661,Maybe I'm just spoiled by the @JetBlue terminal at JFK but the concession game in terminal 3 at LAX is the worst
57816,61667,Not sure who I feel worse for. Those of dealing with the idiocy of @united or those who work for them. Gate folks look exhausted and bummed.
57837,61689,@united I'm platinum on Delta and am looking to make a switch - do you offer any reciprocity?

58989,62920,@united to say the dog carrier was placed under the wing. is clearly a lie. Perhaps u forgot the reflection of the wings on the ground.
58992,62923,@SouthwestAir I have a stream of texts that are back and forth alerts. talk about a frustrating travel day http://t.co/o7qd63SysF
58996,62927,"@united a delay of nearly 1h and more for ""weather problems"" and all the technicians outside looking something to do."

59498,63475,"My @JetBlue flight is delayed because they're waiting on ""communication with HQ in NY about a mechanical issue"". We are in Long Beach."
59499,63476,Way to go @AmericanAir for failing to recognize my tsa precheck number. It worked last month. Now stuck in this massive line.
59503,63480,@AmericanAir - what's the deal with mechanical issues on flight 2763? At this rate I'll be celebrating the New Year at O'Hare.
59505,63482,@DeltaAssist What phone # or process do I use for Lost and Found?  Re: a flight this morning.

59571,63555,Seriously @VirginAmerica you just keep doing what you do. and I'll make sure never to fly with anyone else. Best airline I've ever flown.
59573,63557,@SouthwestAir can you imagine the smell
59576,63560,@VirginAmerica free breakfast AND movies?! Please delay all my future flights too! #FLL -&gt; #SFO
59586,63570,My flight has officially been booked with @JetBlue. Can't wait for my vacation well deserved must say!!!

59675,63665,@AmericanAir Why did you switch aircraft for flight 1544 to a plane that is going to make us late to BOS? TAIL Changed From N917AN To N920AN
59676,63666,@united when you're waiting for the flight crew to arrive to board long after the boarding time. that's uncool! Flight 377
59731,63722,@DeltaAssist is RTW SkyMiles desk open? or was it closed down early? Was on hold to be xferred there for 90+ mins yesterday. 50 so far today
59735,63726,@AmericanAir had me at SFO airport for hours. and the sky's clear. Now my NYE is off to a bad start. No event. just bad memories.
59736,63727,Shout out to the best airline (@AmericanAir) for reuniting me with my lost stuff.
59737,63728,"@united~Really?!? Then why do your ""best"" customers die while in your care? Why leave them on tarmacs in rain or 100 degree heat? #UnitedSux"
59746,63739,First time flying @AlaskaAir from BLI to Vegas . 4hr flight delay in Vegas today sucks!
59755,63748,@AmericanAir so. are the Dallas cancellations AHEAD of bad weather? Doesn't seem horrible up there now...
59760,63754,@VirginAmerica There was an item lost from my gate-checked bag going from O'hare to LAX. What's the best way to file a claim?
59786,63780,Why oh why does the guy playing Matt Busby in United on drama tv sound like he's from India. I thought he was Scottish!! #fail @united
59791,63785,@JetBlue Sell seats on aircraft with known temperature control issues. without informing customers? Very poor form. https://t.co/ifr4Zyykg6
59793,63788,@SouthwestAir Why do you lie to your customers and tell them mid flight their connection isn't happening? U waste their time and money
59799,63794,Also. changing information in your @VirginAmerica profile shouldn't be this poor. Errors out on everything :(
59813,63808,@SouthwestAir why is LAX-Houston late? Can you provide champagne at least if i miss my flight to TPA?
59817,63813,Nothing like arriving early just to be late because @united doesn't have a gate available.
59819,63815,@AlaskaAir I still remember that one time this year when I was late to my flight and you guys took care of me. Thank you! #iflyalaska

59844,63843,@united that suggests either a ponderously slow clock or a dangerously fast swallow.

59961,63967,@alaskaair switching to your mileage plan in 2015 after years with Delta. A move to SEA and your new routes to DTW &amp; TPA have me excited!
59964,63970,@JetBlue not a great way to kick off 2015 with a broken down plane in Ft Lauderdale #BadEngine #JetBlue
59965,63971,@JetBlue based on when my Delta Gold medallion status was finally approved I missed the Mosaic challenge by ~1.100 points per rep
59970,63976,Never been on a plane for New Years.  At least there is booze.  @AlaskaAir
59976,63982,I don't like the way @united treat Nigerians flying international..They treat Nigerians really bad like we can't mobilize and boycott..

60379,64413,@SouthwestAir any way to add more channels to your onboard TV?  Sad I will be missing my alma mater play in the NCAA football playoffs.
60380,64414,Made ORD in time for my SFO connection. but will likely miss it because @AmericanAir doesn't have enough gates here. Waiting on tarmac....
60382,64417,Don't think I'm going to fly @AmericanAir again. Missed our flt because of mechanical issues.. Really.

60437,64483,@united going to need some info on this waiting for people and random bag policy - #DoTheRightThing
60450,64498,Of course... The one time I decide to check a bag... It gets lost. #Southwest @SouthwestAir
60451,64499,@DeltaAssist So I missed Platinum by $550 and four days. Seems a little cold and impersonal.
60454,64502,@united u left our baby seat in ewr and tried to give us a carrier max 22 lbs for a 30 lb baby #irresponsible #lawsuit
60462,64510,@jetblue I have a complaint re my trip last month. The SFO counter didn't open until 5am. It used to open at 4:30am. This was an issue b/c
60463,64511,Shoutout to @united for being the shittiest airline and canceling my flight
60478,64527,@AmericanAir you're annoying
60489,64538,@AmericanAir Flight number 6 from Maui to Dallas. Supposed to leave at 5:55 and we're still here at the airport. Just wondering what's up.
60495,64545,@AmericanAir way to ruin New Years for a lot of people. Is it too much to ask that you cancel the flight this morning rather than waiting!?!
60509,64560,Either tell me before I leave to get a new crate or let me ship my dog @United
60510,64562,@DeltaAssist: BCN-SFO via JFK delayed 14 hours! No re-routing offered. No emergency crew provided so we could leave at normal time.???
60512,64564,Very disappointed that @JetBlue didn't hit me up to do a vine together... I thought we were friends. Caribbean without you 
60514,64567,Thank you @JetBlue for your understanding in cancelling my tickets due to a death in the family.  #customerservicesuccess
60517,64571,@AmericanAir My RL is IWNTSJ. Flight attendant name is Rachel. Her ID 118194. I'm very hurt and upset I was told I was offensive for nursing
60525,64580,@AmericanAir If my laptop gets damaged from #valet bag on flight #2891 I'm going to be mad.
60527,64582,@DeltaAssist Looks like we will miss our connection due to a problem with our plane on our 1st leg. What can we do?
60531,64586,@DeltaAssist What's the reason DL 568 is delayed from Seattle into JFK?
60534,64590,@AmericanAir um my flight's delayed because your plane broke. Had to deplaned. move terminals. and go through security again #AA90 #DFWtoORD
60537,64593,Second flight of the trip cancelled. @united do you actually operate fights out of DRO or do you just sell tickets and cancel?
60545,64601,@AmericanAir im stuck in JFK. i supposed to be already in Spain. Whats going on ???? Im so mad with all this !!!!
60546,64602,@AmericanAir we are here for 2912 from STL to NYC. But stuck in line to check in. Concerned as boarding starts in 5 minutes.  Yikes.
60558,64614,@united charged me $265 for an extra 13 pounds of weight. I hope management can solve this issue because i didn't want to miss my flight.
60559,64615,BOYCOTT! Beginning in 2016. @SouthwestAir switch to #biofuels #Biomass is NOT #c

60594,64652,Sitting at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport waiting for ice to melt... @AlaskaAir doesn't have de-icer in the desert? Six P's...
60595,64653,@AmericanAir Hi! Looks like a missed an important document in one of your flights on Sunday. how can I claim it?
60596,64655,Mine and the rents' @JetBlue flights leave back to back from the same gate. Nice to spend a bit more time w/ them before the vaca's over!
60607,64669,@united is the worst airline with which I play travel. http://t.co/tvbbeHLOws
60609,64671,My grandmas flying back out to Arizona today. Gonna miss her @SouthwestAir you make sure she arrives comfortably
60613,64676,@AlaskaAir that's sad news. We drive to Seattle every year from Canada and fly to Long Beach. We love it
60622,64689,@JetBlue years ago I was a pax traveling from MIA - IAH. I feel asleep. when I woke up my head was on the strangers shoulder next to me! Ugh
60627,64694,@DeltaAssist I can't checkin through the delta app. DOB feature not working. resets to today's date.

60637,64704,@AmericanAir but it's not cash!!!  Just cancel the card # &amp; send me a new one or a refund!  I'm going to the TX AG's office and BBB!!!!!
60643,64710,@DeltaAssist This was on Wed. It was followed by next leg TV outage and broken heat which FAs were aware. The wall mess is not uncommon IME
60660,64728,@DeltaAssist I dont need re-booking assistance. Im just inconvenienced by this going on 3 hour delay after traveling all night.
60682,64751,And @AmericanAir lost my bags! Made it back to SF tho.
60685,64754,@AmericanAir everyone has been taken off the flight and maintenance is handling the problem.
60700,64769,Too bad @VirginAmerica makes you go through the ringer when getting credit for an ill family member.

60726,64796,@VirginAmerica thanks for the ride all was great except for the broken FCSeat for my hubby.
60735,64806,@VirginAmerica I really can't wait to fly with you.
60736,64807,@AmericanAir You guys need to sort your boarding procedures out! So inefficient. now looks like we're going to miss our intnl connection.

61000,65096,@SouthwestAir 2.3h mechanical delay. Public transit in Atlanta will be stopped when I make it home. Maybe you can chip in on a cab?
61017,65115,I have never had luck with @united in Chicago once in my last 16 years of traveling by air. It's always delayed. no flights for the night
61021,65119,Are you kidding me @united ? Plane 2hrs late to terminal &amp; so full of human waste that we've been advised to use facilities before boarding.

62129,66293,Thanks for playing Beyonc at check in. @VirginAmerica. you made traveling a little less stressful. #iwokeuplikethis
62134,66298,@JetBlue they are. But. why were we waiting for a plane stucked in Maine? The airline could have provided another plane. #frustratingindeed

63086,67314,Everytime I check a bag on @SouthwestAir I end up having to wait 45+ minutes for it at baggage claim #stillwaiting
63126,67355,Really missing the plug ins on this US Airways flight! It feels weird not being on @AlaskaAir
63136,67366,Delta airlines is awful! Fights always cancelled or delayed! And it's NEVER delta's fault! @DeltaAssist
63137,67367,@DeltaAssist sadly no. This was earlier today when my team had a playoff game. I was disappointed to have missed it due to no wi-fi.
63158,67391,@DeltaAssist i did. and that doesn't excuse overselling your flight
63159,67392,@united is consistently late with departures. The past 4 flights have all been delayed without any real reason (ie: weather). Never again.
63167,67400,@AmericanAir yes recent versions of Chrome and Firefox. it's like the JavaScript gets hung up waiting for assets to load for a long time
63170,67403,@AmericanAir paid additional for reclining chair in emergency exit. but seat is damaged. Do I get a refund here? http://t.co/auCUGLz847
63175,67409,I've seen way too many bad airline tweets recently... I have to fly in the AM... Please @united don't screw up my flights 
63188,67422,So incredibly disappointed in my seat @VirginAmerica #uncomfortable #extremelyuncomfortable

63243,67480,@SouthwestAir I will always fly Southwest. I missed my flight and they redirected me immediately. You guys are the best.
63247,67484,Is there a reason you keep canceling every flight I book @AmericanAir you never give a reason. Just really don't want me in Corpus today?
63254,67491,I can't remember the last time I've flown on @AmericanAir and NOT had some sort of delay or issue. #getittogether #fixyourplanes 
63257,67494,Wow - Sister delayed Wchster airport cause crew have yet to leave their hotel - Way to go @JetBlue. She's tryin to visit our sick mother

63264,67501,Had a direct flight on @SouthwestAir from Chicago. and they lost my bag. Really hopeful they find it today.
63267,67504,@AmericanAir ...issue was u would not reinstate our tickets after cancelling them even with drs certificate
63272,67509,@united Booked &amp; paid for our business class tickets last Sept &amp; then refused flights when checking in 2 hrs early! Unhappy.
63274,67511,@AmericanAir come on!  FLT 1455 Ridiculously tiny legroom.  A lot of angry customers here on this flight  #ripoff http://t.co/8uOMf1QSmx
63285,67523,Stuck in usa for 2 more days after @AmericanAir refused to take us because of nut allergy
63287,67525,"@JetBlue ""Mint"" flights leave a sour taste for coach customers. Stand in line for seat ""selection""? #NoChoice"
63293,67532,Is @SouthwestAir 521 always a 300? I don't mind not having WiFi between OAK &amp; LAX but that must suck for the folks on the LAX-AUS leg.
63294,67533,@AmericanAir not even a comment re AA121 1/2/15 preplanned/unscheduled stopover because plane was to small to carry load CDG-JFK  poor form
63298,67537,Flying @SouthwestAir to #ATL for work just in time to miss this extra cold whether and snow in the #Midwest. See ya next Tuesday. #Chicago
63308,67548,Volunteered to switch my flight. got a refund and a $100 voucher with only a 20 minute difference in arrival time. Why I fly @SouthwestAir
63315,67555,@AmericanAir upgraded me for my inconvenience. This is why I believe they are the best airline 
63317,67558,@DeltaAssist Hiya! It seems the app won't pull up the Today screen if the flight is delayed. Got this at boarding. http://t.co/CvCi5RNXCW
63321,67562,Seriously @AmericanAir you can't do math to make sure your pilot can fly? You really are going from bad to horrendous. Let's all count to 60
63328,67569,Totally looking forward to sprinting to my connecting flight and the possibility of missing it.  #sarcasm @united
63331,67572,@JetBlue not an excuse. Then why have passengers board (&amp; have to sit on the plane) knowing this? #jetblue has gone down hill over the years
63334,67575,@DeltaAssist Hi! Can you help me unlock my acct? After switching from pin to p/w. I locked it w/a forgotten p/w.
63335,67576,@JetBlue was GREAT only bad thing was man attendant on flt #1321 (#Boston to WPB) asked me (Disabled after heart attack) to get my own bag?
63337,67578,.@JetBlue ushering in sad. new era and risks alienating its loyal passengers http://t.co/Pdaf3KjJPe #travel #RIP
63349,67593,@DeltaAssist DUSKL28593 is what i got in dusseldorf. DL 6210 JFK to Barcelona is what i got in New York. Plane broke down. I left the next
63356,67600,Shout out to @united for how they managed the bad weather from London. AWESEOME flight crew &amp; the captain kept us updated #BestFlightEver
63362,67607,Really hoping that @SouthwestAir finds my missing bag today.
63366,67611,@AmericanAir I understand that. but you had all night to do that. Why wait until the last minute. That is a lot of poor planning going on!
63368,67614,Really hoping that @SouthwestAir finds my missing bag ASAP!
63369,67616,@SouthwestAir  first flight of year with mechanical issue. #comeonman !!!   Flight 500 Lv to SLC
63370,67617,Missed status on @united by 45 miles 
63372,67619,@DeltaAssist all my rollover miles are missing. Who do I call to fix that?
63373,67620,I thought I was down with @AmericanAir delays. Nope. Time for repairs while I wait in the plane.
63376,67623,You were going to help re. lost item on plane @VirginAmerica Have heard nothing back and L &amp; F number on your site is wrong! Thanks!
63377,67624,@AmericanAir 5342 now I'm stuck here i need to get to elp tonight
63380,67627,I call nobody is available I wait for a call back in which when I answered they still said I had to wait for a representative @AmericanAir
63382,67629,@AmericanAir Somebody did just call me to tell me my flight was cancelled for a second straight day. Who knew MSN to DTW could be so hard.
63388,67635,@united can you provide me the United lost and found phone number for Orlando?
63392,67639,@DeltaAssist Do SkyMiles no longer rollover as part of your new program? Was hoping to get a jump on this year's status...
63396,67645,"Damnit. why does @jetblue apply the change fee when tickets are still within the ""full refund"" time range? Cheaper to just cancel and rebuy."
63397,67646,@AmericanAir yes we did. They just told us to wait. I have a flight to Miami on Wednesday and my house keys are inside my luggage.
63404,67653,@JetBlue Glad investors are happy. What about actual flyers? Too bad. #westillhaveVirginAmerica http://t.co/EdzwndSx17
63406,67655,@united every time I have flown with u it always takes longer to board bc of u NOT letting babies board first
63420,67669,Just been informed by @JetBlue that we don't have a Captain or a First Officer. We take off the 20. What the hell is going on #playinghooky
63421,67670,@united  The suspense is killing us! Are you going to announce the FATE for the Brussels flight SQ2825 any time soon? We're waiting!

63440,67689,It's sad to see the @AlaskaAir mileage balance at 0 for the new year. but the MVP Gold next to my name for 12 more months sure is worth it!
63453,67703,@AmericanAir also lost preck statis on one of tickets. so useless!no boarding announcement so ppl just milling around!Confusion reigns at AA
63460,67711,"@united link on email ""3 days only: Fly to Europe. the Middle East or Africa for less with United"" is not working"

63465,67717,Missed my flight back home with @AmericanAir day kinda ruined not gonna lie
63475,67727,@SouthwestAir My problem arose as a result of traveling with a severe allergy. I was forced to move by a late boarding cat. Pets &gt; Humans?
63476,67728,@united my flight from OKC to Dulles is delayed.   I have a connecting flight to London.  My confirmation is pd75js news?
63479,67731,@AlaskaAir I had baggage issue. Pdx counter was going to send $50 credit via email. Issue on 12/28 but no email yet
63484,67736,@united you would have control over personnel no? Seems like the reason the delay will soon reach 5+ hours. Next time. I'll prob do train.
63486,67738,@VirginAmerica yea I sure fucking hope you got it.

65453,69839,@JetBlue Upset. Paid for more space. JB changed F733 A320 to Embrier and changed my seats to tail without notifying. Downgrading service.
65464,69851,.@SouthwestAir - making dreams come true since I found out I could switch flights on a whim and not pay a PENNY more. #iloveyouSouthwest
65467,69854,Mad props @DeltaAssist for always being there to answer us 
65476,69865,Interesting campaign by @JetBlue using storytelling to address plane etiquette issues head-on: http://t.co/eX9TNDC8C3
65478,69867,@AmericanAir You guys have got to be the biggest fucking joke of an airline. Always a fucking problem while flying with you.
65479,69868,"First time using @AmericanAir...probably my last. They broke my suitcase and exposed my clothing. And all they had to say was ""Sorry"". #smh"

65848,70265,@VirginAmerica Start flying to GRR and I'd love to try you out.
65849,70266,I refuse to fly with @AmericanAir again. I've missed two flights because they can't give me the correct tickets and paperwork.

65914,70332,@AlaskaAir is a disappointment. First They lost my bag flying into Seattle. And then their flight wouldn't fly out cuz of technical probs!
65922,70340,Two hours later.... Still stuck on the plane waiting to deboard at Chicago O'Hare @AmericanAir http://t.co/C3RJroeibz

65929,70347,Gotta love how awful @JetBlue 748 is -- crew allows passengers from back rows to fill luggage bins in rows 6-10 way before those rows board
65931,70350,@AlaskaAir thanks for charging 125$ to change a 200$ ticket. It's bad enough I have to fly for medical. I'll just use Southwest jerks.
65932,70352,@JetBlue two things: one is start flying to Columbus PLEASE. The other is that my TV isn't working on my flight right now and I'm sad.

66008,70434,@AmericanAir is it normal to be on hold for 43 min. to book an IN flight? Usually do everything on line. Are you that understaffed?

66609,71063,@AlaskaAir Can a general (non-status) member cancel a partner award ticket and get the miles returned 60+ days before departure? Any fee?
66613,71067,@AmericanAir any chance flight 2900 is going to leave for Rapid City today?

66650,71104,@JetBlue thanks. It's a pretty serious delay. wrecked a lot of our evening plans.
66664,71120,@AmericanAir you've lost frequent flyers. Heard of British boy w LIFE THREATENING allergy. Why would you treat my son different? #Seriously
66714,71171,@AmericanAir where the heck are my bags??? Today is day 6!!!
66717,71174,If you find yourself stuck at the crappy Eugene airport for more than four hours (thanks @united). hop onto http://t.co/SNAi0ElQke to relax

66752,71210,@DeltaAssist can I use my ecredit towards an award travel booking? I keep trying but it's not working
66754,71212,@DeltaAssist essentially my time and any possibility of an UG or aisle EC seat were wasted. 3 agents. 3 different stories. Now row 21
66757,71215,Groundhog Day. twilight zone. something other than real life; taxing back to gate for mechanical issue @AmericanAir no this can't be true
66763,71221,Last time I fly @united airlines. Botched connections for 25% of passengers on flight. made us all miss connections. #unitedairlines
66768,71226,So stoked to be delayed again by @united airlines.  Seems like everyone I fly UA. I'm stuck.  My kids miss daddy.  #noupgrade
66774,71232,@united Today's nightmare ! Flight 1563 Flying to Venezuela &amp; you left my luggage in Chicago ! so. now i'll miss my connection for tomorrow
66775,71233,And the saga continues....On the phone on hold for over an hr with @AmericanAir no luggage and no call today! http://t.co/h54Z35NKRD
66789,71247,.@SouthwestAir: _Welcome to Boston. we__ve happily lost your bags for you. Sorry for the inconvenience!_
66792,71250,@DeltaAssist Your delay on the Mem-Atl flight DL30 is causing my sister to MISS A ONE YEAR OLD's BDAY PARTY!! No. she can NOT wait till tom.
66793,71251,.@AlaskaAir gate agent in oak tried to get everyone to gate check... And flight not even close to full. Have to stress travelers out more??
66809,71268,After a horrible 7hour Delta delay flying east. I am now right where I need to be in 1F on @AlaskaAir #iflyalaska

66874,71399,@JetBlue my flight time changed. now I'm going to be late for my event in Fl. Why won't you let me leave 2 days earlier? ORH to MCO 3/9/15
66882,71407,The struggle of my @JetBlue MCO flight is real. JFK cancelled then bounce to 11PM LGA. You bet I'm ready for Disney 13.1miles in the morning
66883,71408,@SouthwestAir The bags were all loaded. The problem is your third-party freight weighed too much. Why am I punished for poor planning?
66884,71409,Thanks @AlaskaAir for offering no help in rebooking a missed flight. If I wanted this little help. I would've flown United
66889,71414,@AmericanAir Anxiously awaiting to see HAV as destination on http://t.co/lEhqqONX4G.
66899,71426,Just when I try to leave. #Chicago pulls me back in. Or. just keeps our @AmericanAir flight on the runway for 2hrs.
66902,71429,@AmericanAir we are literally driving in circles on the runway at O'Hare because you don't have a gate for us. #areyoukiddngme #worstairline

66967,71499,@AmericanAir As I said. she IS going to contact you via a letter.  Her return flight (info DMed to you last week) was met with bad staff.
66970,71502,Reasons why I don__t fly @united. Sounds like they owe 13 flight attendants an apology. http://t.co/qVTAqZh5iq Bad airline. even to work for.
66971,71503,Turned in my Property Questionnaire. It's in your hands now @AmericanAir wait. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN YOUR HANDS! #ThanksAMillion #bagnag Day10
66977,71509,@VirginAmerica. stop playing with my money b!

66988,71522,I'm never flying American Airlines again. unanimously whispered everyone at O'Hare. #Traveling #AmericanAirlines @AmericanAir
66990,71524,As a poor college student. I'm obligated to accept ALL FREE FOOD. Thanks @JetBlue I didn't really need all the cookies &amp; water but I accept!
66993,71527,If you guys want to send somebody to the Pullman airport to help all of 20+ people whose luggage you lost that'd be great thanks @AlaskaAir
66996,71531,@united  Flight 1102 tonight from Chicago YOU SUCK!!!
66999,71535,The problem with @SouthwestAir is that most people on their flights need to buy two seats.
67000,71536,Screw you too. @united. http://t.co/uvqeVKQmic
67035,71571,Never flying @united again. What a nightmare trying to leave ORD to MHT. Telling everyone to avoid them. Not even a sorry from the airline.
67056,71593,@united not until we leave Europe in March- but always
67058,71595,Had to sprint like Bolt to make it to my connecting flight. The guys at @AmericanAir held the doors for me. what a god send! #Stress #Miami
67063,71600,@AmericanAir honestly is it a hobby of yours to cancel flights?
67075,71613,@VirginAmerica really wish you flew in/out of Hawaii!  Guess I have to wait till 2016 when I'm in  the Northwest so I can utilize you again.
67076,71614,@SouthwestAir you guys are a bunch of fucks and I'm never flyin with you again
67080,71618,Why. oh why must you hate me so. @AmericanAir ?? Cancelling my flight back home? Low blow. #strandedinNY
67082,71620,@united will you re-contract with SkyWest or should I cancel my united flights? don't want my luggage thrown out just so you can save money
67085,71623,@DeltaAssist probably going to miss connection in Atlanta.  Can I get chat assistance?
67107,71645,Ambulance has to meet us on the Tarmac for a medical emergency. Hope he guys ok. @SouthwestAir #chicago http://t.co/1HehX4qgfl
67109,71647,@united flights been delayed 2 hours because you forgot to heat the plane overnight. I'd call this a circus but that implies entertainment.
67110,71648,@AmericanAir think I may run into a trip in vain situation because of mechanical delay. Will DM my PNR. Can you see if I need to abandon?
67116,71654,Once again @united proves worthless in fixing a problem. Don't leave me stranded with no recourse after you create the problem.
67124,71662,"Well. that's too bad. @JetBlue is going to suck under new management. ""Calculated misery"" is a business model. http://t.co/PUXcFWi0p0"
67126,71664,@AmericanAir how this can be possible . miss all my connections . due to weather
67139,71677,@DeltaAssist why is 2134 from msp to phx delayed today?!?!?
67141,71679,@AmericanAir the fee is the issue. $200 is tough on college students
67145,71683,@JetBlue stuck in Boston - two broken planes trying to get to Nassau - missing our connection #jetblue #fail #vacation
67149,71687,@united flying with us airways was the biggest mistake ever. I can't wait to ALWAYS fly United! _
67153,71691,Incredibly long ticket line for #AmericanAirlines at FLL. @AmericanAir need more staff. Stuck tryin to use a stupid voucher make use easier!
67157,71695,I will never fly @united again after the traveling fiasco that I participated in yesterday. #Joke
67174,71712,@united that's a real piece of shit move firing those 13 attendants . Who were obviously concerned about travel safety . You clearly are not
67177,71715,Every time I fly a different airline. there's a problem. I think it's the universe telling me to stick with you @JetBlue.
67187,71725,@AmericanAir would hope this gets sorted soon. horrendous that this has happened
67225,71766,@AlaskaAir why doesn't a crew member have her travel documents? It says the flight is on time on the app but it is delayed #seattletoboise
67226,71767,Quick. easy flight on @AlaskaAir this am from Seattle to Ketch. Admit I am disappointed in paying for the upgrade. but hubby  leg room.
67231,71773,Love having my 2 best friends visit me in nyc. Except we're waiting for their lost luggage--24 hrs &amp; counting. Thanks @JetBlue. #badvacay
67235,71777,@AmericanAir going to MBJ next month. Going from AMA to DFW with you but have to switch to Delta. Will checked bags be switched to Delta?
67239,71781,@united confusion abounds on 219 from Ord. The plane landed 5 hrs b4 takeoff. Why couldn't you identify fuel pump issue earlier? Grrrr
67241,71783,@united 3rd day flt 787 w window control turned off. It sucks - Dreamliner cave. Never again. Need blue skies. Stop doing that.
67242,71784,Gotta fly home today . Never ever like flying home...should just hop on all the @SouthwestAir flights and keep exploring places!
67245,71788,@DeltaAssist on Dec 20th I applied for your status match program. Told to wait 14 days for response. Still nothing. Any help? SM #9154418603

67286,71829,Ask the other passengers if it's alright to wait for me and use my previous tweet and my name. maybe I know some sympathetic people @united
67291,71834,@united Ops must be having a hard time today. Both flights today have been late.
67293,71836,@united #1102 didn't lv Chicago yesterday due 2 lost crew Today late because of mechanical problems United Sucks
67294,71837,@DeltaAssist I paid extra to fly R/T non stop and Delta killed the flight last min w no reason.should I not be entitled to a refund ?
67303,71846,@JetBlue I was at 9 and I'm waiting for my connection now
67305,71848,@AlaskaAir had no idea that your discount codes expired. if I knew that I would have used it before then. what a shame to lose 125$

67331,71875,So sad to be leaving Seattle right before the big game. @AlaskaAir. can your pilots give us score updates on #HorizonAir flights? :)
67342,71887,@DeltaAssist I know it's a difficult job but no need for rudeness. Woman who dealt with us. Angie. was fab.

67388,71934,Just told we're on @United's newest airplane and guess what it's an uncomfortable piece of shit without any modern amenities.
67400,71947,Shocking. I'm flying @united and I'm delayed. I wonder what their % of flights are on schedule? Sits around 16% when I fly them
67408,71955,@AmericanAir I will most likely have to stay in Dallas overnight even though I called twice asking to switch flights.
67419,71966,@AmericanAir Cancelled tickets bought today. Figured I could cancel without penalty.Then booked same trip. different dates. Am I OK?
67429,71977,I really hope @united gets it together.  Flew with 5 people. three of us still missing luggage.  And missed a whole day of vacation.
67432,71980,This is a shame @united ! Coffee seeping through the bullhead seams. raining down in the magazine holder and puddling http://t.co/KmWF0WkjGo

67919,72495,Sad. Five years with various status lvls on @United. but no more. This DEN baggage problem is just another reason why I opted to change.
67925,72501,@SouthwestAir Hi. I'll never fly you internationally again. Bye.

68831,73452,Really. @united? This promotion is designed for people to miss out. Who books a trip to Japan on that short a notice? http://t.co/GT27fLtWo1

68860,73482,That sinking feeling when you miss @VirginAmerica Silver status by 1.000 points and then they all disappear.
68871,73494,I give up on flying between FAR and ORD with @AmericanAir. The flights are never on time and/or there is a mechanical delay #helloDelta

68939,73564,@JetBlue Might not be a bad reminder. along with the safety warnings to buckle seatbelts. etc.
68945,73570,@AmericanAir any news on Flight AA5394 to Vancouver? Trying to patiently wait for info. but diversions to Seattle are not very convenient.
68946,73571,I paid for an aisle seat bc I'm claustrophobic and have anxiety. This is not fair. I might cry. I've never been so upset with @JetBlue
68954,73579,@VirginAmerica My only complaint is that i wish u flew 2 more places! &lt;3 flying u guys. #vegasbaby http://t.co/yHvpMUMjeY
68965,73590,@AmericanAir waited  78 min for cust rel to ans  call. rep hung up on me. must have been having a tough day. Does anyone see the irony?
68968,73593,@SouthwestAir I have a flight credit from a cancelled flight w/ exp. date of 7/30/15. Do we need to fly by that date. or book by that date?
68981,73607,"the nerve of the Cpt of @united 838 today to say. ""WeCantPushBackUntilEveryoneIsSeated;WE'REAlready3.5HrsLate""... as if thats our fault."
68985,73611,Disappointed at @JetBlue for changing the blue chips to half sweet potato half blue chips
68989,73615,@united is it really worth it when you get in early and we have to stay longer getting a gate? #letdown
68992,73618,@DeltaAssist been a loyal customer for years.  Last few as Platinum SkyMiles member.  Missed hitting Gold by 198 MQMs.  Can you help me out?
68995,73621,Landed at DFW &amp; of course having to wait on the runway for @AmericanAir to find a gate. No biggie. Just have a connecting flight to catch
68996,73622,So upset with @JetBlue
69000,73626,@DeltaAssist running late for DL1374 OAK &gt; SLC. Need to check skis. Will we have issues?
69008,73635,@AmericanAir ppl who don't show up for flights and make us wait while you have to take them out should be punished! No flights for a month!
69012,73639,@AmericanAir after u made us miss a day at an allinclusive you won't let us take an empty earlier flight home. Still #worstairline
69019,73646,@JetBlue Denied Mosaic status due to a technicality! I'm very upset! Time to find a new carrier...
69022,73649,@DeltaAssist hello. what's the rule to have rollover miles? I just lost 58k miles from last year in the middle of a trip :(
69042,73670,Landed 20 minutes early only to be told our gate is occupied. and it will be a 30 minute wait. What a roller coaster ride. @AmericanAir
69044,73672,@JetBlue HUGE TY to your crew at LGB for getting my in my orig flight after a possible 3hr wait to my final des! Missing my orig seat tho :/
69051,73679,@SouthwestAir can't wait until our next flight in March! Luv to fly Southwest!
69052,73680,@united yes. but the first time this happened they did not resolve the issue.  faith they will resolve this time. I am waiting to hear back.
69059,73687,@JetBlue Called to book NEW flights Reno &gt; NYC waited 20mins on phone then cut off in first 10secs of being answered #annoying service
69061,73689,@VirginAmerica - I lost an item on a Virgin plane. The destination airport says to call Virgin. but Fly Virgin can't help. Any suggestions?
69066,73694,If you're still tweeting about how bad @united is. you haven't been paying attention to Twitter all these years. Fool me once__
69071,73699,Ouch @SouthwestAir  paid for early bird check in for tomorrow and got A50. Never been this far back. FLT 586 to RDU tomorrow.
69073,73701,@SouthwestAir #fail #EarlyBird is not worth it. I use to think SW was different now they are just like other airlines.
69082,73710,@VirginAmerica :( MISSED my flight today. price wise. need to re-book on #USAirways. would you match fares so I can stay w/ you? #please
69084,73712,On @united flight in1st class woman next to me puts 6 year old granddaughter on lap to play but mad at me because she got kicked out...
69089,73717,"Ladies first - Unless I'm in front of one in the @SouthwestAir boarding order. Then it's. ""wait your turn lady!"""
69097,73727,@JetBlue It's been a great flight with #flyfi wireless. but why no more #RadioMargaritaville? Oh. and the headphone jack is broken. sadly.
69101,73732,@AlaskaAir  Next time there is fog. dont try to make the flight just cancel the flight unless you knoe for sure you can land safely.
69102,73733,On my flight home on @VirginAmerica! The best way to get back to LA LA Land! But I'm def missing Hogwarts!
69108,73739,Stuck in Dallas airport overnight bc @AmericanAir didn't have another flight going to NYC tonight. after our connecting flight got delayed.

69178,73812,@VirginAmerica SFO fog delay this am but as usual taken care by VA. Love a consistent brand experience. You guys nail it every time.
69185,73819,@AmericanAir OK-how long until they process it? It should be a policy for CR to inform customers directly- would save SO much stress for us!
69191,73825,@AmericanAir #FindDylansLuggage  this shouldn't still be an issue... Get the job done.
69206,73843,Fist bump to @united....got home on time with no travel screw ups.  Could this be the start of a budding friendship #firsttime
69208,73845,@DeltaAssist hey I'm missing my flying blue miles. I flew with you guys but the points still haven't been added. Can you check for me?
69213,73850,@DeltaAssist  He's filled in a claim form and is waiting to get it delivered. Is he eligible for any compensation for the inconvenience?Thx.
69217,73854,@AmericanAir I've been trying to check in since yesterday! Why do you make it so hard for BA ticket holders? Grrrrr

69226,73863,@JetBlue there is no one at your check in/desks at DCA. People have been waiting 30 + min and the line is getting longer.
69234,73871,@DeltaAssist waiting to de-ice at DCA. Short connection at JFK to AUA. Hope we make it! We are heading to AUA for a close friends wedding
69238,73875,Time to switch airline loyalties bc perks from mileage plus card is worthless @united
69240,73877,Again security @AmericanAir terminal a nightmare ths am. only 2 lanes open On time people forced 2 wait as late passengrs get pushd to front
69246,73883,just had @DeltaAssist leave 20 minutes earlier than the departure time on my ticket. Now to walk 20 mins bk to the tix to find new way home
69253,73890,@AmericanAir The changeable fare was thousands more!! I'm frustrated bc $300 is Unreasonable esp when the prob was beyond our control.
69262,73900,@JetBlue your app is #frustrating. Does not recognize my profile or iternary. No dedicated support either :(.
69265,73903,@VirginAmerica Hi there. I'm having issues checking out on your site. Are there any known problems? Thanks.

69277,73917,@united It literally happens every time I fly with you... Perhaps you should learn from your competitors as it never happens with them.
69279,73919,"Flying w/ @united is like stabbing yourself in the foot &amp; when it stops bleeding you think ""oh that wasnt too bad. Next time will be better"""
69282,73922,@DeltaAssist Hi. I had submitted an online complaint Case Number: 14510862 Received: 12/16/14 and followed up on it too but never heard back

69300,73941,Not sure if my legs got longer or the space on this plane got smaller @SouthwestAir
69303,73944,@DeltaAssist I'd like to file a complaint. I've booked a flight directly with Delta. It was carried out by Westjet (why? I wanted delta!)
69305,73946,@AmericanAir  Erroneously booked from CVG/JFK. Locator code KQDWPI. Travel should've departed from CDG. Please cancel and credit 25k miles
69306,73947,Very impressed by @SouthwestAir. cancelled a flight to BWi last minute and in 10 minutes rerouted me to DCA at the same time
69315,73957,@AmericanAir Online check-in not working.  Transferring you to USAIR and nothing happens.
69316,73958,@JetBlue Very upset.  I fly tomorrow and had booked a window seat.  The checkin email came today and there's no set!!!  This is a 2day trip.
69317,73959,@JetBlue  your 800 tel # is down and I have a problem.  Please let me know how to contact you.
69319,73961,The best way to start a flight is with an INCREDIBLY rude flight attendant... Thanks @JetBlue
69322,73964,Waiting for the page to load and show one's boarding position for @SouthwestAir is terrifying.
69323,73965,I'm starting to think that I'm in bad relationship with @AmericanAir #MissedConnections #GateChanges

69721,74385,.@SouthwestAir i got kicked off a flight for having my penis sticking out of my zipper. but it wasn't a penis. it was a hotdog. a snack.
69723,74387,@VirginAmerica and now we are evacuating the plane... #moodlighting NOT working. JFK--&gt;LAX
69730,74394,If you look at my Twitter Feed-You'll see that I don't only complain like most. I put in actual experiences good or bad. @JetBlue was GREAT!
69734,74398,@united You should consider switching the banana brand you serve in the United Club.  Del Monte has a poor track record. #rainforestalliance

70830,75550,@united Fl 1189. I'm ex-GS &amp; 1m miler; delay info poor; repair had to be done 2ce; no beverages offered for 1:30;hot plane;
70831,75551,@DeltaAssist trying to cancel a flight. not sure if I'll be able to apply the fare to another itinerary?
70835,75556,@AmericanAir When can we leave!
70839,75560,Flying @SouthwestAir. kinda missing the old printed timetables. And: plastic. California-shaped boarding passes.
70844,75566,Watching a guy get kicked off my flight to PVR b/c he's intoxicated. The @AlaskaAir crew handled it seamlessly &amp; w/ ease. Kudos! #iflyalaska
70845,75567,Why doesn't @SouthwestAir believe I'm Dr. Ari Ashe. PhD?!? It's not like I claimed to be Lord Ari Ashe as I did in Ocean City. #sad
70853,75576,@VirginAmerica why r u no longer flying out of Philly? __
70860,75583,The only thing that sucks about @VirginAmerica is when you have to fly another airline. Bugatti to Pinto.
70870,75594,Can't wait to get to Florida! #wintervacation @jetblue http://t.co/w0VbtwaLTK
70879,75603,Me+10 ppl watch our @United leave for NRT. Been on many int'l flights and waited for fewer to make connection #Fail http://t.co/1JTEIo9pL1
70881,75606,So disappointed in @VirginAmerica
70884,75609,Based on scheduled flight times. @AmericanAir allows for a little over 30 min delay taking off at LGA. Should be in Dallas very early!
70888,75613,@SouthwestAir YOU GUYS LOST MY BAG AND NOW THAT YOU FOUND IT. YOU GUYS WILL NOT DELIVER IT TO ME I AM SO MAD
70895,75620,Flight further delayed. giant rubber band used for takeoff snapped on first try. Going to try and piggyback onto another plane. &lt;3 @united
70898,75623,SO to @SouthwestAir for having half full flights and not being stingy on the snacks
70902,75628,@JetBlue your app is trash. not user friendly esp w seat selection. also kicked me off when my payment was processing
70914,75640,trying to get to SFO but the plane's brake lights are on. come on @SouthwestAir! My vacation time is limited. I don't want to be stuck here!
70917,75644,@DeltaAssist disappointed with delta today
70918,75645,Feel bad for these @united air hosts/hostesses who have to deal with these ignorant ass passengers on the flight over to the states #animals
70930,75657,"Heading to the Seahawks game from Bozeman decked out in #Seahawks gear. The @AlaskaAir gal says ""Go #Packers"". Oh hell no! #NFCChampionship"
70931,75658,@JetBlue thanks for the credit even though it wasn't your fault on the delay. The crew on 1146 was awesome last night. (1/2).
70932,75659,@AmericanAir two flights this weekend two flights delayed. do better.
70949,75676,Uhoh @united may outsource 28 more airports to outside staff. Now boarding: poor service/snafus/inexperienced staff #avgeek #flyerunfriendly
70952,75679,@united Don't apologize.  Fix it!  This isn't the first issue she's had with your airline.  Many friends feel the same.  You're rep is bad.

71000,75732,@VirginAmerica Had really awful experience on flight today.  Would love to chat to someone about it.
71003,75735,"@DeltaAssist I am really mad at you guys for turning into a Spirit style airline with your ""Basic Economy"" garbage."
71014,75747,@JetBlue we did. but unfortunately we were told we would probably see no compensation. Not sure why though. I will never fly you again.
71019,75753,@SouthwestAir  Hey Guys. I want to fly to ABQ for Presidents Day. It's now $575. Should I wait until Tuesday afternoon?
71020,75754,@AmericanAir Once again I ask - what are you doing about this? Since 12/24 all you have done is promise to look into this and failed.
71025,75759,@AmericanAir has my shoes n shit so now I'm down a Benjamin and a half
71029,75763,@AlaskaAir I was downgraded to Coach on a Paid First ticket because the plane was switched to a Combi. Can u assist w/ compensation?
71031,75765,@VirginAmerica flew with you guys for the first time ever and loved it. Any chance you guys can help with switching a flight?
71034,75768,@AlaskaAir how long #386 delayed?
71036,75770,Another great @JetBlue flight tonight. despite the world's most awful seat mates. PS: The hand soap? Smells like an ocean of awesome!
71040,75774,Confused @united agent when I changed my window to a middle seat. But I flew on that plane here and saw bad sick dude cough all over 20B.
71042,75776,@united rocks!! Small change fee for a missed flight I shall go to the ball!!! #UnitedAirlines 
71045,75779,@JetBlue Claim was filed at airport. Really horrible way to end super long day of travel.
71048,75783,@JetBlue ok  waiting
71053,75788,Sigh. #TSAPreCheck didn't work on my @JetBlue ticket from ROC to JFK. was told my TSA agent that it has not worked for JetBlue tx for 2 days
71055,75790,N9666 747-100 @AmericanAir eventually broken up in Arizona #avgeeks #avgeek http://t.co/XGxQ99vmGB
71058,75794,@JetBlue Do you waive the change or cancel fee if a family member dies and we have to cancel our planned trip to attend the funeral?
71059,75795,@SouthwestAir how the heck did I wind up with B39 when I paid for EarlyBird?
71064,75801,Figures @JetBlue decides to royally screw up on the day of the AFC Championship_thanks guys! Much appreciated!
71065,75802,No. you are not crazy. @united is a terrible airline. http://t.co/lTI2r3d5Nc http://t.co/iOWbOEcknb
71068,75805,@DeltaAssist I've spoken to them and they're confused too. The bags were on the tarmac beside the plane from CDG!!
71078,75816,@SouthwestAir computer glitch delays push back. First time for issue with SW. Guess no airline is immune.
71080,75818,May I present to you @AlaskaAir. the shittiest airline in existence.
71082,75821,I'm trapped in NJ!! Bridges are closed. Looking like I may miss my @JetBlue flight home to boston :(
71083,75822,@JetBlue why the delay and police tape at west palm beach terminal? Lots of people need answers!
71086,75825,@VirginAmerica is making my travel so difficult as a college student. It's not my fault black ice prevented me from getting to the airport.
71088,75827,@AmericanAir and then 2 days later. emails and all on separate flights again!  Grrrr 
71089,75828,@united less than 2 weeks until we fly out to New York with yourselves - can't wait! Our most favourite city in the world!
71091,75830,@JetBlue hey! Don't leave without us flt 1051!!
71095,75834,@VirginAmerica I was going to switch from AA to you guys but so far you've ignored three of my emails for status match. Been over a month.
71108,75847,@SouthwestAir I need help - my carryon was stolen (not lost) - and your baggage office keeps losing my info - 4 days later they done nothing
71111,75850,"@united: Why ""board"" the flight just to make us wait on the cold Tarmac for ten minutes? Terrible. Get organized. http://t.co/A6C7ec09vq"
71121,75862,Look I've been trying to be patient with @united today but yall are dropping the ball. Very disappointed.
71130,75872,@united I submitted my complaint online via the link provided in your earlier tweet and will be mailing a hard copy of my complaint...
71150,75892,Never flying @JetBlue again.
71151,75893,so done with @united dude at the airport knocked my laptop on the ground &amp; broke a piece off of it.
71154,75896,@JetBlue we're losing valuable time at the beach! At least give us something to make up for all the lost time!
71160,75902,US DoT Fines @SouthwestAir  $1.6m for Violating Tarmac Delay Rule. Largest civil penalty so far. Next time? http://t.co/JZofKfQKIA
71162,75904,Never fly @united if you'd like to take off. You'd be better off walking. Or finding a pack mule. Or dating a missed connection on Craiglist
71166,75909,@JetBlue every day! Devastating loss.You have no idea. Irreplaceable things in that bag. Thousands of dollars which I'm sure I'll never see
71173,75916,@united Flying to Vegas alone tomorrow from Heathrow. Look after me please. I hate travelling alone!
71180,75923,@JetBlue yes. received the correct boarding pass and a worse seat
71190,75933,@VirginAmerica Customer service is atrocious. When I fly in the USA again I will certainly NOT be flying with you.
71192,75935,@SouthwestAir so much for your $173 deal prices to last for the entire sale duration....bait &amp; switch much?
71194,75937,.@AlaskaAir is ridiculously (wonderfully) Seattle:they let people wearing Seahawks jerseys board first &amp; play Death Cab as we wait to exit
71200,75943,@SouthwestAir is there any alternative to a very late arrival in GRR? Currently in ATL. Conf FO9EDY
71201,75944,@united I was at the airport since 4am. Checked in and then the wait began...  The message broadcasted - waiting for an air hostess -
71202,75945,@DeltaAssist where can I send a formal complaint to?
71207,75950,@DeltaAssist I've enough of a track record with Delta to say that they are the most annoying in swapping planes and delaying passengers!
71210,75953,When traveling for work. we couldn't possibly leave the company mascot behind. Thanks @virginamerica_ http://t.co/emdC5tincJ
71211,75954,@AlaskaAir yes. Issue resolved. The flight crew filled us in on the delay. And then we flew to PSP. Thank you!
71221,75964,@VirginAmerica just a head up. Im having problems booking your ticket using Google Chrome. Ive to use Firefox/Safrai in the end.
71224,75969,@united we are out time and money and we MISSED our friends reception #lackofcommunication
71226,75971,@DeltaAssist I am booking travel and would like to apply flight vouchers from cancelled travel last year. Who can provide me with voucher#?
71230,75975,@united another $200 change fee per ticket ($600 total) had to cancel last year as my kids spring break was taken away for snow days???
71241,75986,.@JetBlue just switched me to an earlier flight for free at the gate... avoided a 4 hour layover at JFK. I LOVE YOU GUYS. #travelwin
71261,76006,It sounds like at least half of my @united flight is en route to #IBSVegas and #KBIS2015. Should be a heck of a week!
71268,76013,LAX &gt; SEA. @AlaskaAir flight full of Seahawks fans just started buzzing after that onside kick recovery... Giddy anxiety!!
71271,76016,@JetBlue yes - provide a customer service number that doesn't have a 40 minute wait or contact me your self
71274,76019,The @united safety video just made a plane full of Seahawks fans en route to Seattle miss the touchdown! #Seahawks
71279,76025,Shoutout to Susie at @JetBlue- amazing customer service and so friendly! Wedding planning is less stressful because of you!
71280,76026,@united 5 hours late waiting on the plane-changed planes... No launch in site...if we played music like this we would have no job. Careless!
71299,76045,@AlaskaAir -nice gesture sending me that $100 coupon code after inordinate BOI delay last Thursday
71303,76049,My @AlaskaAir flight attendant friend says no. I'm sad.

71352,76101,@SouthwestAir yah except I got to type in my credit card and then oh sorry! Vendor is unavailable.  So disappointed.
71353,76102,Does @SouthwestAir save money. time. hassle by having open seating? It just seems insane. #run #push #yell #getarrested #missyourflight
71364,76114,@AmericanAir first time flying with AA and I may be stuck at LAX overnight b/c of broken plane. Need to work tmr. please help
71366,76116,Flight home on @AlaskaAir not as great as the first - about a 1/3 of the plane had to check bags and running late - not impressed
71371,76121,@DeltaAssist If I redeem a travel voucher on http://t.co/hbAoEiBvkB then cancel within 24 hours. will the value go back onto the voucher?
71373,76123,@SouthwestAir not loving the fact that you are letting a plane with known power/mechanical issues take off from Nashville to Chicago
71374,76125,Shoutout to @SouthwestAir for streaming CBS &amp; Fox. Didn't miss a snap of today's playoff action.
71376,76127,@AlaskaAir they did not do anything but give us a $12 voucher for food. No credit for missing vacation time. :(
71382,76133,@united what happened to service? Wont accept meal request over phone 20h before flight. Done during online checking in before. Never a prob
71389,76141,@united flight 1526 from ewr to lax. No in flt entertainment. First class absurd! Shameful

71406,76159,@JetBlue actually that isn't the issue I am understanding of a flight delay that wasn't the case this morning
71420,76174,@SouthwestAir-really disappointed in RT delay of ~3 hrs. Happens toomuch.Virgin &amp; United ~8pm SAN-&gt;SFO left on time. Losing loyalty fast.
71422,76176,Watching this show #Airline makes me never want to fly @SouthwestAir. It's like #HungerGames fighting for a seat on their flights. #Ratchet
71423,76177,@JetBlue flight 915 had engine problems. crew bails because they feel unsafe and all we get is free chips? #horribleservice
71424,76178,Ok @JetBlue I've officially been waiting 45min with no signs of any bags from the flight. Never had this with any other airline.
71429,76183,They're the ones who fucked up and I (literally) have to pay for it. Thanks @VirginAmerica
71430,76184,@DeltaAssist confirmation code is HYJDXO. I need to delay my flight to the day after. same time.

71815,76591,@JetBlue Kinda terrifying that a couple problems have been found w/this plane + costing your passengers $ trying to figure out what to do.
71818,76595,Can someone explain to me why people wait in line to board airlines that have preassigned seating?? (I.e. All but @SouthwestAir). #linessuck
71821,76598,There was the sexiest flight attendant on my flight today. yo @SouthwestAir has a homie flyin mad real
71822,76599,@JetBlue Sure.  Just seems all to common with your airline.  Always late or delayed for mechanical reasons.
71825,76602,End of an era. Crammed spaces and fees. Now youre just be one of the other airlines america hates.no longer my preferred airline.  @JetBlue
71829,76606,@SouthwestAir Glad to see you're paying attention. This is a long-standing problem that plagues most (if not all) of your flights.
71832,76609,@SouthwestAir . trying to make a reservation &amp; been on hold forever !!!
71833,76610,@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for 32 minutes hoping to apply credits expiring today to a new res. Keep holding?
71838,76615,@JetBlue Explain this: 7:55pm flt from MCO to EWR delayed til 9:57 PM so far BUT  9:20pm flt from MCO to EWR on time. #unhappycustomer
71854,76631,@JetBlue  Sad that i can't fly you anymore for my cross country trips.  Need you guys in the Ohio Valley! #SDF #CVG #IND
71860,76637,Would you rather be evacuated from an airport terminal or stuck on the plane waiting for evacuation to end? At least I chose @JetBlue
71864,76642,@united 2nd flight today delayed by lack of crew.  UA1106 out of MSP. now UA6505 2hrs late. what's up? Sounds like poor resource management!
71872,76650,is @SouthwestAir phone support just broken today or always at least a 45 minute wait only to be hung up on? If web doesn't work phone should
71881,76660,@SouthwestAir assured us that our connecting flights would be held for 10-15 minutes so we could make them. Now stuck in Chicago. 
71884,76663,@SouthwestAir how do you allow too many passengers to board an airline? Flight 529 has too many passengers. We were suppose to leave at 8:45
71907,76689,I am pretty upset this plane didn't have cheese nips... @AlaskaAir
71919,76702,Big thanks to all the douchenozzles on this @JetBlue flight who don't know what a carryon actually is. Now I have to wait to get my bag

71929,76712,Flying from LAX to HK tomorrow! Fingers crossed no luggages will be lost!! @AmericanAir
71932,76715,@jetblue For seasoned travelers. ur issue w #tsaprecheck numbers disappearing from profiles is frustrating. Agents should do more to resolve
71941,76724,@AmericanAir seems to be an issue though - status wasn't shown in US Air on Sunday too!
71943,76726,@DeltaAssist what do we do if we are late to our connection in Detroit.  We are on the runway awaiting de ice.
71950,76734,@united I'm going to miss my flight UA4486 because the 30 minutes i slotted to get through terminal A security at EWR was not enough.
71956,76740,@DeltaAssist hi! I have a problem with the reservation #GACWPN. Some flights appear 2be cancelled
71957,76741,The greatest issue facing Americans today? A lack of overhead bin space. Ponder that. @AmericanAir That's some real deep stuff for your AM.
71962,76746,UK couple ask @united airline passengers to help look for lost New York marriage proposal pics http://t.co/wPjFFEw3Qu http://t.co/XNDy5zDwav
71964,76748,@AmericanAir is king of screwing ppl today. Lost tickets. bad planes. broken TVS...    Direct from Seoul to DFW turns into a 4 stop flight!
71966,76750,@AmericanAir Don't fly with AA if you need to transport a stroller. They broke my stroller and only apologised! Shameful. AAstrollerbreakers

72055,76849,@AmericanAir Why can't I put on hold tickets anymore? Only seems to work if booking with miles. not on all type of flights :(
72057,76851,@AlaskaAir We just got our vouchers. Thanks for making a terrible situation right. We appreciate it.
72060,76854,Never realized how truly incredible @SouthwestAir is until I flew a different airline. #luvsouthwest #luvrapidrewards #happycustomer

72265,77072,Hate flying north on any other airline that isn't @AlaskaAir . Watching the fares for a flight to Seattle like a hawk.
72267,77074,@united  million miler.  platinum elite.  25k+ annual spend in 2014.  Means NOTHING to United.  Screwed by UAL 3x in last week.
72269,77076,@united Anything you can tell about 1740 DEN to IAD? If I miss my connection to FRA I don't get to see my husband who I haven't seen 3 mnths
72273,77081,delayed flights  @JetBlue http://t.co/rxkAkxuVFK

72324,77134,Mother eff. Supposed to leave SFO at 4:10 ... still here and it's now 6:20. @VirginAmerica - free flight out of this?!
72329,77140,@americanair. pregnant wife run through the O__Hara airport only to make us miss TWO flights due to neglect from your staff.
72339,77151,I am strongly concerned with @united decision to cancel yxe-den service.  I'm hopefully this will be reversed.
72343,77155,No wifi. but live State of the Union on TV - I'll take it. Thanks @JetBlue! (but wifi would be cool in the future?)
72344,77156,@JetBlue not on time actually. Emergency landing in FLL after lvg PBI to EWR. actually 3hrs late! http://t.co/cNk3LZp6rv
72355,77167,Everybody was super helpful today traveling EXCEPT for the peeps at @VirginAmerica ORD check-in; so disinterested- couldn't be bothered.
72357,77169,@united I was on the road 265 days in 2014. &amp; most of those flights were on UA. It seems 1K status is worthless. as CLE has been abandoned.
72361,77173,Didn't miss a beat. Thx @VirginAmerica Would be awesome though if it didn't fully mute audio feed when PA comes on  http://t.co/GaxiCHUnjb
72369,77181,@JetBlue am talking about check in for luggage. 50 people waiting on line
72370,77182,You might have paid some attention in 2011. or maybe 2012. 2013?   No wait. definitely 2014! @united too late. &gt;&gt; http://t.co/HXgzSOi3vS
72379,77193,@AlaskaAir is the worst tonight
72380,77194,@AmericanAir is holding us hostage #5387. 1st landed in Austin. 2 hrs. Now ushered off plane. Won't cancel so they don't have to put us up
72382,77197,@DeltaAssist Does Delta give gate passes to military travelers? So family can see us at the gate before we leave
72385,77200,@united having problems with your website? I can find my reservation on iOS app. but not on the web.
72388,77203,Oh @SouthwestAir. if a flight is 100% late and 0% on-time. your schedule is literally just a lie! http://t.co/ZP79Ly9evB
72391,77206,I love @JetBlue  but third flight in a row with mechanical trouble.  Do you guys just put it in garage and hope it's starts like I do?
72394,77209,@DeltaAssist have never flown first class before. Leave Cancun Friday to come home is this an option to upgrade to?

72406,77221,@AmericanAir what's your biggest fear
72411,77226,Gonna ask how accommodating @virginamerica is about noisy flights. my previous favorite airline compensated us for being trapped w noisy ppl
72414,77229,@JetBlue I've never had airline actively try to prevent me from booking a flight. I guess the next step is cutting up my JB AMEX card
72426,77242,Shoutout to @united for ruining my whole day with your crappy delayed flights 
72431,77247,@DeltaAssist I'm a United 1K. looking to switch to Delta. sent in status match request &amp; e-mailed info and didn't get a reply. Can you help?
72436,77253,@AmericanAir we are trapped on a Tarmac in MIA flt 1101-about to miss Flt 318-please advise
72443,77260,.@JetBlue I fear he's cancelled his return trip from SFO to JFK and switched to #VirginAmerica. I understand his consternation.
72444,77261,@JetBlue Fl 395 once again-JB can't agree on departure time. It was pushed back one hour at 7am-then it wasnt &amp; wait for it-it was
72446,77263,@DeltaAssist New iPhone app is much too slow to load. Don't need bells/whistles - need FAST access to boarding pass and itinerary.

72734,77576,I have never been more pleased with an airline as much as I am with @SouthwestAir
72735,77577,WFT is up with canceling the flights to YQR &amp; YXE? You do realize these cities are booming?! Just another reason to HATE @united #ASSCLOWNS

73572,78461,@VirginAmerica hey vx23 to SFO flight computer is broken and we are delayed!!! Can you make me a little more comfortable while I  wait?
73577,78466,@united the best wake up call came today from Molly at Lost &amp; Found in Houston- my iPad was recovered and is now in route back to me!
73579,78468,Very bad experience w/@SouthwestAir representatives. After 20 years. we will never fly that airline again. Hope $89.10 is worth it. #SWA.
73584,78473,I have an issue with @AmericanAir reservation and need to get it resolved. I called the reservation number 433-7300 for over 20 mins.
73590,78479,I CANNOT BELIEVE I MISSED @JETBLUE $32 FLIGHTS TO TRINI YESTERDAY____
73592,78482,@AlaskaAir look at the page. Humberside police are murderer's. its on Facebook. It's disgusting what's happening to this guy. retweet
73595,78486,Hey @JetBlue issue a fee waiver for a flight change into JFK. I'm not trying to die tomorrow afternoon. Thanks in advance!
73597,78488,@united How come I cannot view today's tracking information for yesterday's massively delayed UA383?
73605,78496,My moms flying @AmericanAir Sunday morning. Very nervous with the anticipated Snow she will be delayed and miss a wedding she has that day
73608,78500,@united Question: where can I leave a comment re: an employee? We had fabulous service &amp; want to acknowledge her.
73619,78511,@united takes a $1bn hit on fuel hedges.  But is the new posture too little too late? #Airlines http://t.co/xcV8pF3lJ2
73621,78513,@AmericanAir Expedia. Hipmunk showing $83 OW LAX-SFO on 1/28. United. Virgin same price. But AA fare is fake. others real. Bait and switch?
73624,78516,@JetBlue thanks. I'm refreshing the page every 5 minutes waiting. I have my eye on a flight out tonight but can't do anything yet.
73633,78526,@JetBlue my new favorite airline. They didn't fight me bringing my guitar on board. or give me the broken tv. . Keep up the good work.
73634,78527,@DeltaAssist Web and Delta app say a Platinum Medallion has Lounge access in BOM (opperated by Clipper). Not the case. very disappointed.
73637,78530,@AlaskaAir We faxed them over an itemized list of the contents/valuation of the lost luggage yesterday. I hope they find it.
73646,78539,@JetBlue My flight just got delayed. Fort Lauderdale to JFK Flight #402. Will be at the airport soon - any chance there's an earlier one?

73655,78548,.@JetBlue THAT FLIGHT I JUST TOOK FROM LA GUARDIA TO FORT LAUDERDALE WAS PURE HELL ON EARTH!
73670,78563,@AmericanAir you guys realize time is money. so ask $75 to change to earlier flight - and don't fly on time??? 2449 is ONE hour late!
73679,78572,Flew @JetBlue and they gave me my bag back completely ripped w no answer to me complaints #boycott http://t.co/BfIEoBabB8
73682,78575,@SouthwestAir why is it that all I hear on here is how unhappy everyone is. I'm flying on southwest 1st time in April and getting nervous
73683,78576,@AlaskaAir why do you always cancel the mid-afternoon GEG-SEA?!

73715,78610,@DeltaAssist dl6438 from lax. This delay literally means I won't see my kids tonight - will now miss my shuttle home.

73740,78635,.@AlaskaAir The difference in fare makes sense and a change fee of $50- $75. but $200+ is disgraceful. I'll never book #AlaskaAir again.

73925,78832,everyone should try flying @VirginAmerica. have you seen their security/on boarding video? fucking amazing.
73930,78837,@AmericanAir why's it more expensive to travel out of the US than in to it.  on the Same exact routes???? The hell game y'all playing? &gt;=(
73932,78839,The real question is why @JetBlue cancelled my flight when there's not a single flake of snow on the ground #sad
73947,78854,@JetBlue on flight1922 to Boston later. Still not canceled what time would u cancel. if so I need to rebook asap
73948,78855,Flight home from JFK is delayed not due to the snow but because the co-pilot is late to work. @VirginAmerica #BeOnTime #virginamerica
73955,78863,Credit @united for finding a way to maximize their profits and the number of miserable customers per flight :( #Cramped #EconomyPlusEmpty
73960,78868,@DeltaAssist - have an large issue.  Rollover MQMs came through TREMENDOUSLY incorrectly.  Please PM me.

74000,78909,@AmericanAir delaying because of deicing. Does it look like that layover will be affected/can you ensure me the LA plane will wait?
74009,78918,Can't lie. I like the retro design on @AlaskaAir. http://t.co/aC6i5b6qHk
74010,78919,@JetBlue Been there. Done that.  Could have left Fri. Very bad alternatives for Sun. GREEDY JetBlue.
74016,78925,@united yes its easy__just look at http://t.co/XoKUDbMXoq and copy what they do. everything about your design. IA. look and feel is bad.
74020,78929,@SouthwestAir  Pilot said connecting flights would wait but they did not. Seriously - they could not wait 5 minutes.  Truly disappointing
74022,78931,@AlaskaAir Like seriously???????? My Baggage since 3 days ago!!!! Last place I saw it was in #Seattle. #PissedPassenger Not good enough

74095,79008,@DeltaAssist tried to book seats so my 7 yr old could sit with me. was told it could not be done. I'd have to try switch.
74096,79010,@DeltaAssist I did call you. You told me to wait 24 hours. It's like you protect my miles better than Ft. Knox protects gold.
74101,79017,Thank you @JetBlue for always being so helpful and wonderful. So relieved to reschedule my flight. no charge or hassle. bc of bad weather!
74111,79027,@JetBlue Hi. where is the SkyMall catalog? I am sad that flight 1171 does not have SkyMall. Where is SkyMall. :(
74113,79029,@AlaskaAir too late Andre
74118,79034,Ever since airlines have been switched from @AlaskaAir to horizon in alaska. It's almost not even worth wasting gas to go to the airport..

74142,79059,@virginAmerica so far not impressed with the handling of my lost bag. You have it but next scheduled delivery isn't until 6? #travelissues
74143,79060,Reason #492 never to fly @AmericanAir: they insist on checking carryon bags that all other airlines accept. :(
74145,79062,My day is made better by funny announcements on @SouthwestAir. There may be 50 ways to leave your lover. but only 6 ways off this plane...
74149,79066,Still highly disappointed in @JetBlue's management of their sale the other day. missed out on a trip to LA away from this snow 
74158,79076,This @VirginAmerica flight smells like Elmer's glue. On-board crafts or unfit for flight?
74163,79082,@DeltaAssist hi I have an issue

74265,79188,So much for Swiss efficiency. Stuck in a non-moving line @united in Zurich airport.
74280,79203,Looking forward to first ever @AmericanAir flight later - a shame that their 'silver birds' no longer grace the skies...
74287,79211,@AmericanAir 5 weeks today and we will be flying with you for the first time to LA . we can't wait :-)_

74342,79270,So grateful to the @AmericanAir staff for holding onto my credit card.  It would have been a very bad day without their help.

75310,80276,thanks @JetBlue for cancelling my flight. moving my flight without my permission. and screwing up my whole schedule! #JFK to #ROC.
75311,80277,"Oh how I miss my ""A"" status on @SouthwestAir!! Heading out to the balmy northeast today. I must be nuts."
75314,80281,Really pissed at @JetBlue right now. Had to change my flight to wed&amp;they email me now saying im going to leave Thursday w/out explaining why
75319,80286,I have a feeling I will be on hold with @JetBlue trying to rebook my flight to NYC as long as it would take to fly there. Dang you Juno!
75325,80292,@SouthwestAir maybe you shouldnt fill flights so much that passengers can never store their carry-ons anywhere near them. #justsaying
75326,80293,Gosh! there is no advantage to being a @united platinum member. Insane lines on monday mornings at the premier security lane.. #consulting
75333,80300,@united my mom lost her conection flight from houston to nreark. nj. Is there any more flights coming this way?
75334,80301,Not even having a row to myself can outweigh the disappointment of @JetBlue  not having chocolate chip cookies on my flight.
75335,80302,Had the best time in NYC this weekend. Hoping our 2pm flight on @united doesn't get cancelled.
75337,80304,@JetBlue is the 425 flight from Orlando to laguardia tomorrow cancelled? Nothing is showing up online.
75343,80310,@AmericanAir I've been waiting on a call back since this tweet
75345,80312,@Jetblue #jetbluejfk Nothing like a flight delay because the crew refused to fly to Rochester!

75354,80322,. @JetBlue I have a Wednesday flight from #BOS... why no fee waiver on changes? MassPort says no flights until Thursday. #Juno #travel
75362,80331,Been sitting on this @AlaskaAir plane at SNA for 45 min waiting for repair. Of course they play music that you'd expect to hear when you die

75383,80355,I've been on hold with @AmericanAir for 2hrs 30mins. Best way to spend your last day of vacation in South America!!  (end sarcasm)

75403,80375,thx @JetBlue for cancelling my flight &amp; vacation while other airlines took off today. plane getting stuck more important than customers?
75424,80397,@americanair I always go thru some bullshit with you guys ... This the last time ... I'm sticking to Virgin Airlines

75551,80528,Thanks @jetblue for refunding my ticket today. Stuck in New England with the storm.  Your rep was helpful and friendly.  Very easy.
75555,80532,@AmericanAir Always a crapshoot whether your planes will work. I guess one out of two isn't bad #nocheapflights
75559,80536,@VirginAmerica you guys. i can't stay mad. LA sun   &gt; NYC bitter
75568,80545,This @JetBlue flight attendant is a Muslim and it's awesome (Hijab and all)! Kicking #Islamophobia to the curve one person at a time!

75577,80554,I know the purists hate it. but I'm fond of the new @AmericanAir livery. It says boldly we are AMERICAN - #avgeek http://t.co/iZMyvt1BGh
75578,80555,.@SouthwestAir brought back honey roasted peanuts. Is it sad that this realization may be the high point in my day?#SmallThingsInLife
75582,80559,@DeltaAssist Q: have you already cancelled flights out of PVD on Wednesday AM? I need to get to MCO by Wednesday PM for a flight to UK
75583,80560,There is no song more soul-crushing than the country hold-music on @VirginAmerica 's 877 number. Excuse me while I go rock in a corner.

75711,80697,@JetBlue do you all know if you'll be cancelling flights on Wednesday and Thursday as well do to the snow storm. I fly into JFK Thursday.
75712,80698,@DeltaAssist hello. DL345 took off from TPA at 1215 for LGA-now we're in Albany. If we don't leave soon we're stuck here for days. Solution?
75732,80718,Seems like everyone is having a bad day. At least I'm not @united who keep messing shit up. _

75758,80745,Don't bother with silly taxi vouchers @united is offering stranded EWR passengers. Drivers won't accept them.
75762,80751,@AmericanAir even if there wasn't a winter storm. you would be canceling or delaying flights 
75764,80754,@AmericanAir came in on CX but they claim AA will not allow them to issue boarding pass.  If AA sells connections. they should be open
75767,80757,@SouthwestAir turns out you guys are like everyone else with regards to redeeming miles #restrictions #disappointed #corporateculture
75768,80758,Dear Snow. I hate you. Dear @AlaskaAir thank you for the full refund. http://t.co/sdZiRNc5Mv #blog #Blizzard2015

75783,80774,Huge kudos to @AlaskaAir for getting me home ahead of storm when other (unnamed) airlines failed
75789,80780,@SouthwestAir No apology or accommodation from any staff. Arrive at 3:33 for 3:35 departure and they don't allow us on. Now a 4hr wait
75791,80782,Sad that @JetBlue has basically only one flight heading east today from LAX and the crew can't get to work on time. #singlehubsarebadideas

75820,80813,@AmericanAir anyone following this account I urge you to call the FAA and make a complaint if this whole fiasco has been as bad as mine has.
75821,80814,@JetBlue Hang in there friends! Weather happens. Nothing we can do but wait it out. Stay strong &amp; see you Friday (pending the next storm)
75823,80816,This @VirginAmerica flight has a similar ambience to a vodka bar. Too bad the other passengers aren't as drunk as I am.
75828,80821,@VirginAmerica I'm flying DCA&gt; DAL tomorrow evening. Think I'll have a problem?
75830,80823,@SouthwestAir excuse me I just took a big shit in your toilets and it's not flushing

75840,80834,@united I have to say. I was really unhappy that I missed my connecting flight. got stuck in Chicago with no $$.. And almost didn't make it
75848,80843,Oh @JetBlue. I know I'm mad at you for taking away first checked bag....but when are you getting Mint on Boston routes?!?

76294,81304,My flights got changed and @AmericanAir took the MD-80 off my route. It's why I chose those times of day. I'm missing stuff for nothing.
76299,81309,@DeltaAssist I had an issue with my baggage today and it was very upsetting. Why did this happen?
76300,81310,@AlaskaAir still waiting on my free flight from when u lost all my stuff for a week...
76303,81313,Any word on status of delay for @united 197?  Mechanical? #whenwillweleave
76306,81316,@VirginAmerica LAX lounge staff were beyond amazing tonight -- so patient &amp; kind despite staying later to accommodate delayed flight!

76384,81404,Puerto Rico I am coming. Can't wait to fly out @JetBlue  can't wait to have your blue chips :)
76392,81414,@JetBlue Not a bad way to watch the sunrise! Thanks for the ride!
76403,81427,@SouthwestAir. why suggest that I switch flights. and then steal my EarlyBird boarding? It's paid for. honor it!  #SWAbadservice #noLUV
76405,81429,@DeltaAssist argh. why can i never use my upgrade certificates? 4 certificates that will expire since i can't use them. too late for miles?

76425,81449,I'm going to lose my Gold status with @AmericanAir! So sad. I wish I had the $650 to keep it. Or I should have traveled more.  #SadDay
76428,81452,@DeltaAssist I missed gold by $61 for 2015. I've been gold for years. I've called and faxed trying to solve this with no help/response.
76429,81453,@united btw your IVR doesn't support an inbound Skype call or some other issue
76434,81458,Paid more money to take a connecting flight &amp; switched back to economy from first cause of a storm that never happened THNX @AmericanAir

76453,81478,@JetBlue Hi. I have a problem to inform by MD.
76454,81479,.@AmericanAir how do I get the Oxygen mask to come out? The guy next to me smells like his body is the key ingredient in a shit sandwich.
76455,81480,@AmericanAir how long do I wait? Is this timeframe usual? Reasonable? Systematic?
76456,81481,. @VirginAmerica. there's nothing more evil than offering CANNED TUNA on yr menu. the stench of my seatmate's lunch awoke me from my slumber
76463,81488,I miss you @JetBlue!!! Hope all is well :) Trip.  Soon.  Yes.
76465,81490,@AmericanAir is it normal to wait over four months for help? I have a PLATINUM card with you guys and still I wait for some help. WHY???
76469,81494,Thank you to @VirginAmerica for making things right for me after an seating issue. #stillloyal
76470,81495,@AmericanAir Can we teach people to leave room in overhead bins for the bulkhead rows? You had me holding up the line looking for space.
76473,81498,Last flight-freezing. today-yelled at by stewardess! Considering how much I travel. maybe I need to avoid booking @SouthwestAir #frustrated
76483,81508,@AlaskaAir - any idea when 2015 G75 packets will be mailed out? My wife got her MVP but I'm still waiting.
76484,81509,@JetBlue Its fantastic. Your extra room seats. snack boxes. and movies take the stress out of traveling. Thank you!
76485,81510,@AmericanAir a certificate with an expiration date is not a resolution for 2 broken planes.that requires me to spend $ #condenast #refunds

76510,81537,@JetBlue surprised me with my notebook that I thought was lost forever #howthoughtful http://t.co/w5LmfNq5Mh

76730,81764,@AmericanAir If ppl can't drive cars more than 10 years old you should have us fly in planes that are. This McDonnell Douglas is awful.
76735,81770,@JetBlue do you see any issues with travel on Sat. morning out of Boston? We are to get another 2-4 inches of snow.

76768,81806,I haven't even stepped onto my flight yet and I already hate @united. Say you can't check-in without scanning your passport FROM THE START!
76769,81807,Updated: @united emergency landing at Ontario airport. Passengers on flight 1181 reporter burning smell. No injuries. http://t.co/bncAsoEkne

76773,81812,@DeltaAssist who do I contact to switch my flight tomorrow?
76776,81815,@united come on guys. don't hold us in the penalty box for 30 min only to pull us up to the gate and wait another 15 for a guideman

76814,81855,On a new A319 w/ only 8 FC seats. It's clear that @AmericanAir no longer values loyalty. #NewAmerican
76816,81857,@AlaskaAir What is the delay for AS580 for PDXSNA today?  I have clients excited about Disneyland and they haven't gotten any info!
76819,81860,@SouthwestAir True. Safety first! I just don't want to leave Vegas any sooner than I have to.
76827,81870,According to http://t.co/bAqxdj5iF9 the DC-bound @United flight is expected leave from ONT soon. http://t.co/vGrZxg7eTW
76828,81871,great customer service from @VirginAmerica on some missing points. Thanks!
76834,81877,Never had an issue with @SouthwestAir - can't say the same for any other domestic carrier &amp; I fly weekly #TNI
76841,81884,@AmericanAir is there any way to confirm that my receipts have been received? Worried that they are still waiting
76844,81887,@JetBlue - why is it so slow on true blue??? All the tim
76847,81890,@JetBlue nice flight from Jacksonville. Little delay but easy flight. Yay
76849,81892,Sorry @United but $12000 PQD for 1K status in 2016 is unacceptable what's next for 2017? 15k?!  gotta jump ship sayonara from this 1K sorry

76879,81924,@united Board says that UA3892 left. but we haven't. 'Pilots stuck in traffic'. Poor #CustomerService http://t.co/ra79dpKRGA
76886,81931,Thanks @AlaskaAir for the great treatment after a missed flight! :D
76888,81933,I have never felt so much like just a number @SouthwestAir and so not cared about. Never flying with them again
76890,81935,@United excuse: crew was stuck in traffic (unlike everyone else on the plane who planned ahead and made it on time) #UA3892
76893,81939,@united never been on an on time flight from Boston to IAD. Switching to jet blue
76902,81948,You must be joking. Half boarded and then they tell us the pilot isn't here. Delayed and now I'm likely to miss my connection. @AmericanAir
76903,81949,Come on @AmericanAir DFW operations!  Having planes sit and wait on occupied gates because it's easier for you? Bad job.
76907,81954,The girl at the airport would not let me switch my flight from lb to Oakland from SF. Love the @JetBlue but Raider haters? :( #bay
76915,81962,Missing @united today.  Stuck on crappy 40 year old plane on AA.  I mean seriously. how can this thing still fly?  Blah.
76926,81973,Flying @AmericanAir tonight. I better not be disappointed.

76957,82004,Ireland. me and my grandfather were planning a trip but he passed away due to cancer and we never had the chance @JetBlue #FlyingItForward

77286,82348,3hr delay awaiting a flight crew to arrive for a short haul flight? :( Not the @VirginAmerica I luv. Feels like another crew was needed.
77288,82350,@AlaskaAir SEA-SJC flight delayed 1.5hr. seats free SFO routing and you want to charge me $180 diff?  Guess MVP Gold not worth much!
77289,82351,I'm gonna miss you. @united 1K. Sniff.
77291,82353,@AlaskaAir only problem is that we still haven't taken off. _ still can't dampen our spirit #GoHawks

77309,82371,@JetBlue flight 1117 from LGA to TPA was supposed to leave at 330. It is now 90 min later and we are #10 in line to take off

77335,82401,@AlaskaAir Your flight attendants look ridiculous in 12th man gear. Do they going to dress up for Easter too? Little bunny tails and ears?

77380,82450,@AmericanAir  one of the airline stewardesses  must be having a bad day on flight #5416 lax to Houston?
77381,82451,Not looking forward to -26 at the house. Waiting for @AlaskaAir 2807 plane to get fixed. Not boarding as app says. Better safe than sorry!
77387,82457,I thought my @SouthwestAir flight was going to leave on time today. but apparently people are allowed to board after takeoff time now?!
77395,82465,@AmericanAir yr 3+ hr flight delay because of mechanical error is causing me to miss a show for which I have tix. How'll you compensate me?

77418,82489,@VirginAmerica Why are there never any deals from JFK-&gt;LAX???
77421,82492,@SouthwestAir what's the reason for the delay on flight 3400 out of san jose
77422,82493,Really wishing @AlaskaAir still had service to LGB. SNA flight crammed full and leaving late.
77426,82497,Second time flying @united. second time w/ incredible delays + (maybe) missing connecting flight. Avoiding them like the plague in future.
77427,82498,Disappointed so often by @SouthwestAir. They cancel and reschedule flights so frequently out of SJC. http://t.co/srkxrnkioF
77436,82507,.@VirginAmerica always a pleasure. It's been a couple of months. I missed you dearly. #travel
77439,82511,My job told me last night finally. uber late of vacation day. Looked at flights home by @AmericanAir &amp; not bad. Looked today. Up $2.000 #fml

77484,82561,@JetBlue I love you and all. but this delay sucks! What's the deal??
77488,82565,@AlaskaAir Any idea what the heck is going on in Anchorage? Several flights cancelled. no real plan moving forward. Chaos here.
77501,82579,@JetBlue what happened to you? #disappointed #usedtobesogood #travelnightmare
77503,82581,@United when you know my bag hasn't made it on the plane with me. how bout at least a courtesy text so I don't have to wait at the carousel?
77509,82587,@DeltaAssist yes. I don not have any problems to log in. but when I was cheking in in UK. I couldnot request the miles of my flight for this
77510,82588,@AlaskaAir Flight 3490 to Fresno is delayed 2+ hours out of Seattle. Can't seem to find out why. Any idea? Thanks!
77521,82599,Ugh. Was still in the air when my connecting flight to Austin took off early. And @united rebooked me on a flight at 5:30pm tomorrow. :(
77526,82604,Thanks @JetBlue for giving me a flight with broken tv's both ways for my vacation. never flying with you again.
77528,82606,Excuse me @AmericanAir the passenger im setting next to is upsetting me. Could I please move to a different seat? http://t.co/bHbOAh9KtA
77529,82607,@AmericanAir we need to chat. What's the best way for a non-aggressive customer complaint?
77536,82614,Can I have just one flight where I'm not delayed in some way? Dang. #stillloyal  @AlaskaAir
77538,82616,. @united guess you guys missed the sarcasm. That's ok your sarcasm radar is still better then your airline.
77541,82621,So tht moment you're face down in the airport carpet at 2am because @AmericanAir lost your bag &amp; filed the claim wrng http://t.co/RhBvBJAFJH
77561,82643,My @SouthwestAir flight boards in 15 mins for Pittsburgh. I'm hoping it's on time since I was delayed 3 hrs going &amp; 2 hrs coming last time.
77563,82645,@DeltaAssist can you please wake up our Captain #DL6288. He is late!!!
77573,82657,Hey @united you had one job. and you screwed up. Too bad ctrl alt delete didn't fix your fuel gauge and I miss my flight around the world.
77576,82660,Nothing like a cup of water to pass the repair time before a series of @united flights are missed on our Bali trip. #delay #united
77577,82661,@JetBlue The Click Here link for rebooking out of BOS for Linus is broken. Can't rebook online with waiver of fee.
77578,82662,@DeltaAssist I just upgraded AMX cards. will Delta issue me a Sky Club card or do I just use my Reserve card for entry? Sorry random ?'s
77580,82664,@SouthwestAir how long ahead of departure do I have to cancel so that a WannaGetAway fare is reuseable?
77581,82665,The boarding process at @AmericanAir is inefficient and slow. Too many classes and layers of flyers. Simplify it.
77583,82668,Goddammit @united. Why walk me through your change flight process if it will fail at the end? Happens too often.
77586,82672,Not mad about this early flight anymore #complimentaryupgrade #1k @united
77588,82674,@AmericanAir zero response from the lost and found email at DFW. I've sent a follow-up email this morning just to make sure they've rcvd
77589,82675,So now on hold with @AmericanAir to see if I can get out of Chicago later tonight...or else I'm gonna be stuck. I know it.
77599,82686,@united stuck waiting for gate at lax. Need to get ewr then EDI Scotland today...sigh
77602,82689,@united has actually addressed the snow tomorrow. but nothing about changing or schedules or canceling flights. Just wait and see.
77608,82697,You gotta fly @VirginAmerica The preflight entertainment is fucking ridiculous #safetymusicvideos #shitswild #getmeadrink
77610,82699,@DeltaAssist I am driving to Arizona from LAS for the big game so I need to get there. What would the cost be of switching to the 12:20P?
77611,82701,just got off the phone with @JetBlue after waiting 55 minutes #neveragain
77615,82705,@JetBlue lousy boarding policy to make a couple with a stroller/infant wait to board until the 3rd group. #illjuststandhere
77619,82709,So I don't get why @AlaskaAir will fly everyone to Seattle from Portland but not Medford just cause of a little fog. Tired of being delayed.
77620,82710,Note to @AlaskaAir the plane #as634 not to delay is a flight to Phoenix today. :( come on get us on our way! #SB49 #GoHawks
77624,82714,@united How does a pilot order too much fuel and make my girlfriend unable to board? Will never fly with you and will be sure to tell others
77626,82716,@SouthwestAir the call center is back up and I was able to reserve my travel.  Before I was getting lost in your IVR system
77629,82719,My husb's been trying to get home since 1PM Fri. Stuck overnight at @AlaskaAir terminal. Then when landing. diverted. http://t.co/oONeBLifnE
77630,82720,Crazy! Commercial @JetBlue flight avoids serious near miss on approach with private plane. Little news coverage! http://t.co/XC6YqAZ3yF
77634,82728,Bungled an @AmericanAir award booking on the last check-out page. now the award space is gone temporarily. #sigh
77637,82732,Awesome customer experience from @JetBlue ! Very prompt response and problem resolution. Thx Blue Team!

77648,82743,I will never fly @JetBlue again !!!!
77649,82744,The @JetBlue pilot became sick ahead of our flight yesterday so we were delayed for hours. The airline took care of us without asking: A+
77663,82760,@JetBlue when will you announce if we can cancel Tuesday flights from Boston w/o penalty?
77668,82765,Get the first class upgrade. then my flight gets cancelled. The plight continues... @united #GetMeHome http://t.co/kXlA2FIVkF
77670,82769,@AlaskaAir Ripoff! Given a dsc code for losing bags last trip.Tried to use it &amp;saw flights exp! But if bought w/o code they are cheaper!

77701,82800,Flight switched. I'm out tomorrow morning at 6! Thank you @JetBlue for letting me switch my flight free of charge!
77702,82801,@JetBlue I see that people who have positive tweets get responses so quickly. Not my fault my luggage was lost in July and never found.
77707,82806,@DeltaAssist WHY DID I PAY SO MUCH to fly our kids last minute to their Grandfather's funeral? You'll always be a bad part of that memory.
77710,82809,@VirginAmerica I am on SQ16 from Seoul. connecting to Vx744. Stuck on Tarmac at sfo. Pls note I will be on flight!
77714,82813,Had to cancel @JetBlue flight for next week - they charged $100 and issued travel credit not refund.  Travel booking - trap for the unwary
77716,82815,@AlaskaAir 100th birthday party! ___ Will miss part of Super Bowl tmrw but I think this is a pretty good reason. Go Hawks! 
77720,82819,@DeltaAssist Please celebrate her! #5599 GRR to DTW on 1/31/15. I slept during service. she came when I awoke to see if I wanted anything.
77725,82824,@DeltaAssist Flying from Seattle to New York no individual TVs. If I was flying from Seattle to salt lake. would be here. #frustrated
77732,82831,@AlaskaAir Thx 4 reply. Was shameful we all spent 30 minutes in the dark not knowing if our loved ones were safe. ticket agents had no info.
77735,82834,@United gate agent at EWR 110 this a.m. is my hero for switching me to an aisle from a middle as I was about to board 6hr flight #thankyou
77738,82837,Flying @AmericanAir is a total disaster. Missed flights on both ends of our trip. Will never fly aa again.
77743,82842,Does @SouthwestAir dot com not work in Mex?! Can't check in. Grrr
77745,82845,I'm sorry @DeltaAssist for cheating on you. this American flight is the pitts
77754,82855,@united are you gonna issue a travel waiver for ewr for Monday like other airlines have already ?
77761,82863,@SouthwestAir I tried to DM but it says you don't follow me so it won't work. Wish the system would say the average wait time.
77763,82866,@Southwestair how do I cancel in-flight wifi after purchase - can__t stream ESPN. so need to cancel it.
77765,82868,@AlaskaAir Another flight delayed. looking a lot like American. Alaska. #SuperBowl

77774,82877,@DeltaAssist trying 2 get 2 PHX but 1:15 through SLC is delayed... Any chance there're enough SEA pax connecting that they'll hold SLC-PHX?
77779,82882,@united what is your policy for overbooked flights? Bought tickets 4 months ago but have to wait for plane to board to see if there's space

77785,82888,Parents stuck in Chicago overnight. Thank you @JetBlue for taking me home from New York to Charlotte direct! #flying #JetBlue
77792,82895,People: always fly Jet Blue instead of @united. United Airlines won't switch your ticket ahead of the storm if there is a snow cancellation.
77794,82900,"Without fail. @SouthwestAir emails that say ""Your trip is just around the corner!"" put me in a panic that I booked flight on the wrong date"
77795,82901,25 years ago I took my first @SouthwestAir flight from Houston to Dallas. Doing it again today. Missing that rear lounge and the $19 fare.

77899,83010,I love flying @JetBlue. but with biz class half-empty and my girlfriend and I seated apart from each other. it's a bit sad y'all couldn't...
77903,83014,So what's next @DeltaAssist ?. I can't switch seats in a half full flight without paying for it. will you be charging for bathrooms next?
77908,83019,@AmericanAir I have been on hold for almost two hours trying to switch my miles ticket having lost my wallet. http://t.co/7HsP7A0xGX
77919,83031,If the hold music going away means I've been disconnected from @SouthwestAir after 40 minutes on hold. I'm going to go a little nuts.

78069,83190,@JetBlue What are your 'longer than normal' hold times. Trying to change flight &amp; been on hold 45+
78074,83196,@VirginAmerica love the airline but the new forced advertising before takeoff is intolerable. Hate this
78079,83201,O Yea! and NO change fees.  AND most likely cheaper than refundable southwest fares. Can't wait to charge my phone at my seat @SouthwestAir
78085,83208,@AmericanAir how long do you guys try to wait before cancelling a flight? From Chicago to dallas. 9:54am
78087,83210,@AmericanAir any way I can modify a reservation online to change my flight tomorrow to fly today? Wait time for phone seems to be &gt; 2 hours
78090,83213,"@JetBlue Flight cancelled yesterday in Orlando for ""mechanical"" reasons. Don't know what the heck happened with the final one we were put on"
78096,83219,@DeltaAssist Why did you cut my miles earned by 1/4!?! New mile earning policy screws Platinum Medallion members!!!!!!!!

78108,83233,I understand you are working on a lot of calls.it is now 37 mins and counting as I wait to change my flight with @JetBlue
78111,83236,@united one would hope that after a cancellation due to mechanical failure between 2 hubs. you guys would have better options getting there
78117,83242,I knew this day had to come... I lost my @united 1K status.  BUT. I went down swinging by flying 20.388 miles in Jan before losing it.

78611,83777,Jetblue flight 761 and it smells like feet!!! throughout the whole aircraft @JetBlue please give me a free drink
78617,83784,A little disconcerted that @SouthwestAir doesn't send out emails when flights are cancelled. Seems better to over-email in cases like that.
78618,83785,@DeltaAssist I'm flying from Pittsburgh to Seoul tomorrow through Detroit. Is it likely that the snow storm would delay the flight?
78619,83786,I hope I'm not missing too many good #Superbowl2015 commercials. Good thing @JetBlue has tv
78623,83790,Nope @united was told there are no flights tomorrow DTW to NYC #snowedin

78700,83871,@DeltaAssist are flights cancelled tomorrow morning arriving in Providence. RI?  DL2225 ATL to PVD?  When will they make a decision?
78704,83875,@AmericanAir You need to up your game on AA 371. Unforgettably bad 1st Class experience! Would have been better off flying coach. #fail
78706,83877,Despite a delay due to weather it was still another wonderful experience with @JetBlue thanks for your great customer service! #freemarket
78710,83881,@AlaskaAir I love you but am really sad. had my emotional support animal and got a lot of slack from your team. Really disappointing
78713,83884,@DeltaAssist flew LGA to STL Fri. Your ground crew destroyed a toy donation. You owe STL Children's Hospital some toys!
78717,83888,Alaska Airlines has 75 open seats on earlier flight. but wants $25 for a same-day flight change. #CustomerService #Idiocy #Fail @AlaskaAir
78729,83902,@AmericanAir Hello. I'm supposed to arrive at LGA tomorrow from ORD at 6pm (AA364). are expecting the cancel these flights?

78882,84067,@AmericanAir How long should we expect to wait for a refund for lost baggage allowance expenses?
78883,84068,@united is probably the worse airline. Why would you cancel a flight in the middle of the day but allow all other flights to go out? 
78895,84081,Really @SouthwestAir? I understand all flights today are now cancelled. but now we can't fly until Wednesday? This is a joke.

78911,84098,@AmericanAir: Not cool: changing my flight to 2 hours earlier w/o notifying me. Cool: Mike in reservations fixing the problem for me.
78912,84099,@united did you learn nothing from the angry flyers in Chicago yesterday? #angryflyer #BOSnow
78915,84102,@united No-I ended up just buying a one way from Delta. Held over 3 hrs-should I have held longer?
78927,84114,just saw i got a $50 credit for my cancelled flight on Saturday!!  since it only cost me $32. that's a win-win!!  thanks @JetBlue
78935,84122,@AmericanAir few things upset me more than people yelling at airline staff for something out of their control.
78936,84123,Was mad @SouthwestAir told everyone on the flight their bins were full when a lot were empty. but they explained it. http://t.co/Y8FZ7t8gJG
78946,84135,I'm sure that I'm speaking too soon. but my @united flight to Houston is still planning to leave Boston.  Fingers crossed for #ASC2015
78951,84142,Loving our chipper flight attendant Jamie on @AlaskaAir 162 to ANC this morning. She's fun even tho the Hawks lost! Kudos Jamie! #IFlyAlaska

79012,84209,@SouthwestAir Why on earth would you wait until less than one hour before departure to cancel a flight to Chicago today?
79043,84242,I've never flown @VirginAmerica before but I'm definitely signing up.  Can't miss out on these bonus miles.
79045,84244,@DeltaAssist entering minute 30 on hold. Your website appears unable to process credit card or paypal for me. Any idea why?
79054,84253,@DeltaAssist I've got a lost suitcase; who can I contact? It's been a day since flight landed in Mazatlan. MX
79059,84258,@DeltaAssist is there issue with online/mobile check-in? Keep getting error
79060,84259,@DeltaAssist  looks like I may have problems getting into LGA this afternoon.  Any chance I could switch to either 1942 or 2042 into EWR?

79065,84264,@JetBlue Thankyou JetBlue. I am astounded at your ability to single handedly destroy my holiday.
79067,84266,On hold with @SouthwestAir to cancel a ticket__I am at the 60 minute mark. Is it worth it to stay on hold or to just lose the ticket?

79163,84372,Come on now @AmericanAir you have got to do better. This sitting on the runway forever waiting for a gate has gotten real tired _

79551,84793,@AmericanAir I shouldn't have to wait. Doing so nearly made me miss my 5:30am flight. Bad policy. Should be able to pick a seat at PURCHASE

79930,85202,.@SouthwestAir never answered my #InsteadofSouthwest tweets. Hopefully they don't cancel my flight (again) just to spite me.
79932,85204,@AmericanAir question. If I had to cancel a fully refundable flight. who gets the money back? The person who paid or the person flying?
79945,85219,@VirginAmerica WHY AM I STUCK ON THIS PLANE AT JFK WAITIN FOR A GATE

79989,85265,I would never travel with @DeltaAssist . LOL
79990,85266,@united now has boarding lanes at their gate at MSP.  Lines of people blocking the concourse.  Another bad idea from #WorldsWorstAirline

80006,85283,@JetBlue hi - I'm on flight 0615 to SFO. delayed to 11.30 takeoff. Can I arrive later to catch that or do I still need to be as if normal?
80014,85293,This is a PSA that @SouthwestAir is my official airline and Not Cold is always my official destination. Let's avoid unnecessary problems.

80902,86243,More details on the slow. painful demise of @jetblue http://t.co/kIaFoJwQDE
80905,86246,@DeltaAssist - how changing SOP to not taking the coats serving drinks to first class to 1st class passengers when the flight is delayed?
80910,86251,I am happy that @VirginAmerica rectified the issues I had with my flight. THANKS!
80924,86267,Still mad that @SouthwestAir made my last flight a nightmare to book
80928,86271,Disadvantage of switching to earlier @SouthwestAir flight. Went a16 to b7. So much for exit row. Get home earlier though! #companionpass
80944,86288,Burning smell?  Power outage? Yup. There's our @AmericanAir plane NOT leaving Nashville. :_ http://t.co/mIEMCe7Wu4 http://t.co/bg9CihcUaY
80949,86293,@AmericanAir flight # 225. Bullshit you're about as sorry as George costanza when he killed susan
80962,86307,@DeltaAssist poor customer service yet again. Not sure why I keep my status with you....
80964,86309,Tweeting at 35.000 ft will never not be novel to me. @JetBlue from Fort Lauderdale to Pittsburgh!
80966,86311,@VirginAmerica Very upset at these flight delays.
80977,86323,@SouthwestAir Oh. how I miss working there sometimes.
80980,86326,@deltaassist I'm trying to use my companion cert. Very very inflexible perk!  To be told call Amex on this from the medallion desk is bad!

81007,86355,I have 13 @SouthwestAir drink coupons. I will never use them all. What's a non creepy way of buying a round for 12 of my fellow passengers?
81014,86363,@VirginAmerica After just applying for a Virgin Credit Card and getting approved. I now have to wait 10 days to book my flight.  #Failure
81015,86364,@deltaassist Need help on my trip tomorrow. I don't think my KTN is entered and would hate not getting precheck.
81017,86366,@JetBlue Your website tells me to call so I can cancel. I hung on for 14 minutes only to be cut off. I'm Mosaic and want to do this online
81021,86371,@DeltaAssist I double booked a trip can I cancel one?
81023,86373,Yolanda @SouthwestAir is my spirit animal! After my flight to Vegas was delayed she moved me to earlier &amp; more convenient one! #BirthdayTrip
81027,86377,Quick S/O to @AlaskaAir. The circumstances for why I had to cancel my flight are hard. but their fantastic service made everything easier.
81028,86378,@VirginAmerica Another awesome flight from PVT!!!  Can't wait to get onboard again!
81037,86388,@united sorry to see you discontinuing so many flights between PBI &amp; IAH.  The drive to FLL is grueling.  #nothappy
81038,86389,@DeltaAssist 11th on an upgrade list as a platinum medallion. did I waste my time completing the status challenge in October?
81039,86390,@DeltaAssist i had to leave the airport... Had an appointment... Is there any other way I can contact you guys about this?
81040,86391,Miserable evening with @JetBlue. 2 hr delay from PIT to BOS followed by an obscene wait to receive my bag #NotCool
81052,86467,@JetBlue thx for leaving 10 mins before the scheduled departure time. Now I get to waste time and be on stand by hoping to get on the next
81057,86473,@DeltaAssist Not loving the new mileage program. Platinum is now basically worthless! #delta #skymiles #nothappy
81058,86474,@DeltaAssist E-Mail sent. FlyDelta #windowsphone app need an update bad. Still on 1.15. Andriod and IOS is on 3.10.Thanks for the repsonse.
81060,86476,@united what an awful new standard to earn status. Got downgraded to Silver even with 16-20 paid segments /yr and close to 30k miles
81061,86477,@DeltaAssist if I book an award ticket. am I able to cancel within 24 hours with no penalty or loss of miles?
81068,86484,Someone was supposed to warm up my @AmericanAir flight at 4am. They didn't. And so we wait for it to thaw. Grrrr.
81076,86492,Why bother picking seats when you just move me? @AlaskaAir Traveling with 3 and now we are sitting apart. #RuiningMyBirthday
81078,86494,Did you hear about the @JetBlue near miss in NY? You shouldn't have. since it was a non-event. http://t.co/DPjW56Sq3E

81173,86593,I miss flying  @VirginAmerica . they would of charged me nothing to change my flight and gave me free drinks
81182,86604,@AmericanAir you apologize. but nothing changes. Paper vouchers = wildly inconvenient - call airline then mail voucher or go to airport?!!!
81183,86605,This is my third delay today @SouthwestAir
81185,86607,Come on @AmericanAir. ur NOT supposed to touch or stand on the #coral. #Human skin oils kill this delicate #ocean organism thats dying fast.

81204,86627,@united Are you joking? I've been trapped on the plane because you closed the door 10 mins early! Fix your ops!
81205,86628,@JetBlue I have contacted your airline (many times). Awaiting their response.
81211,86634,Todavia!!! We have not taken off! #fml move it! @VirginAmerica #lateflight sucks!

81252,86679,Hey @JetBlue bummer to see delay from SLC to LGB. Curious. any idea what's causing delay? #airportblues
81258,86685,@AlaskaAir VERY upset you guys moved my seat. I booked window seat months ago. Why was I forced into an aisle? Conf #LTRRPU

81330,86767,@JetBlue why is my flight 112 delayed for 2 hrs? Its sunny in chicago and bos.
81332,86769,@AlaskaAir why is sea-geg so often delayed as is geg-sea? Cross state antipathy?
81341,86778,Next time @JetBlue can you please change the weather pattern so that the snows misses us and my flight isn't delayed? Thanks.
81359,86797,@AmericanAir I hate you
81363,86802,@AmericanAir 3622 We are having to wait for a bus. no cars available to rent. Ridiculous.
81368,86808,@VirginAmerica thanks for the free drink! Definitely makes up for the delay!!!
81370,86810,All of @AmericanAir tweets are apologies for crappy business.
81372,86812,Very bad day with @AmericanAir  1.5 hr wait for bags after flight 1226 jfk while other airlines were 15.
81381,86822,@united why have express but then have to wait in line again to drop off bag! #incompetent #employeesnohelp #bsunhapy http://t.co/U4kRtKRVIY
81399,86841,@AmericanAir I passed by our national airport in Trinidad and Tobago today and saw one of the new planes can't wait to fly in one
81402,86844,I'm always pleased with @JetBlue even when there's a delay. the employees do their best to accommodate everyone. Kudos 
81413,86855,@DeltaAssist are we allowed to bring a cup of yougurt from home to eat while we wait to board or  do we have to buy it after security
81419,86863,So what's up with the @united luggage tags no longer having your name or MM status printed on them. but just a generic tag?  Sad
81422,86866,Thank you @JetBlue for getting us on earlier flight when our flight was cancelled!!! You are awesome!! Thank you 
81428,86873,Why is this airline  @AmericanAir always delayed?
81435,86880,@SouthwestAir  When will you be opening up flights for September? You're missing out on a lot of business that month with it being closed.

81458,86903,@JetBlue ... I've been waiting for you!!!
81469,86915,Only on a @SouthwestAir flight does it take longer to board the plane than to actually reach our destination. #herdingcattle
81476,86922,Just flew in from Miami Beach BOAC. No. wait. it was @VirginAmerica.
81478,86924,Another @united delay. Reason?  Crew. Again. Is happening way too often - and it is the beginning of the month... le sigh

81849,87315,@AmericanAir missed connection due to plane issue. Mechanic came onboard. Changed planes and had no prob. Watched other flights leave...

81862,87328,@DeltaAssist why am I not working towards platinum when my 2015 status is gold? Have to start from scratch every year?
81872,87338,if you're going to switch airports on us from sfo to San Jose it would have been great IF YOU LET US KNOW VIA EMAIL OR TEXT @AlaskaAir
81879,87345,@AmericanAir has the site been fixed? I couldn't buy cards earlier this week. Sort of annoying to try and find out it doesn't work.
81885,87351,really upset I lost my 100$ coupon I got in December from @SouthwestAir ___ I could have used that
81886,87352,@AlaskaAir Can't wait to fly first class with you to Maui in June..We flew with you last year also.  You are the best.
81889,87355,Too true -  After a long day of engine trouble &amp; missed flights. they're miracle workers at seeing u (&amp; bags) 2 your destination @AlaskaAir
81890,87356,@VirginAmerica Been on hold 39min trying to change flight. Can't do it online even though you say I can. 1st flight with you. Not impressed.
81896,87362,You would think with how little I travel that I would manage to find a .@united plane that wasn't broken. I'm on a 3 in a row streak!
81901,87367,My run of delayed flights continues despite new airline. and connection points.  Advice: don't fly with me. Today: Mech on @AmericanAir
81902,87368,@VirginAmerica - what time is the delayed SFO to AUS scheduled to land in Austin this afternoon?
81906,87373,@VirginAmerica can I cancel 1 passenger on my trip
81910,87377,@united is there any specific reason for UA1165 delay or is this your regular business conduct ?
81913,87380,Hey @AlaskaAir. being on hold for 35 min has been bad enough without being subject to constant advertising. Maybe stick to elevator music?

81928,87396,I hate that I'm flying into SFO on @united. I should have flown a different airline into SJC. Miles aren't worth delays.
81935,87403,On hold for 50 mins with @JetBlue. even put on hold once w/o any warning - just. ZAP. What happened to this airline? Used to be the best.
81943,87411,@DeltaAssist it is really quite inconvenient to call every time I am thinking of planning a trip.  Why cant you just be transparent?
81944,87412,"WTF? @DeltaAssist: Delta no longer publishes Award charts. We've launched the new Award calendar which offers an easier search for Awards."""
81946,87414,@VirginAmerica  I'm surprised you only have one plane going between EWR and SFO_ this delay completely flipped my SF trip upside down_
81952,87420,Boarding Group 4. Sucks to drop to no status after years of 1k. Platinum and Gold. They don't care about the 600k+ I've flown on @United
81955,87423,@JetBlue Not gonna lie. I'm crushing on JetBlue ... Quickly becoming my favorite airline
81958,87429,@united  here in Newark at gate 105. Agent can't even be bothered to look at me and say I'll be with you in a minute http://t.co/11xLpSHBbI
81960,87431,Still have not heard back from @VirginAmerica waiting on guest services forever!
81963,87434,@SouthwestAir You are killing me today! Boarded the plan 15-20 minutes early??  Boarded with C 31- 60 but paid for Business Select! Flt 2602
81964,87435,An airline that opportunistically cancels flights as soon as weather provides an excuse while competitors continue to fly: @VirginAmerica
81982,87455,@SouthwestAir it looks like flight #382 is delayed more than 2 hours. can you rebook us to the earlier flight from BOS to BWI?
81983,87457,Am I one of those people who take to Twitter when things go wrong? I am today: @virginamerica you failed so hard
81989,87463,So basically. @united: if you want an aisle seat. you have to pray your carryon gets on board. And no tvs. What is this. Southwest?
81998,87472,@JetBlue Jamaica Only Because I've Never Been
82013,87487,@united 17th on the upgrade list for a premier platinum?! #worthless #noloyalty
82015,87489,@VirginAmerica heyy.. Still awaiting reply on the cancellation of ticket.. Confirmation numbr : BKLNRV
82019,87493,@united You would have had you not taken our pilots off this fully loaded plane to fly a different plane so we can wait for ANOTHER crew.
82021,87495,@VirginAmerica I've been stuck at SFO since 11am due to VX90 delays. Is our crew OK to take off at 1830 or should I expect cancellation?
82027,87501,@JetBlue 2 hr equip delay free movies that don't work at any seat. And this just opened bag of #Doritos thanks http://t.co/BAIoP7vFXI
82033,87508,@united Yes!  Need to be in San Diego by 9pm. People are very upset at the gate for Flight 5207.
82041,87516,@united Hi there - can you DM regarding an issue with an award fight booked on Air China?
82051,87526,Super annoyed @JetBlue flight didn't have movies! I purposely left my laptop in my check in. I'm not mad. I'm disappointed #timeout 
82066,87542,@VirginAmerica seemed obvious all day sfo flights were delayed but you waited til it was too late to change the flight to tomorrow
82069,87545,@AmericanAir landed at ORD and have to wait for gate to open.  Could make next flight tough to make.
82081,87559,@SouthwestAir an angry man almost delaying 855 DCA to Atlanta. Flight attendants and security dealt with him professionally -thank you!
82090,87568,.@united on UA1263 and were waiting at KON to de-fuel so we can go to HNL to re-crew. Any word on when we might make it back to SFO?
82099,87577,Curious why my @virginamerica flights from BOS to SFO are so often delayed when other flights seem to be able to make it in. #getittogether
82102,87580,@VirginAmerica Great job by the terminal guys for our 4 hour weather delay. Appreciate the good service.
82106,87585,@VirginAmerica Thanks for not keeping anyone in your terminal updated on travel to sfo. Just found out about another 2hr delay from google!
82108,87587,@DeltaAssist what's going on with 1438? Supposed to leave in 15 and there's no gate agent here.
82109,87588,@JetBlue I'm waiting at the gate for my long over due vacation a whole week in Puerto Rico can't wait!!!
82115,87596,I am no longer a @VirginAmerica virgin. Fantastic first flight! This will not be my last. Thanks to a top flight crew on flight 737.
82120,87601,I'm trying to give @United my $$$ but after going thru all of the reservation and credit card screens I keep getting an Error page. Grrrrr!
82134,87615,@AlaskaAir it just sucks knowing this means we are probably driving home from the airport tonight...
82136,87617,Omg @JetBlue I'm on the mint flight and my outlet half works and my TV DOESNT EVEN WORK. This is the 4th time in the row! I'm disappointed.
82139,87620,Shout out to @united always taking care of shit! http://t.co/1hef13jAcu
82146,87627,@AlaskaAir looks like our delay on Flight 341 to SEA will have us miss our flight 698 connection to SPO. Any compensation?
82147,87628,Ok last thing. I hate flying (as u all probably know by now...lol) but we had a pretty great experience flying @JetBlue today!
82150,87631,@JetBlue I'm a broke college kid so $150 is a huge deal.
82156,87637,@JetBlue Any info on why 2034 SFO--&gt;BOS is delayed? Thanks.
82157,87638,Woo hoo! Just booked my flight to #LosAngeles with good ol' @JetBlue! Can't wait to visit the West Coast again!
82161,87642,@united for a horribly useless milage program.  Hundreds of thousands of miles but never work on any date or place we need to go. #epicfail

82196,87680,@United Why doesnt my first class seat recline? You would think that this would be taken care of prior to boarding. #unhappycustomer
82198,87682,@united airlines. asks us to line up and prepare to board.... Wait 20 minutes and announce there's no pilot so never mind.
82205,87689,@united ua1278 Haven't we suffered enough tonight? Let us go!
82207,87691,@SouthwestAir Am I missing something or is it not possible to book multi city flights on the website?
82211,87695,@united are THE most unreliable. irritating airline there is going and i will be sure to never fly with them again #beyondannoyed

82259,87746,@SouthwestAir We are leaving Milwaukee tomorrow to go home to Boston. Any word if flights will be delayed or cancelled due to snow?
82261,87748,@JetBlue . it's NOT okay to rebook my Vegas birthday trip for a flight 24hrs after and I get alerted 3hrs before before I leave for airport!
82269,87758,@united 2 weather 1 mechanical
82270,87759,Very disappointed to hear that Delta has deleted its award travel charts. No longer will folks know how many miles to save up. @DeltaAssist
82282,87772,Woke earlier than needed to check in for @united flight. Told there's a problem &amp; to check in in person. That makes more sleep possible!
82293,87783,"@AmericanAir I was on Flight 3317 on the 4th and 1357 on the 6th - both flights delayed not because of ""act of god"""
82298,87788,Wait so if you upgrade to first class on @AlaskaAir you can't go in the lounge? Cause that's what they just told my husband. Dumb rule.
82299,87789,@DeltaAssist Haha. I'm more than aware of how to find flights with miles. The problem is I can't plan what awards will cost in the future.
82308,87799,10 yrs ago this week I started flying @SouthwestAir exclusively for domestic trips. So far: 0 lost bags. 2 delayed flights. I #luv SW!

82415,87911,@DeltaAssist 1/2 I've mostly defended DL's SkyMiles changes in the past. but this crap with pulling award charts is simply abominable.

82579,88079,@VirginAmerica hi. my luggage is stuck at san diegio airport. anyways to get it tonight or have to wait till tomorrow?
82580,88080,Flying on @SouthwestAir is a crap shoot. Sometimes you get stuck in the middle seat. squished in like sardines.
82585,88086,@DeltaAssist wish I would have been informed I had it. I would have used it. Guess I'll be canceling my card for sure and switching airlines
82595,88098,This view never gets old. Quick trip back home to #Seattle. Snapped this shot earlier aboard my @AlaskaAir flight. http://t.co/IOdET3BZP3

82728,88237,@JetBlue why is today's flight 1098 cancelled?
82734,88243,Rough start @united. No flt crew in CMH and no info on why or when we'll leave. Customer service fail. Lots of missed connections.
82736,88246,So disappointed in my first @JetBlue experience. Today could not have been a bigger disaster and I was so excited to fly with them
82743,88253,@VirginAmerica My flight VX910 has been cancelled. What options do I have to get to Boston today or tomorrow?

82787,88299,#GUATE #FFF: @AmericanAir cancelled today's flights. If you're traveling in the next couple of days CALL IN! Many ppl being rebooked. B-Safe
82795,88307,@VirginAmerica really?!?!  Over a 2 hr wait time on phone reservations?  Rediculous! !
82799,88311,@United I guess the whole 'winter maint' thing ain't workin out too well: UA1255 30min late due to maint. Maybe won't cancel like IAD did.
82800,88312,Convinced @united's website is just always down for a technical issue. You'd think such an expensive airline would have a decent platform.
82802,88315,@JetBlue okay thanks so you think late Tuesday night flights will be affected by the storm as well?
82804,88317,@JetBlue already wasting my time down grading my seat on flight 224. Thanks for making me wait an extra 45 mins for nothing

82893,88411,@VirginAmerica is flight 211 from Chicago to SFO delayed and any idea why? Thnx!
82896,88414,@AlaskaAir This Flight 383 delay is untenable.

82952,88474,@JetBlue flight 1379. from DCA to Ft Lauderdale today was perfect.  Cabin crew was a hoot. lotsa laughs.  Baggage claim was SLOW.

83125,88656,@AmericanAir  when you say you are going to deliver a bag that was lost Today I would expect it today? Why a second delay?
83128,88659,@JetBlue you may have good flights and great service. but your mobile app sucks #21stcentury

83365,88909,@SouthwestAir 3 hours delay in Phoenix.Az for flight #1263 and then landed in a different airport and say sorry
83367,88911,@AmericanAir surprised that any airline still has their in-flight movies on a loop-so you have to wait until a time when it starts. Its 2015
83377,88921,.@VirginAmerica you got us on. off. on &amp; in the sky after a 6+ hr delay that wasn't your fault and made it as painless as possible. #thanks

83404,88948,Flying @AmericanAir today. which means I will be harassed by a gate agent checking to see if my carry-on fits. It will. like always. #SMH
83406,88950,@JetBlue are your flights really going out today? Gov urging people to not go out. How soon would you cancel a 5pm flight?
83409,88954,@JetBlue hows it possible that Flight 252 is still a go to Boston when all other flights have been cancelled? Not complaining. just confused
83413,88959,@JetBlue are you going to cancel flight 951 today out of Boston
83417,88963,@JetBlue When should we expect to hear if flight 951 is cancelled? Can't imagine it won't be and would like to avoid my in laws trudging in.
83421,88967,@AmericanAir I'm on AA2285. I'm seeing some cancellations and don't want to waste a trip out to jfk. What are my options?
83424,88970,I'm fucking retarded. I missed my flight with @SouthwestAir AGAIN; this time. it's all my fault. I misread the itinerary.
83429,88975,I missed my flight can someone call me ASAP ? @DeltaAssist
83430,88976,@SouthwestAir maybe u could not leave bags out in pouring rain ? Need to look professional not like a wet dog WN1156 http://t.co/7ADdIwnTQw
83445,88991,@AlaskaAir Hoping someone could exceed our customer expectations &amp; allow us to rest after a 5 hour delay &amp; paying $700 for tickets.  Oh well
83447,88993,How come @SouthwestAir plane that came in last night always seems 2have mechanical problems first flight out in the AM? Earlier inspections?
83448,88994,@JetBlue hi guys! do you know how likely it will be that my Flight 289 on Thursday the 12th will be delayed or cancelled? thanks much!
83453,89000,@DeltaAssist  very disappointed!  #poorcustomerservice especially for one of your gold medallions.  Conf # HJHIUS

83466,89013,@DeltaAssist pls explain why RSW flights to LGA -- all of them -- are cancelled while other FL dep cities (MCO. MIA) are flying?
83468,89015,@DeltaAssist  my flight delayed so jumped on earlier flight out of ewr to MSP.    I can't check in to earlier connecting flight to FAR
83473,89021,@DeltaAssist if you volunteer your seat in an oversold situation. and they have multiple volunteers. does status play a role? Just lost 1k

84551,90166,So excited to be flying @VirginAmerica for the first time tomorrow to Cali! Heard nothing but amazing things. Can't wait to see for myself 
84554,90169,Thanks to William at the LAX @JetBlue gate. Very patient and understanding. helped make the best of a 2hr delay.
84556,90171,@JetBlue little delay on the flight but no worries. flight 401 crew today was awesome
84557,90172,@VirginAmerica I will. Can't not wait. :-)

84569,90184,@AlaskaAir  whats the store? http://t.co/L148WYpKFL Give the guy an answer! Never had a bad experience with AlaskaAir. make it right please!
84579,90194,"@united have you decided whats happening to the ""Danish"" issue - For those ticketed with immediate departures we would like to know"
84584,90200,@united This is a bullshit move.
84586,90202,@united are you cancelling all flights that were booked earlier with the glitch?
84587,90203,@united What will the lawsuits and DOT fines cost? What about the bad PR?
84588,90204,@united: We will void the bookings for those who purchased tickets..third-party currency conversion error. http://t.co/sDevyEiyGV #unfair
84589,90205,@united So you fucked up and are retracting legal contracts?! See you in court!
84591,90207,Well it sounds like I'll never fly with @AlaskaAir. Don't want to deal with employees who sound this terrible. http://t.co/CpVnB8V1x2

84625,90241,I know I won't be flying with @AlaskaAir since they treat their flyers like shit. Great customer service.
84632,90248,BAD customer service MT @united: We will void bookings for those who purchased tickets as result of third-party currency conversion error
84637,90253,@AlaskaAir You guys have a serious PR problem. http://t.co/YAcNTp1cRb

84685,90305,@DeltaAssist I was rescheduled bc delay. Anyway I can get back on the 950 msp&gt;gfk flight tonight?
84686,90306,It's 2015 and @united continues to overbook flights -- causing major stress and grief for their passengers! Never again!
84695,90315,@JetBlue not happy another jet blue flight and no direct tv. What were the odds?
84697,90317,@AlaskaAir You guys should take responsibility for the guy on reddit. I will NEVER fly Alaskan Airlines again! #AlaskaAirlines #theysuckdick
84709,90330,@united you guys! I planned my whole spring around my ticket I bought today and them you cancel???? Wtf?
84711,90332,@united I spend $100k GBP in a BAD year with you. After this I'm going back to British Airways.
84712,90333,So @united must luv bad PR. They mess up publish wrong fare. then cancel tix on all that bought. This will keep story alive longer #badkarma
84718,90339,On time departure for sunny #Florida - thanks @JetBlue.  Goodbye #BOSnow; I'm not gonna miss you.

84739,90361,@AlaskaAir did you really have mechanical problems or did your pilot show up late on flight 84 to Seattle?
84743,90365,The delayed (then canceled) flight and an extra night in SFO was totally worth it. Thanks @AlaskaAir  for the travel voucher!
84745,90367,@united decided to unilaterally cancel my ticket reservation from LHR to IAH. I have filed DOT complaint http://t.co/iU8NKlTGms #UnitedSucks
84748,90371,Great job! by @JetBlue attendants Jim and Wendy in dealing with a med issue going into SFO this pm. Calm. caring and professional.
84754,90377,This is going to shock many of you. but @united is as poorly run on this continent as it is in North America. A brief synopsis will follow.
84755,90378,@JetBlue my flights delayed because of this... http://t.co/QbNJanAsDu
84759,90382,If anyone knows an attorney that wants to file a class action suit against @united for personal property damage -- I will donate my time

84767,90391,There's only 45 people on my flight to DC and the plane fits around 140. Ultimate comfort and lack of stress from @SouthwestAir. _
84769,90393,@united I've needed new kneecaps from the cramped. decrepit. ageing planes I've flown on w/you in the past 5 years. Still this is promising
84770,90394,@SouthwestAir early bird check in blows!!!  2 out of 4 times I bought this and got stuck in the B group.  Waste of money IMO.
84773,90397,@AmericanAir can't believe you guys depart flights without warning and leave people stranded
84774,90398,Late departures with @SouthwestAir NO Bueno!
84779,90404,@DeltaAssist purchased tickets with miles for 2 under one reservation. Computer will only allow me to cancel both tickets. not just one.
84781,90406,@united the cost of a meal... but not the inconvenience of a missed connecting flight and a REALLY long wait in line.
84793,90418,I'm dealing with a issue on your vacations page. is there a call center where I can call from MEX @AmericanAir ???
84794,90419,@VirginAmerica Score!  Virgin got me on earlier flight.  Leave 10:30 am arrive 2:10 p

85311,90963,"@VirginAmerica flight delayed 45mins bc of an ""incoming VIP"". If they are so special. why don't they have a private jet?..."
85312,90964,@JetBlue my problem is solved. thanks so much for the quick service!
85314,90966,@AmericanAir way to mess with my vacation yet again. Going to miss my flight to Rio!!!! Any chance 973 will be delayed or held???
85323,90975,@deltaassist i'm stuck in traffic and am cutting it close. advice?
85330,90983,Just booked my flight to SEA in April. Stoked @AlaskaAir had cheap flights! Can't wait!!!
85333,90986,"@SouthwestAir Do you think there might be a problem when 75 percent of your tweets include the word ""sorry""?  Bad decision today."
85336,90989,Crappy our flight is delayed .  - Safety comes first though. Thanks @AlaskaAir
85337,90990,@JetBlue mildly upset that you never re-notified me to pick a seat &amp; I now have to pay $99 two ways for extra legroom. How is that a thing?
85353,91007,Kudos to @JetBlue for their courtesy and service with switching flights to dodge that snowstorm! And no fee charge! Score! TY so much!
85363,91017,Coming in hawt NYC. Thx @VirginAmerica for the diva mood lighting. Can we talk about those missing status miles? _ http://t.co/ZElNuBmZvF
85367,91021,My aircraft has been on the ground for 25 hours. and we still can't leave on time? Oh. @united... Your DOT report shines true. #819 #iaheze
85387,91101,I'm literally praying you don't delay my flights this time @AmericanAir
85394,91108,@DeltaAssist Disappointed in the staff behavior at SFO tonight.  Just because the flight is over sold is not a reason to treat people poorly
85396,91110,@AlaskaAir I just completed my flight but my rewards number is not linked to it. Can I correct that? Online it's not working...
85398,91112,"@AlaskaAir No issue. I am just amused at the irony. I paid the charges. even though the ""foreign"" country is only 15 miles from my home."
85409,91123,I was told @AmericanAir offers kosher and vegetarian but not #vegan though that would kill like 3 birds with one stone or meal in this case.
85413,91127,@DeltaAssist please put me off hold !!! It has been 35 minutes ( and you estimated a 4 minute wait time)... It's 2:14 am and I am sleepy
85414,91128,@united When will you reverse this poor decision and reinstate flights you illegally voided? DOT infringements at $27.000 per ticket.
85417,91131,Oh @DeltaAssist why can't the agent print my boarding pass? I'm going to miss my flight because the agent can't figure it out :(
85420,91134,What's the deal @JetBlue?? bump me to the next day. no snow here- and no compensation or apology? missing a whole day and lots of $$
85436,91151,@jetblue how long does it take for a missing points request to process? Submitted one on 1/25. not sure if delay is normal or not. Thanks.
85444,91159,@JetBlue love you guys. but your hold music is so bad I almost want to hang up. #floridaorbust #stupidblizzard
85457,91172,@JetBlue I am flying from RIC-BOS on 2/15 how soon do you think flights will start being cancelled?
85465,91180,@VirginAmerica could you please start flying to Phoenix so we can see some Spring Training. Flying other airlines makes me miss u so!
85466,91181,Awesome news! Been waiting to hear this for a while @JetBlue to Launch Service to Daytona Beach. Fla. http://t.co/EcWpTd32Pi
85478,91194,Thank you @JetBlue finally flights from Daytona to New York!!!  Can't wait for feb 2016!!!   #jetblue #daytona
85481,91197,@AmericanAir this isn't a problem that happened today only. this route is having problems nearly every day due to an old and faulty plane 
85482,91198,@AlaskaAir we're going to miss our connection to Boise in Seattle
85490,91206,"@VirginAmerica your pre-flight safety music video is ""fresh"" and ""hip""! Not at all ""fucking awful""!"
85492,91208,@DeltaAssist already rebooked. Long day in airports. lots of waiting and canceling reservations for tonight is ahead.
85497,91213,Waiting for @SouthwestAir to issue travel advisory for New England this weekend so I can change my flight. Again. I'm never going home :/
85500,91217,@JetBlue bout to bomb yo shit boi
85501,91218,@JetBlue thank you - was incredibly easy to switch to an earlier flight on Sat. Fingers crossed it leaves on time!
85514,91231,@DeltaAssist Yet another delay Delta. So much for getting home early this week. Flight DL4487 to GB.
85527,91244,I wouldn't be mad if my flight to New Orleans handed out Mardi Gras colored Jell-O shots @SouthwestAir #SouthwestForTheWin
85530,91247,Waiting for the other shoe to drop on @SouthwestAir devaluation announcement. It's disgraceful for them to further devalue revenue based.
85544,91261,@united just upset people are losing jobs.
85550,91267,@JetBlue been on hold for over 25 minutes!!:( not happy
85552,91269,@united the temp problem was with the whole terminal. not only the lounge
85553,91270,@AlaskaAir Thank you for discount code for lengthy flight delay. Any reason codes not automatically put into http://t.co/vRo6uE74tc account?
85556,91273,@DeltaAssist Hi. trying to check a group in online and it won't let us pass the 'verify' passport details. Are there any known issues?
85564,91281,Early morning flight means I'll have the @VirginAmerica safety song stuck in my head the rest of the day. #notabadthing #robotrap
85565,91282,@SouthwestAir if I need to cancel &amp; use an airline Tix for a future trip. how close 2 the original departure do I have to decide to do that?
85583,91303,Too late for bagels so will have to settle - cappuccino and cookies @AmericanAir #AdmiralsClub http://t.co/wlVDRvekX8
85587,91307,@united expect a call. #customerserviceFail
85589,91309,@JetBlue I'm still on hold. I need to discuss a reservation issue asap
85599,91319,@DeltaAssist how do I never get eco my comfort. Always blocked then non status folks get moved into them.  While I am always crunched
85601,91321,Rough start to the bachelorette weekend when all the gifts and favors were lost on a direct flight...along with 9 others bags @SouthwestAir
85605,91325,@DeltaAssist wait hold on. no usb outlets in seats?!? Back to freaking the fuck out (I forgot my Lexapro today)
85614,91334,2 weeks in a row @southwestair let's us down flight cancelled need to elsewhere #StrikeTwo #Southwest_ http://t.co/uFc0MpMvcD
85618,91338,@united they contacted me and didn't solve the issue. I haven't heard back since. I want to hear from a manager #enoughisenough
85625,91346,@SouthwestAir how may I locate an old confirmation number to apply unused travel funds?  No longer have access to the email.
85634,91355,@DeltaAssist Mechanical problem caused me to miss a flight on another airline. THE other airline wants a 353.00 change fee. Delta won't pay!
85635,91356,Forced on a delta flight. @SouthwestAir I miss you __ http://t.co/A44c4DVYIk
85644,91365,@JetBlue Thanks for the info! Hoping for smooth travels but you never know.
85655,91377,@JetBlue what's with serving #Doritos on board? The smell made me want to puke the whole flight...
85656,91378,I fucking love candy! Thanks @virginamerica you guys are the best  http://t.co/dnEaeIH7A8
85663,91385,@SouthwestAir Ewww. I got the feet. Too funny. since if I never saw another cutesy feet travel photo. it'd be too soon 
85677,91400,@AmericanAir stuck in horrific NYC traffic. What's the latest I can check in for my 5:10 flight?
85683,91406,Angry @United late leaving PHX to Lake Charles missed connection in Houston by 3 min. &amp; a  $7.00 voucher seemed the best way to say sorry!
85688,91411,Ok @AlaskaAir 2nd time's the charm to get to ANC after mech delay out of SEA. Here we go! #goinghome
85695,91418,Bargain not: computer glitch @united US$70 First Class fares cancelled outright http://t.co/ubWvTTXJvG #travel #airlines #USA #ff #ttot
85696,91419,@JetBlue What are the odds flight 777 from Boston will leave tomorrow at 7:50pm? #tradeshow #travel #nobackup
85698,91421,Why won't @united let someone change flights without the fee when a storm is coming?? #worstairline
85714,91437,#USDOT looking into whether @united must honor those ultra-low fares. Flyers can lodge  complaints here: http://t.co/zIs3A7n5yC
85717,91440,@DeltaAssist Sorry Delta I tried to be loyal but I'm tired of being screwed because you oversell your flights.  #SEA2ATL
85718,91441,@DeltaAssist I need a phone number for lost baggage at Louis Armstrong airport. New Orleans. la
85723,91446,@DeltaAssist hi. there is a chance I may miss my 5pm flight out of jfk to lax. are there any 530 or 6p est flights?
85724,91449,@AlaskaAir 343. They're aware. The plane's APU is broken. These last two days have been a total travel disaster.
85728,91453,Disappointed in @AlaskaAir for their luggage policy for MVP. I just paid $75 for 1 way for a single surfboard. Time to change that policy.
85731,91456,Flight left 10 minutes early and had no last call. missed it while in bathroom what's going on @AmericanAir ??
85732,91457,"Gogo wifi on @AlaskaAir is so slow that I cannot even load web-based email. ""Fast enough to charge your card. but not do much else."""
85735,91461,@JetBlue considering we've been on the phone for 70 minutes with them and they haven't done shit. I'm not feeling too confident
85736,91462,Arrrgh @united We just lost Global Services Status after 3 years. FRUSTRATED!!!
85738,91464,These @jetblue wait times... ugh.
85740,91466,@AlaskaAir you guys suck.  It's hot as balls in this plane
85747,91474,@VirginAmerica Hilarious! Just got my coupon code for my birthday today (2/13) informing me that I had to purchase tickets by 2/12! #fail
85754,91481,@AmericanAir This is my second flight within a week w/ you guys that is departing late. Board everyone then sit on the plane &amp; wait! #Shade
85770,91497,@JetBlue having trouble checking in for a flight from GCM-BOS tomorrow. No luck with the app or the mobile site. Kinda hoping we're stuck.
85778,91505,@united ok. Here is something that will solve all the late flights due to late incoming aircraft.  Schedule them with some time cushion.
85779,91506,I was annoyed with the guy behind me on my @AmericanAir flt with kicking and pulling my chair; then he gave me his mostly empty beer can 
85787,91514,@AlaskaAir hope you find a gate for us soon- waiting on the Tarmac for thirty minutes to de-plane...Boston
85798,91525,Fly to NYC at least once a month.. Can't remember the last time I left on time. Today's flight delayed over an hour. Not impressed @JetBlue
85804,91532,.@AmericanAir change to earlier flight. now it's so delayed I'm watching a later flight board before my plane has even left la guardia
85823,91551,@AmericanAir #worstcustomerservice
85825,91553,Oh my. @united nearly ruined my evening!
85829,91559,.@JetBlue allows you to cancel flight for free w/in 24 hrs of booking but charges $75 if you only want to CHANGE a leg? Go figure.
85841,91572,@AlaskaAir flight 335... Arrived at 1PM to find out it was delayed until 9PM.  Would have been nice to know before dropping off rental car..
85845,91576,@DeltaAssist need a bereavement fare. which has to be booked via phone &amp; you have a 58 min wait time. surely there's a better way to do this
85846,91577,"Overheard at the airport: ""We do not want to leave without you (but we're totally about to)."" @VirginAmerica #sassy"
85848,91579,@deltaassist How long should I wait for the email? I need to book the flight. but I don't want to pay twice?
85850,91581,Now time-traveling on my exceedingly delayed flight from SFO to CLE. @United. you may want to check your clocks. http://t.co/XT5xR6FkB9
85855,91586,The feeling that you're gonna miss your flight @DeltaAssist to #NYC from #Atlanta

85861,91592,@JetBlue how do you uncheck in for a flight? Trying to rebook online and avoid wait times.
85870,91602,9 of my last 10 @united flights have been delayed or cancelled...including tonight. of course #soyouresayingtheresachance
85881,91613,@JetBlue Here's to Nate. The Man at BOS Gate 28. Making up for a late arriving plane. getting everyone on 1189 quickly. kindly. &amp; w/a smile.
85882,91614,@DeltaAssist I've flown delta for nearly 2 decades. Last week alone 1 flew 3 separate flights. I can never get an isle seat.
85887,91619,I cancelled @AmericanAir trip to BOS because of upcoming storms; $200 change fee w/ no travel warning. Blizzard warning now; no refund tho
85891,91623,S/O to @united for never getting me anywhere on time. #4hourdelay
85897,91629,Hey hey. we have a closed door!  Glad to see @united wants to leave at some point tonight too!  #getmehome
85901,91633,@VirginAmerica it's not working right now
85903,91635,@SouthwestAir if your flight is going to be delayed you should at least tell people....
85934,91668,@VirginAmerica Just a heads-up: the Virgin Limited Edition link on this page is broken. seems to be missing a letter. http://t.co/UMSeKiEz3T
85942,91676,Flights a little late @americanair.  Will miss my Iberia flight tomorrow.   Second mechanical delay today... http://t.co/bUNTxxPAXq

85956,91692,@JetBlue got a flight out of BOS at 5pm with non-ref hotel in CA... Should I gamble and skip the drive to BOS? Hear 90% chance of cancel
85966,91703,@SouthwestAir is devaluing Rapid Rewards program again. for the 2nd time in a year?  That's atrocious. SWA is as bad as the legacy airlines.
85974,91711,2 shots of tequila and 2 beers deep and I haven't even left LAX. Thank you @VirginAmerica for fucking up my Friday night plans in San Fran
85981,91719,Wait. so @SouthwestAir rewards are changing? I can't seem to find the email that was supposed to have gone out to rewards members :(
85984,91722,Was supposed to fly out to CA Sunday &amp; @JetBlue auto rebooked my flight for Tues. NYC really doesn't want me to leave. Bitch #Neptune
85986,91724,Hey @JetBlue. Not cool.
85991,91730,Hey @united I used MP pts to fly YUL-MCO via FLL. Segment from FLL-MCO handled by Silver 3M65. What a disappointment! What gives?
85995,91734,@JetBlue booked a trip for my mom-in-law using my credit card &amp; email. and had to cancel. How do I move the credit to my True Blue acct?
85996,91736,@JetBlue What is your current hold time? Been on hold for 30 minutes
85999,91739,@AmericanAir What's the reason for the delay #1410?
86005,91745,@AmericanAir lost both my bags again. and with an early flight tomorrow I think I won't see them again soon. Last time was a fiasco too.
86007,91747,Note to self: never again fly Delta. Always opt for @JetBlue - the difference is roominess is unreal.
86016,91757,@united got me with the bait and switch.  told me my miles were expiring. so I bought a ticket for UA1654 and they won't apply the miles.
86023,91764,@DeltaAssist Would you be able to tell me with whom I can lodge a formal complaint about the management of the security
86029,91770,@united Perhaps a waver to reinstate the tickets you cancelled unilaterally? Lots of angry frequent fliers out there #UnitedFail
86030,91771,@United You're stranding my wife and baby all day on v-day (plane issue). no compensation. You should be embarressed. #flythefriendlyskies
86035,91776,@AmericanAir why do you lie and say you have no overhead space causing peope to check bags when in reality there's more than enough #notcool
86037,91778,@united I was on the wait list.  Wish GPU would clear before you ask me to pay.  Maybe on the way home it will clear....
86040,91781,@JetBlue late start to boarding in Boston today but your crack staff got everyone on and ready to go. You guys are the best! #fleeingthecold
86045,91786,@DeltaAssist and what would they do about the projectors not working? It's shared monitors not individual
86052,91794,@SouthwestAir HELP lost white mustache polar bear on 1714 LUV-LGA 2/13. Sad friend's girl. Found?
86063,91806,I forgot how @SouthwestAir works and didn't check in the day before the flight so I'm stuck in a middle seat AMA

86193,91944,@SouthwestAir has cancelled all flights after 525 pm today due to storm. Travelers advised to contact carrier for latest flight info.
86195,91946,@jetblue why is there no info on your Twitter or #Jetblue website about the 100s of flights you've #cancelled for the #1inch of snow #Nemo

88169,94047,I will never fly @united after making my trip to hawaii soo stressful. I need a vacation from my vacation! 
88171,94049,@AlaskaAir no worries it'll work out! We're at LAS. I did get a glass of wine for waiting so we'll call it even!
88172,94050,@JetBlue Really??  Sad Presidents Day... 45 minute wait to talk to an agent and your awful web site won't allow logins to change my flt.!!
88187,94065,@Deltaassist 3 out of 4 flights delayed. All 4 planes were filthy. Considering how many other airlines there are. I'll never fly delta again

88217,94097,I hate @AmericanAir
88221,94101,Hey @SouthwestAir - do y'all need to hire more pilots? I'm getting real tired of having to wait on the plane for your crew to arrive.
88223,94103,Bad bad bad @JetBlue Dont let your backend errors show in your app! Also.. Please fix error. http://t.co/4ZsYfitfPX
88232,94112,My friends have been on the tarmac unable to deplane for THREE HOURS because of 2 inches of snow at DCA. @DeltaAssist
88234,94114,@JetBlue overall an unpleasant experience. Usually pretty good but according to everyone around me this is the status quote now. _
88237,94118,@SouthwestAir your status on flight leaving dca to cak needs updating! pregnant relative with small child waiting for info.. cancel or go?!?
88239,94120,@SouthwestAir can't figure out if flight tomorrow cancelled every time I call robot gets city wrong transfers me to operator. drops my call

88264,94149,@DeltaAssist I had this flight today but cancelled. Hopefully it will works out on Wednesday.
88266,94151,Oh @united you really dropped the ball.  You rescheduled my reservation on the day of travel. then there is a delay so I missed my flight.
88268,94153,@DeltaAssist it's 948 and they just finished boarding. The extra 20 minutes would have saved both stress and worry.
88272,94158,"@SouthwestAir why does flight 3131 say ""departed"" at 9:11.when they're still waiting to take off?They've been waiting since 9:15 for deicing"
88273,94159,@united Stuck on plane in DC (from Chicago) for over an hour and a half now... http://t.co/0bd6KfqgnY
88282,94168,@AlaskaAir just open the door of Flight 2. We'll walk home. Better than sitting on DCA Tarmac for 2 hours. Thanks

88368,94257,@AmericanAir thanks- I think it's a codeshare problem. Will do.
88369,94258,@JetBlue just kicked me off a flight because the flight attendant said she didn't feel safe with me on the plane

88375,94264,@AlaskaAir I was on flight 2536 from Portland to Vancouver and my luggage took longer than 20 mins!!!  How do I get a promo code?  Thanks!
88379,94268,@united that number put me on hold yesterday for so long I couldn't wait anymore. I need my bag and I have literally sent u emails
88384,94273,@SouthwestAir advised me to fly to BWI to have better chances to get to Nashville. 4 cancelled flights in 24 hours! http://t.co/Fh2xaLpkZO
88386,94275,Flying @JetBlue back from #sww15 and they were super kind and very accommodating for the 4 hour delay Mama Nature caused.  Gracias JetBlue!
88395,94284,@united. link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can't yet tell what any problems are except see snow.
88397,94286,@JetBlue absolutely horrible use of resources on failed flights 411. 1779. and 1980 despite 2 planes sitting on th ground in Long Beach.
88399,94288,@AmericanAir ALL LIES EVERYONE ALL LIES
88400,94289,@AmericanAir  I can't wait!
88401,94290,@DeltaAssist Departure delayed. will miss connections on 2 flights. Can you reroute us
88411,94300,@SouthwestAir can't you make rebooking simpler? No option to do so online. On hold for 30 min since 4:30am. http://t.co/rHBlLgP2Tz
88413,94302,@DeltaAssist this was supposed to be a direct flight. A text or email about delay would have been best. Many frequent fliers in same boat.
88424,94313,@SouthwestAir we need to be on the 8:20 flight 1040 from BNA on 2/18 or will never be flying southwest again. This is insane. #stressedout
88427,94316,@AmericanAir screws me over. Would not let me on my flight last night and now is trying to cancel my flight today. #activedutymilitary
88438,94327,.@DeltaAssist provides scheduled time but no boarding time. I do not want to get stuck at airport. Please advise http://t.co/rRn2DSFEjY

88477,94370,@DeltaAssist my flight was cancelled from Mexico to Memphis. I am now stuck in Altanta. Ga.. Are there any earlier flights back today?
88480,94373,@DeltaAssist  on flight 1919 delayed and will now miss connection to Portland. Any chance connection from Minneapolis to PDX gets held?
88485,94379,I can forgive the tight seat and the captain being 2hrs late. but losing track of who's on the plane and having to reboard? @AmericanAir
88487,94381,@JetBlue No worries. Delay was minor and dealt with nicely. It was captain of flight 2324 by the way.
88492,94386,@AmericanAir I had to cancel a flight on the 14th. It was insured. I'm trying to determine if I can use it for a future flight
88493,94387,@SouthwestAir has the HOU to BNA flight 1159 been cancelled yet?
88495,94389,@AmericanAir - at DTW is it routine to make us wait 45 minutes to check-in then let a dozen late people skip to the front so i wait longer?
88497,94391,@SouthwestAir Is it a temporary site glitch or are you no longer offering flights from GRR to GEG after Feb? Can't find any online :(
88500,94395,We cannot wait for the new flights between #Newcastle and #NewYork! So pleased @united are starting them soon
88502,94397,@SouthwestAir i tried. it wont let me. i have 2 little kids. i cant be stuck in houston tonight
88504,94399,Hey @SouthwestAir   Two days of calling 1800 IFLYSWA and no answer.  Save me from your on hold music.  Is there another number?
88507,94402,@DeltaAssist just waiting on standby now. Have a flight tomorrow - just don't want to have to stay in a hotel again tonight.
88509,94404,Let's see if Arkansas weather let's me go to Seattle today. . @united please don't cancelled my flight again today
88510,94405,@SouthwestAir how long do I have to wait on hold today? 
88530,94429,@DeltaAssist I didn't lose my bags this time. although I did on my last flight with Delta. The larger issue is being stranded for a week :(
88531,94430,"I actually am in utter shock I've been scammed by a legitimate airline. How is it legally possible for @united to just ""cancel"" a ticket?"
88536,94436,@DeltaAssist any problems getting from Mississp
88538,94438,First time flying @JetBlue.  never again

88550,94451,Still not over the fact @SouthwestAir pulled out of Jackson. Check that - still not over the fact JAN let #LUV leave.
88552,94453,@JetBlue Ok great thanks! I had a great flight. FYI. I'm excited to fly again. I just was frustrated I was not able to check in.
88565,94467,Insane cancellation policy/fee - not flying @JetBlue again.
88569,94471,@DeltaAssist remember that time Delta missed my connection. stranded me in Atlanta. and then an earlier flight took off w/o me the next day?
88572,94474,@AlaskaAir  do you know when BofA miles will be credited in account? Seems late this month. Waiting to book travel.
88575,94477,@DeltaAssist gold med. tired of waiting for fly 656;no updates given;been waiting 2&amp;1/2 hrs; 7 traveling for 60th anniversary;pls send plane

88646,94554,@AmericanAir the CSR was so bad I went elsewhere. Like you always say. we have a choice when we fly. I'm done choosing American.
88649,94557,Finally!!! Too bad I won't be traveling for a while so I won't get to use this anytime soon @SouthwestAir http://t.co/We3Deep5Pk
88650,94558,@AmericanAir let's see you try and make up for the classes I missed.
88660,94568,@AmericanAir broke my golf clubs then stuck me in an endless loop of unmanned phone numbers trying to report it. #badcustomersupport
88664,94574,@AmericanAir can I cancel a reservation within 24hours without a penalty?
88680,94591,Two hours later. our second attempt at a @VirginAmerica flight out of DC hasn't left the tarmac. We just can't win.

88686,94597,As @JetBlue continues to revamp its loyalty program. it's switching #credit cards from #Amex to Barclays. Look out for big new bonuses!

88847,94790,My only issue with @SouthwestAir is they should give u 2 drink coupons if you fly more that 4 flights a month because u have no life! ;-)
88853,94796,@JetBlue #fail My wife on the phone asking to switch flight times. In mid switch gets disconnected. Now cancelled! No new time! No call back

88861,94805,While I like the folding/supportive headrests on the _. I miss the old days when you worried about drooling on your seat mate. @united 
88863,94807,@AmericanAir American Eagle crew in Green Bay has made me an American loyalist. I lost my coat. they found it and had it sent to MSP. TY!

88877,94821,@JetBlue Are there issues with the mobile boarding passes? My app keeps crashing when I try accessing. Thanks!
88880,94824,@VirginAmerica has THE WORST and longest 'produced' safety instruction video. Good lord it's terrible. http://t.co/XkLc0Xczlb
88883,94828,Sad when SWA people act like AA. #poorservice @SouthwestAir #firstworldproblems
88888,94833,@DeltaAssist If someone behind you uses seatback entertainment to pick video or music. it's ok. But games = incessant tapping. It's terrible
88890,94835,@SouthwestAir  why are you the only airlines to cancel all flights into BNA? Been stranded in philly for 2 days. Hoping to get out in the AM
88895,94840,@AmericanAir i don't have a problem. use my pic.
88902,94847,@SouthwestAir no self help way to put in tsa pre check number for existing reservation. Very annoying. 800 is not reachable.

88949,94894,Going to be stuck in the Las Vegas airport for three &amp; a half hours KILL ME f you again @SouthwestAir first person to tell me to gamble dies
88953,94898,Paid $150 to get on an earlier @SouthwestAir flight for it only to be delayed as per usual
88956,94901,Creepy. Made @AlaskaAir tweet and all of a sudden hear an ad for them on Pandora that I have never heard before? Hmmm......
88962,94907,@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
88971,94917,@JetBlue it's been a while since I've angry tweeted an airline. Apparently you read my mind before I could bitch. Thank you for the credit.
88982,94928,Seven hours on @jetblue JFK to Seattle with no TV?  TV is the reason I fly #jetblue #fail http://t.co/LxxZjHKUpt

88995,94941,@DeltaAssist I wanna cry I booked these Australia tix so long ago and used my upgrade vouchers and it's looking so dismal now. :( ughhhhh
88999,94945,@JetBlue Clients got ZERO. in 32 years career never thought this was possible.2 suitcases worth thousands of $$ in Italian clothing robbed.

89102,95051,@united you are lightyears ahead of the security control at Newark airport. They wasted 40 precious mins w bad efficiency. #frightening
89111,95063,@united Filled out at the airport as part of a long day made longer.
89116,95068,.@united: Just landed. A day late with almost no sleep. but here. I feel sorry for the woman I consoled who's mother died during the night.
89120,95072,@SouthwestAir I will no longer stand up for you when people call you Southworst.  Just lost $300 because of you today.

89207,95160,@SouthwestAir step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don't suck so much
89208,95161,"Flight was supposed to leave at 10:51 it's now ""delayed"" to 5:00 any other airline would cancel the flight but not @united #DontFlyUnited"

89225,95179,@AlaskaAir Would be nice if I didn't get a lecture on how I should be more careful after I already admitted the error was my fault.
89226,95180,@SouthwestAir why would I want to when the last time I did. you screwed me out of my early boarding that I PAID FOR.
89228,95183,Hi @JetBlue just got notified my flight is delayed later. Any chance you know the inbound flight # for 1579 going DCA to FLL?
89229,95184,3 hour delay with @AlaskaAir today....at the minimum as they don't know when the issue will be fixed. #sendanewplane #seconddelaysameflight

89355,95320,@JetBlue do you sell open tickets? I have a sick relative and may have to travel at a moments notice. Sad but true.
89359,95325,@deltaassist misspelled ticket names. then split us up to different flights. now broken plane &amp; jet way. http://t.co/aW1pllJ0Jy
89370,95337,@JetBlue I would go to Panama and work with the orphanage I visited back in 2011. Something I'll never forget. #FlyingItForward

89436,95406,@AmericanAir who can I email about my issue today?
89439,95409,@DeltaAssist I'm about to print my boarding pass and notice they combined half of my middle name with my first name. Will this be an issue?
89441,95411,@AmericanAir zero respect for service dogs or their owners. Lawyer not an idiot. Why lie http://t.co/eOj7Z9qg3i
89449,95419,Chicago. we have a problem. Move this plane to the gate so I don't get stuck here tonight. Hello @United #ua1451 http://t.co/UbkeyrVAe9

89474,95448,@SouthwestAir flight canceled tonight and was told I won't receive a travel voucher for the inconvenience. Is that really your policy?
89475,95449,Miss @AmericanAir flight connection due to mechanical issue and still have to wait in an hourlong line in Mia

89500,95475,@JetBlue Gnight checked in at POS &amp; supervisor was unaware of policy. That sucked having to guide him to the internet. He was v unfriendly
89502,95477,from here on out anytime I fly @AmericanAir I will assume it will be delayed. Glad this is the last of my points. done with them.
89505,95480,Reason I like @SouthwestAir. Our flight is being held 20 min. due to late connecting passengers. Wish other airlines had done that for me.
89513,95489,@AlaskaAir Checked in this morning and got the aisle seat I requested for tomorrow's flight. Now. it seems you gave it away. Now I'm stuck
89514,95490,So @SouthwestAir *just* updated their app to support Passbook. Too bad it still doesn't support iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. 
89515,95491,Have been trying to get out of #dfw on @AmericanAir 301 since 8pm mechanical probs 2x who pre triped this bird???
89518,95494,Thank you @jetblue for helping me change flights &amp; waiving the change fee for a family emergency. You made a stressful time a bit easier.
89519,95495,I may not be in First Class but @united flight 806 had some First Class service - much needed for a late nights travel #flyunited

89553,95532,@AmericanAir it was at Des Moines due to a mechanical delay. In the end no big deal just tired after flying 11.000 miles in one day :)
89554,95533,I'd go to illinois to visit my grandma. she just turned 104!  we never see her and she would be so happy/shocked! @JetBlue #FlyingItForward
89555,95534,@united : Unhappy with United's service?  Read Ralph Nader's open letter to UAL's CEO.  Leave a comment or RT.  http://t.co/O0745APIau
89561,95540,@SouthwestAir Flt 463 San Jose. CA -&gt; Denver. CO. Delayed 2 hrs but easily best flight + touchdown in all my years flying. Keep it up!
89570,95549,@AmericanAir You didn't say that mgt was going to test its system. Ignoring your problem pushes flyers to Jet Blue.
89572,95551,@united rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn't do the same. #stillwaiting.
89574,95553,@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning. but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting
89579,95558,@united you board a 630a flight and then cancel it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
89580,95559,@DeltaAssist can I switch my outgoing flights I booked last night?
89588,95567,Not sure how my @AmericanAir plane got stuck in snow at SDF from the gate to the runway...but it did :-(
89590,95570,@SouthwestAir Stuck on 4251 with the heat blasting to try and thaw the water lines.... Kinda disappointed for my first flight as a RR member
89596,95577,Hey @united. bad headlight in PIT. then stranded my cousin in SLC? Left my children w/o their sitter &amp; jacked up my travel plans #bangupjob
89599,95580,So. Middle seat on the flyover to the Left Coast.  But @AlaskaAir changed to a window-proving that not all (terminal) gate keepers are bad.
89607,95588,@deltaassist can I file a lost item report on the app or just online?
89612,95593,@JetBlue I would go to Dallas to see my grand baby that I miss so much. I feel like a piece of my heart is there.
89616,95598,I'm insulted @AmericanAir expects $700 to extend my Platinum status when I missed the 50K goal by 274 miles.  I think I'll try Southwest.
89622,95604,@AlaskaAir Are Emirates first class awards no longer bookable with Alaska miles after March 28? I'm seeing zero availability on Alaska
89626,95609,Come on @AmericanAir let's pull it together. #paperwork issue. Second day of travel. Second delay.

89632,95615,@SouthwestAir why the delay on Flight 423 BDL to MCO? Need to get to Florida for the &amp; races in Daytona
89633,95616,@DeltaAssist Any reason why I can no longer get a real Silver Medallion card or luggage tags? I'm about to make status for the first time.
89634,95617,Well behaved passengers but starting to wonder when 2095 will leave the gate@JetBlue
89637,95620,Sigh. Another email from @SouthwestAir reminding that frequent flyer program is the best while announcing they're watering it down more.
89645,95628,I can't wait til we go to Jamaica next week @JetBlue 
89648,95631,Oh @SouthwestAir why did you have to send me changes to #rapidrewards program. :( Your prices go up and benefits go down. #missing the #luv
89651,95635,Nice to have @VirginAmerica to introduce $39 one-way fares between Austin &amp; Dallas! I'm never driving up I-35 again! http://t.co/verfx7iYGE
89656,95641,@SouthwestAir Please bring back RDU to FLL direct route!  I noticed it is missing starting in late August!  The flights are always packed!
89661,95646,@VirginAmerica gave a credit for my late flight yesterday. Great service !!!! That's a Wow moment! Unexpected gesture!
89672,95658,just looking at @americanair feed you can see how bad they are since all they do there is apologize for their fuck ups ! #hint #yousuck
89676,95662,@AmericanAir I'm having a Problem with the toilet it got clogged so I stuck my foot in it a now it's stuck - LGA to CMH 8:29 departure
89680,95666,Sheeesh. I can't remember the last time an @AmericanAir flight through ABI _wasn't_ 30 minutes late or more. #OffToAnotherMemorableStart
89681,95667,@JetBlue My Flight 1318 is delayed and I am connecting from Boston. Is it possible to switch me to Flight 118 so I can make my connection?
89682,95668,@DeltaAssist Are you able to receive a full refund for purchased tickets if you cancel your flight before the departure date?
89685,95672,@SouthwestAir used to exclusively fly SW. but lately. direct flights &amp; cheaper costs have me switched.  why...so... few...direct...flights?
89696,95683,@SouthwestAir unfortunately no. it's my lack of status that's the big problem. My company policy forces me to buy the cheapest tickets
89697,95684,Hey @DeltaAssist u just goofed BIG time. Agent switched my bags for other passengers that have a similar last name &amp; but going elsewhere.
89699,95686,@AmericanAir thsnks for loosing my bad with all of my expensive valuables in it
89707,95694,Remember when @SouthwestAir used to be cheaper. easier. and offer a better rewards program? Further degrading Rapid Rewards is a bad move.
89717,95704,Whatever you do NEVER fly @AmericanAir I been trying use my frights credits for the past month and still no luck.
89725,95713,Very proud of our Social Care team @AlaskaAir. We are honored to have the ability to engage &amp; problem solve for our customers. #iAmAlaska
89731,95719,@AlaskaAir You call this first class??  Even the flight crew was embarrassed.  Flt 561 no food even 4 sale #notcool http://t.co/cp1X1SnYSe
89736,95724,@AmericanAir first we need to wait 35 days to get a refund. NOW we arrive and have no bags! Are you paying for the new items we need to buy?
89753,95741,@VirginAmerica on flight VX399 headed to LA from JFK - dirtiest VA plane I have ever been on. Sad for a great airline.
89761,95750,Every time I fly on @VirginAmerica. I realize I never want to fly on any other airline. I really wish they had more routes out of Chicago!
89774,95803,V sad I'm not flying with @SouthwestAir today :(((
89775,95804,@AmericanAir This has been going on for three days for the same route. It's not a real time fare issue
89783,95812,.@americanair name me one person who uses these outlets...your shitty airlines makes zero sense. http://t.co/jf2F6PkDQr
89790,95819,@united I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won't waive change fee for flights I had to cancel due to east coast storms.
89792,95821,Apparently our @JetBlue pilots decided to go home without flying our plane. Stuck in the icy tundra of #Boston for a bit longer. #blessed
89805,95834,Always late. Must be @united
89807,95836,Checking in for my @united flight and they ask for my phone number. I can only assume that this is for my inevitable flight delay text.
89811,95840,Ridiculous for everyone to miss connections because we have to wait for an open gate after landing. @AmericanAir
89812,95842,@DeltaAssist is flight 105 off the ground yet? Boston to Atlanta. What's the delay.
89813,95843,"@SouthwestAir any idea if there will be any ""spring sales"" soon for travel from late August to early September? Going from PA to LAX."
89820,95850,@DeltaAssist any chance you can tell Delta #2407 at JFK that Delta #3405 is on the Tarmac at JFK hoping to make connections!!!
89821,95851,@DeltaAssist I was affected by #Octavia and was rerouted and delayed my delta miles account states in not eligible for miles why is that?
89824,95854,.@JetBlue Wish you would make Austin. TX a hub. Missing you as my only airline for all my biz travel since I moved from BOS. :(
89836,95866,@AmericanAir this pic was taken from mid air at 35.000 feet. Although I'm still upset at AA for a previous flight. http://t.co/Xo3Tp2g1WF

89867,95900,Devastating disappointment imminent.  Screw it. First class upgrade on @VirginAmerica. I'm going to need all the bloody marys they've got.
89870,95903,@DeltaAssist no assistance needed! Snacks were served to first class &amp; would prefer to not overhear attendants speaking poorly about others
89871,95904,@JetBlue excited for my first flight w/ you today! It's delayed though- can you give me the 411? Flight number 989 from Boston to DC
89877,95910,@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
89887,95921,I swear Everytime I fly we never leave on time @SouthwestAir
89888,95922,That time at the airport when the TSA pre check line is longer than the regular one ... Smh @JetBlue #JFKTerminal5
89890,95925,@united Donna and Juan still the best in the United Club_ too bad UAL does not get it

93248,99464,Off we go again. this time to Chicago. My fist is bigger than the TV screen on this flight.  @united you need to upgrade your shitty planes.
93256,99472,The @SouthwestAir gate agents were so polite I actually bothered to tweet about it.
93262,99478,@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - late &amp; -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket
93263,99479,Hi @AmericanAir me AGAIN. So arrive in BA a day late after missing family event...hoping to put your mess up behind us. NO LUGGAGE????!!!
93264,99480,@united this is the second time my flights been cancelled... Like really?
93266,99482,Why can't people just grab the first seat they see on @SouthwestAir ? If we miss our push time. we can't take off. Come on people. Sit down!
93274,99491,Christ. @AmericanAir if you're going to cancel my flight a day in advance then notify me a day in advance.
93292,99512,Never noticed how stylish the @VirginAmerica male F/A uniform is. Wow.
93293,99513,I'm living in a private hell of cancelations and delays because @AmericanAir tried to save money by mooching of other's de-icing equipment.
93298,99518,@united - Group 2 line gets longer every week. Almost no one left for Groups 3-5 anymore. Time to make Explorer Card Group 3?
93300,99520,@DeltaAssist Do you no longer fly non stop Dublin. Ireland to Atlanta? Cannot find flights on your website.
93304,99524,@JetBlue Thanks JB. Actually. As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them.
93305,99525,@jetblue are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We're just sittin' here on the tarmac  waiting.
93306,99526,Nothing like the smell of morning breath on the passenger next to me to welcome me back to NYC. @VirginAmerica

93370,99595,@AmericanAir why cancel #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too late to find a reasonably priced alternative.

93889,100135,So depressing. Met with a US airline (customer) today that__s in the top 3 and realized how shitty flying on @united is even with status.

93895,100141,@DeltaAssist app broken is lots of ways. Maybe test wallet and tweeting functions.

94031,100283,@AmericanAir Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
94034,100286,@JetBlue Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX on or around the date of March 5?
94035,100287,@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat. safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat
94037,100289,Not only was my @AmericanAir delayed (as always) we're waiting for an open gate like a peasant. Never again on this airline. What a disaster
94041,100293,as if the trip was bad enough @AmericanAir soaked my bag

94093,100350,@DeltaAssist delta is going downhill fast!  I'm still waiting and it's been 35 minutes!
94094,100351,@united Why tell us flight is delayed. then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!

94168,100429,@AmericanAir is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be.
94169,100430,Thank you @VirginAmerica LAX Ops and Twitter support for tracking down my lost headphones!
94171,100432,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.

94241,100503,Last @united flight before the unfriendly changes of March 1. Sad day. #avgeek
94245,100507,@SouthwestAir - We left iPad in a seat pocket.  Filed lost item report. Received it exactly 1 week later.  Is that a record?  #unbelievable
94247,100509,@DeltaAssist Too sick to travel today.  Cancel reservation.  On hold over 1 hour 800#
94250,100513,Only @united would give up your seat during boarding and not feel bad about it or care about what you have to do because of it.

95489,101823,@SouthwestAir Have you guys thought about doing tiered pricing for wifi? Longer flights pay 8 but short flights like SD to vegas are cheaper
95496,101831,@SouthwestAir... I hope you guys compensate the poor people who have been stuck on the Tarmac in Ontario headed to Sacramento then Portland

95528,101866,@DeltaAssist delta 1977 out of ATL. Poor communication. 2 hours to de-ice???? Not the best day for Delta
95530,101868,@AlaskaAir kicking it up a few notches on the First Class svc -SEA to DCA.  Impressive.  Worth the money.
95541,101880,@AlaskaAir - But for how much longer? Delta is encroaching in a big way.
95549,101888,@DeltaAssist trying to contact you - call wait time is over 2 hours?
95565,101904,@AmericanAir I flew AA 1641 into Miami. While disembarking. a woman in the row in front of me grabbed me because she believed I should wait.
95574,101913,Feeling bad for the @SouthwestAir teams at Ontario Int'l. Seems like a lot of uncontrollable issues with flights today.
95577,101916,@JetBlue THANK YOU!! Can't wait to book my trip!!

95615,101957,@SouthwestAir while that may hold true for the east coast. that's a poor excuse for flights on the west coast. #unreliable.
95620,101963,I've flown a lot. but I've never seen such unforgivable incompetence as displayed by @united today. I'll try another airline next time.
95623,101966,Thanks @JetBlue for another delayed flight from Rsw to BOS. You really need to do better. #late again
95644,101989,I'm sorry @JetBlue but you are handling this one extremely poorly. For real.

95700,102050,@united I knew the status. Didn't need help with that. It's just irritating that there were 6 planes trying to board at once
95712,102065,@DeltaAssist Trying to call about my rescheduled flight. Wait time is &gt;2hr. There is no option for a callback. I've wasted so much time.

95913,102284,Today I learned that @AlaskaAir alerts don't get cancelled when you cancel your flight. Feel bad for the ORD bound people. glad I'm not one!
95917,102288,@DeltaAssist she's at the check-in desk at MDW. Everyone is stressed by travel today and your hateful agents are over the top.

96155,102542,@AlaskaAir completely unacceptable that you switch my seat from aisle to middle.  Completely unprofessional
96159,102547,"Would love Robin Hayes to see the ridiculous canned response I just received from @jetblue's ""customer care"" team."
96163,102552,@SouthwestAir I am flying MDW-LAX-PHX tomorrow. if my first flight is delayed enough to miss my connecting flight. what happens?
96167,102556,@AlaskaAir It was eventually dealt with. but that long a mechanical delay. trapped on the plane? Also impacted my planned work agenda. So.
96171,102560,Getting off a connection. Please @AmericanAir wait 5 minutes me to run to flight 241 to SFO

96251,102642,C'mon @AmericanAir can you implement a call back policy so I don't wait on hold for 30 minutes?
96252,102643,@JetBlue #jetblue Self service kiosks are a nightmare. JFK &amp; LAX both non-working. Nearly missed my flight twice. Personnel are great tho.
96259,102650,@JetBlue You should hire me for marketing. better than the bad joke guy. not only could I boost sales. and also can make em' laugh...again

96348,102745,@SouthwestAir My disappointment was the story on how planes were grounded due to missing inspections. Always fly SWA but this rattles me.
96350,102748,@JetBlue hey trying to check in at LAX and no one at ticket counter. What's up? Lots of folks waiting.
96355,102754,Oh @JetBlue I appreciate the wifi but wished my tv worked. I have sound but no picture. #ugh http://t.co/5OG9uwfnBm
96356,102755,@united : I'm still waiting. Are you making me wait deliberately so my credit expires on March 6th? #badcustomerservice

96377,102778,@DeltaAssist hey can you tell me what 1532 DSM ATL is doing tonight? It's on a Mx delay and I have a feeling the crew will soon timeout.
96385,102786,I swear I saw @JetBlue sell multiple ticket packages last year. I need that really bad this year. please.
96386,102787,@DeltaAssist do you really not offer taxi vouchers when a passenger is laid over in MSP due to mechanical error ? Run around in MSP!!
96387,102788,Just saw an @united pilot pinning wings on a boy &amp; his bear at ORD. Maybe all the humanity hasn't been sucked out of air travel after all.
96388,102789,@SouthwestAir nothing about Flt 445 BWI-BOS is your best showing. Poor delay coordination &amp; gate check process. Usually you're the best!
96390,102791,Way to go @united - everyone greens tags bags - except those that throw a tantrum and ignore requests - make others wait #whyfollowrules

100760,107404,@DeltaAssist  Hi!  I was flying from Las Vegas to NY DL1569. Stuck in Denver. How can I rebook the flight? Nastassia Borjas
100766,107410,@AmericanAir waiting 4335!
100771,107415,@DeltaAssist on DL 1304 tomorrow. Why is it cancelled and what to do now
100789,107434,@united #bad#experience CRJ7000 waste of $ for 1st class. 1 bathroom in back of plane.  Save your $ or go 1st class on another airline
100801,107446,LOL WHAT THE FUCK @JetBlue http://t.co/N8BqMn68wz
100824,107471,.@SouthwestAir I can't wait to tell you all about my experience on flight 960. Hint: It was awful and you have a lot of fixing to do.
100827,107474,incredibly bad coordination on Dal-Hou @SouthwestAir . making last flight of the day wait this long is ridiculous
100838,107486,@AmericanAir has done nothing but mess up a vacation!  Delays and cancellations. No more AA for us!
100865,107514,Huh. Come to think of it. I think most of the past 7 flights I've taken on @JetBlue have been late. Well. there's always TV.
100867,107516,@DeltaAssist My status changed and my upgrade was removed?!  I now have no seat and a 4 hour wait time.
100869,107519,@SouthwestAir San Diego is the worst baggage experience for regular fliers. Any other city I fly SWA into is so much faster and better.
100870,107520,@DeltaAssist please help your boy. Current call wait time is 4+ hrs. I am stuck in Detroit and need to get to JFK (or BDL)
100895,107545,in the end @DeltaAssist never did call me back or reply to my tweets. hmmm #deltafail
100901,107551, @JetBlue yall screwed me over
100902,107552,@united is the bad weather in SF or CHI? radar doesn't back up your story...

100952,107605,@united on hold for 45mins.I know you want to solve everyone's issue but how about you start finding places for the stranded people to sleep
100962,107616,@United flight 772 out of LAX is missing a crew member and we can't board. Has anyone checked the crapper?
100973,107627,My wife is stuck in Dallas and they are telling her no flights until Tuesday...what are we supposed to do? @AmericanAir
100976,107630,What's going on at #SFO @united? This place is a zoo!  Need some damage control! http://t.co/FurBgOKCA2
100977,107631,@JetBlue I'm confused how all flights from #PHX are on time except you. I know it's a weather issue. but weather is the same for all planes.
100979,107633,@united - I am officially breaking up w you. I have done ALOT of flying and never experienced smthng so badly coordinated. #647 IAD to SFO
100981,107635,@SouthwestAir How are you allowed to pass out peanuts on planes? Peanut allergies? Not upset. just curious.

100999,107654,@AmericanAir Is there anyway to reach the call center? Need to issue an award ticket which is on hold! Phone systems isn't allowing to do so
101004,107661,@united... At least we got a $7 meal voucher. Too bad everything in Newark Airport is closed at this time.
101013,107670,@DeltaAssist is flight 1356 delayed today?
101015,107672,@SouthwestAir #RallyDay in Dallas. Can't wait.

101025,107683,.@united is now doing that thing where they know the flight is delayed but haven't switched the display because they don't respect us.
101030,107689,make us wait on the tarmac for 2 hours with no pilots and the flight crew tells they have no clue what's going on @united are you serious?
101037,107697,@AmericanAir Poor and mediocre management of the NY snow storm. This airline  is no longer what it was. I am 6YP4778. I will quit using it
101041,107702,@SouthwestAir you are the worst airlines on the face of the earth I woke up at 2:30 AM to end up being number 9 on stand by for 6 AM flight
101049,107710,Dear @JetBlue. my trip home has been a nightmare. And it wasn't all the snow's fault. Pissed. #loyalcustomer #maybenotanymore

101059,107720,@DeltaAssist I am not sure if you can assist on this matter or not but 4hr wait time on the phone is a wee bit long when overseas.
101091,107752,I'm negatively impressed by the huge amount of customer complaints on @united social channels. What's going on? #UnitedAirlines #travel

101543,108236,@SouthwestAir have a flight in May. SFO-PVD with only a 45 minute layover in Chicago. What happens if first flight is delayed and I miss 2nd
101546,108239,I really wish @united would stop using Silver Airways. Always been unreliable. and today's trip back is now going to be a mess.
101548,108241,@AmericanAir I need a statement for my Credit Card explaining the reason for my flight delay. CONF: FNKN9X/US. Been on hold for 45mins
101562,108255,@united we've got a problem. I need a direct phone number so I don't have to deal with y'alls automated nonsense.
101563,108256,So far @AmericanAir has come through with getting my guitar on board. Seriously stressed.  #musicianproblems
101569,108262,@AmericanAir on the plane after two cancellations.....too bad the man next to me is alternating between humming and singing LOUDLY.

101634,108329,So disappointed @AlaskaAir in my first class lack of service today.  Not your normal excellent customer experience.
101638,108333,@AmericanAir Odd Q. Can you find out what aircraft flew AA936 CCS-MIA on 07Feb05? Its my 1 missing entry to a 1000+ flight log! Tx #Avgeek

101865,108577,@JetBlue sad I have to fly other airlines...BDL to LAS ;(
101872,108584,@JetBlue  This was not due to a cancellation. Missed my connection because of jetblue. Missed my whole itinerary.

101880,108592,@AmericanAir hate!!!

101961,108682,2M miles and 25 years. I thought service bottomed out 2 years ago. AA proves worse is possible. @AmericanAir
101969,108690,@DeltaAssist Sorry to say. these are worthless to me on the one route I care about. http://t.co/PpbwnttXFY
101970,108691,@united remember that time your pilot wasted enough time to effectively 'time out' and prevented me from attending my buddies 30th? Me too
101974,108696,So. the security issue I encountered with @JetBlue this week was discovered in 2011. How is this not fixed by now?! http://t.co/LnfxRSGraz
101975,108697,Long delay at #LAS but @JetBlue has handled it like rockstars giving us a credit on our next flight with them and a meal comp.
101980,108702,Oh. @united you do suck as much as others say you do.
101984,108706,texting from the sky. drinking a ufo. thanks @JetBlue ! it's not longer a plain ride ;)

104823,111713,@DeltaAssist 2nd flight in a week that's been cancelled. I understand that the weather is bad. but deltas flights seem to be more affected.

104849,111743,@VirginAmerica canceled all DAL-LGA flights even tho AA. SWA. resumed flights. I'm missing an INT flight to Africa that was nonrefundable!
104850,111744,Despite the delay due to the storm. my experience w/ @JetBlue was awesome today! They kept us well informed and had great service at JFK!
104854,111748,@SouthwestAir I'm heading to BOS via BWI. looks like I might be getting stuck there. Any way to change things up. maybe get to Manchester?
104855,111749,Flt 594 from BWI-MSY cancelled with @SouthwestAir. Disappointed as it was hubby's 50th surprise.  Darn snow. Can't get thru to SWA

104892,111787,.@AmericanAir: I waited for a call back to speak to an agent. only for the call back recording to tell me to call later?
104913,111808,.@United's pre-flight safety video is so ridiculously bad. Fire the agency that put that together for you. Acting is as bad as your flights.
104925,111820,Switched to the flight that has been delayed since 3pm. Supposed to take off at 7. Now 9:05. I'm hopeful. I believe in you @JetBlue!

106063,113026,@americanair failed for 5th time in week. 4 flights canceled last weekend. Today flt delayed. connection missed. Switching airports. Grrr
106065,113028,New one. Landed. Stuck on plane. Jet bridge is frozen and can't let us off. :( #almosthome @VirginAmerica #stillhopeful
106068,113031,@DeltaAssist have lost item at ATL lost and found. Know 4 sure it's there. Can't get a real person to check.
106085,113048,.@SouthwestAir how come you've never dedicated one to the state of Louisiana? Even though that's the first city out of TX you flew into. 
106095,113058,@SouthwestAir So I'm guessing it's always broke.
106099,113063,It doesn't feel real that I leave for Florida tomorrow! _ #woo @AmericanAir
106103,113067,Stuck at LaGuardia waiting for a @SouthwestAir flight that been changed 5-6 times now. Any suggestions on how to entertain myself?
106107,113071,@JetBlue Timed out pilots &amp; flight attendant crews were not a FL weather circumstance. If NY knew about delay why no standby crew available?
106108,113072,GG's @VirginAmerica Your booking website is ABYSMAL but oh my! The airline its self is amazing!
106109,113073,@SouthwestAir don't stress. y'all still the best in tha biz.
106112,113076,@JetBlue - sad to see my #Mosaic status be dropped after a lull in travel in 2014.
106120,113084,@AlaskaAir Made it 12 straight flights in Feb/early March with nothing worse than 12 minutes late.
106134,113099,@AmericanAir security at jfk out of control! Do you think flight 2283 will wait for many passengers still in line? Won't make it!
106153,113120,@united what more can go wrong! UA388 first you split our reservation now a tech issue embarrassing time to fly #delta
106155,113122,@AmericanAir = Spawn blocking!   I do Hope the flights are all running alright now :)  I have been waiting to watch. http://t.co/3eHLxkhyji

106179,113147,@DeltaAssist can you tell me why 6284 is delayed out of St. Louis and if you expect to cancel?
106181,113150,Airline lost my gear/amp. but @JetBlue is doing a great job helping me locate it!
106196,113165,@SouthwestAir Can't Wait!
106198,113167,I've always been a passionate @VirginAmerica Evangelist. but trying to redeem miles on partner airlines is near impossible. #burndesk #fail
106199,113169,That awkward moment when your flight gets delayed because @United can't figure out who's onboard...
106209,113180,This snowballed quickly @JetBlue. Lots of very frustrated passengers all around.
106214,113185,Your @AmericanAir flight 271 is a mess. 2 hr wait-No Captain. 2 hr wait-engine prob. We r customers. No accountability. lunch vouchers. Zero
106215,113186,@JetBlue 2hours finally wheels up!! All I ask is safety first. Unusual for your airlines to have issues.
106216,113187,@united why would you cancel 1 of 3 flights to EWR over weather when there is no weather?! #whenwilligetmybag
106225,113197,@AmericanAir really sucks since they purchased USAir. Today's annoyance comes from the Ohare ground crew.
106229,113202,@VirginAmerica - When are you coming to Denver? I miss you dearly!
106235,113209,Why does @united always fail me? On my moms birthday no less.... Always such a disappointment #notweatherrelated
106241,113215,Never get tired of the @VirginAmerica safety video. finally going home!
106249,113223,Hey @united why did you say it was mandatory to hate check my carry on and then proceed to lose it?
106253,113227,FED UP WITH YOUR NONSENSE @AmericanAir
106255,113229,Not good enough @JetBlue. we are breaking up.
106271,113245,Even though my flights delayed @VirginAmerica has been beyond amazing! #DallasBound
106272,113246,@united a microphone issue causing delay? Are you kidding me? CANT WAIT TO BREAK UP!

106322,113299,@DeltaAssist don't let my connection to Chicago leave! I just landed in Cincinnati
106325,113303,@SouthwestAir Flt 61 so close to take off. Back to gate generator issue.
106337,113315,I hope I'm mistaken. this @AmericanAir flight better not be delayed.
106343,113321,@VirginAmerica trying chat. phone and now Twitter to sort out missing points in my elevate acct. Can you help?
106344,113322,@DeltaAssist CONFIRMATION#  GCCIPK I need to cancel this. Passenger Benjamin Kaufman

106418,113398,@jetblue why are you being so bad today you're never this bad!!!
106423,113403,Always sad to see vacation end. but upgrade &amp; a crew that has us laughing before takeoff makes less painful! Love @JetBlue
106441,113421,@AmericanAir tks 4 cancelling flight 4339 for no apparent reason ur $100 voucher for $600 in purchased tickets is disgraceful.
106443,113423,Come on @VirginAmerica stuck at lax waiting for the maintenance man!!!!
106444,113424,Delayed in Boston. only to be delayed in New York too. I guess punctuality isn't high on @JetBlue's priority list today.
106448,113428,@DeltaAssist - landed over 20 mins at MDT and still waiting on my bags. http://t.co/K87WbtneBH
106456,113436,@SouthwestAir flight 1093 - wait 4 hours to hear we need to wait 3 more?

106473,113454,@AmericanAir I'm on the Tarmac at DFW. 45 min wait to deplane pleassssssse hold my 9:35 flight to LA I need to see my kids. #begging #pls
106477,113458,@JetBlue canceled my flight at the latest most inconvenient moment possible. then gave away my seat. now standby?! #neverflyagain #jetblue
106479,113460,Why would a flight leave early before all passengers were on board from connecting flights @DeltaAssist ? Makes no sense__ DL3787
106484,113465,.@JetBlue you keep screwing us over! Because of a human error and we have missed three flights! Fix this.
106493,113474,@SouthwestAir ok...Hope to see nonstop flights return to FLL soon. Now I have to fly another carrier. Gonna miss flying with you airlines
106517,113499,@DeltaAssist if your pilots are going to give explicit delay estimates on-board. it's probably better to overestimate the delay
106521,113503,@VirginAmerica my flight has been delayed.  2nd time this has happened to me with Virgin America.  #ThisSucks #gonnaMissImportantEvent
106541,113525,Terrible experience trying to go from Buffalo to BWI on @SouthwestAir
106553,113537,.@united 3529 long wait to open door on arrival follows by missing luggage. So much for 1st class.
106555,113539,I miss the days when @AlaskaAir would serve warm scones and pass out pillows and blankets on your flight #theGloryDays
106564,113548,@DeltaAssist very disappointed asked for gold status match and it hasn't been done. After seeing your idea of service won't fly delta again
106569,113553,@JetBlue here we are again. Stuck in JFK bc of crew staff issue and all hotels are full. #terriblecustomerservice #uaboveallbs
106571,113555,Photo: @southwestair this was a lie #justlanded #delayed #ugh (at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)) http://t.co/VHYKNt7k2w

106596,113580,I love @VirginAmerica. I do not love sitting waiting for a gate at SFO.
106598,113582,Missed my flight thanks to the very rude @JetBlue employees at FLL. Thanks a lot
106601,113585,@VirginAmerica why did the crew on 221 block off the 3 back left seats and not let us spread out? I've never seen an airline do this.
106608,113592,@AmericanAir useless David tells me I have to ring central baggage in the US. You ruin my holiday . make me jump through hoops to get &lt;
106613,113598,Note to self. never fly with @united.
106616,113602,After all the horror stories I've heard from friends/family about traveling with @United. I'll do everything I can to never fly with them.

106633,113621,@SouthwestAir Salute  . Haven't had a bad experience with you guys yet . Keep it up !
106636,113624,@JetBlue It is assumed that the flight leaves at 4:20 am 7:27 am and are still not out. The plane has electrical problems. Flight 730 BQN
106637,113625,Thank you @JetBlue for great customer service! Probably the least stressful experience I've had. even with a cancellation!
106641,113629,@JetBlue errr... I hate to be picky but that's a mere photograph. not a selfie 
106644,113632,Never flying @united again! What a disasters. Cutover focus has been non existent. #thanksbutnothanks
106645,113633,. @AmericanAir why did you cancel the 6am LGA -&gt; MIA? Ruined my day.

106667,113657,Really disappointed with @JetBlue for a very inconvenient 4 hr delay at #MCO. especially since now I miss my connecting flight to #SFO 
106671,113661,The delay that @JetBlue has on our flight right now is ridiculous.... We were supposed to leave at 7:17am and now we won't leave till 11am
106673,113663,@united never wise for gate agents to have audible convo re: missing crew drama #ua1587 #pdxtoden #delayedboarding http://t.co/Ev0z8cJobi
106677,113669,"Flight 472 on time. Was in my seat. No first officer on board. Now we all de-plane and wait ""at least a couple hrs."" What?@DeltaAssist"
106682,113674,@united any updates on flight 3727 to charleston? Losing half a day of our trip because of this delay.
106684,113676,.@SouthwestAir is going to start flying to Coasta Rica?!? #gameover I cant wait!!!!!!
106687,113679,@JetBlue might as well make a Twitter and complain as I wait 7 hours in the bahamas airport
106697,113689,@united hi the pilot on the UA5732 from Dulles - Toronto is the best thing about your company. Made up for an hour delay with his humour!!
106699,113691,@DeltaAssist Trying to add infant in arms for flight today. I've been on hold for 25 mins on the phone so far.
106700,113692,There's a reason why I don't fly @AmericanAir unless forced to #worstairline

106720,113716,@JetBlue Cancelled flight. no transportation from BOS to ORH. Longtime JB fan.  Losing faith in JetBlue.  Disregard for Mosaic flier
106727,113723,@AmericanAir is my only option to really wait and see if this problem can be fixed for a hypothetical new departure at 11?
106729,113725,@VirginAmerica you guys suck. Made us miss our White House tour. Maybe next time you should have a few extra planes on hand.
106735,113731,@SouthwestAir Flight from MCI to BWI taking off late.  Please hold my 1:05 flight 1867 to NAS and don't leave without me!
106738,113735,"@JetBlue Usually love you guys. but my current delay to Boston (they're ""looking for a plane"") might make me late to a family funeral :("
106739,113736,@JetBlue Waiting to taxi to gate at O'hare 25 mins now they won't let me pee please hurry
106744,113741,I don't understand why @AmericanAir fails to offer vegetarian breakfast choices on non-transcont domestic routes. just leave out the sausage
106754,113752,Received an unexpected $100 travel credit for the long delay on Thursday out of #JFK. Thanks @JetBlue. This helps after a LONG day

106780,113782,@JetBlue my flight was cancelled on the way to LV and I have a flight back with you guys tomorrow... But I'm not in LV. What can I do?
106787,113789,@VirginAmerica I appreciate the update. but your tardy crew member's going to make my miss my uncle's funeral this AM http://t.co/5zJ6mefQW4
106788,113790,Why are we stuck on the tarmac in #Dallas @AmericanAir I'm going to miss my connecting flight!
106794,113796,@United Would have thought we would have been offered travel vouchers because of all the inconvenience &amp; added costs #bad business #goodwill
106798,113801,Love when the @JetBlue gate says we're delayed because they can't find the crew. #priorities
106801,113804,@JetBlue  Aw I wish I remembered her name! Either way. the whole team was great + I was very happy yesterday. Jetblue has never let me down!

107020,114035,It's official. @AlaskaAir has best customer service of all majors. Wheelchair assistance was even w/out issue. which is rare. sadly. Thanks!
107023,114039,@JetBlue how is it ok for an already delayed flight to board the plane. taxi to the runway then call everyone back to get off the plane??

107081,114103,@JetBlue You let a drunk guy board. He puked before boarding was over and we're delayed. Maybe you should've denied boarding at the gate.
107090,114112,Wait. does @SouthwestAir fly international now?
107098,114120,@JetBlue I'd love to know why flight from JFK to Chicago is delayed. Still blaming snow?

107133,114155,@united.  How's it possible that 75% of my united flts are delayed.  There's no rhyme or reason why?
107144,114166,@JetBlue never flew with you before but now I will! #ACPA15
107153,114175,Travel day from hell. I'm looking at you @AmericanAir
107166,114188,@AmericanAir Hello. per your website. I cannot cancel because it includes travel outside the US. Please help me cancel this
107167,114189,@united We just had to de-plane and there is no one here to address the issue at the desk.  Seriously?
107172,114194,I am leaving on @AmericanAir jet plane ... Miss you all and see you soon!
107184,114208,@AmericanAir when the prices in the hotel menu start at $35 why would you give us a $12 Boucher? Are you kidding?! #horribleservice
107188,114212,Missing LAX connection. but @DeltaAssist trying to find a way for me to get home tonight. Rolling with it.
107199,114224,Why does this @JetBlue plane smell like someone urinated on the seats and floor
107203,114228,Thanks for the FlyFi. @JetBlue! If only my TV would change channels and the guy next to me didn't smell #122
107204,114229,@united when the whole plane has been waiting for bags 45 minutes. you should at least come out and tell us what's going on...
107207,114232,@DeltaAssist can you fly with a photo copy of your ID if you've lost your wallet while traveling?
107222,114248,Really @united?! You lie about your prices and than your reps scream at me?! I guess I'll take my platinum status to a different airline
107224,114251,@AlaskaAir I am a bit upset. I booked a flight with Alaska airlines from LAX to BOS just to find out it was thru American. Not cool.
107225,114252,@JetBlue - thanks for getting my home to CHS. Couple of days late. But home.
107246,114277,@AmericanAir: Unfortunately this search tool is no longer available. If you would like to view our current deals and offers. please visit...
107247,114278,no worries @jetblue i still like you guys  -and that $50 credit for the delayed flight was very much appreciated _
107264,114296,@AmericanAir Re cancellation of flight 70. I know you can do better than getting our kids to Germany 2 days late for their school trip!
107274,114306,Two flights yesterday. One today. One tomorrow. Who the hell have I become? #luv @SouthwestAir
107279,114311,@DeltaAssist im when will I know if there's a delay for my trip from syr to oaj it's set to leave at 545am
107280,114312,Nashville.tn june 17-21 for UtopYA book CONVENTION.I'm a single mom who loves books and never gets a vacation  @JetBlue #FlyingItForward

107283,114315,@AmericanAir 2 flights delayed and luggages did not arrive with me.. No words.. #worstflight
107294,114329,As usual!@AmericanAir is NEVER on time.
107305,114340,@VirginAmerica Selina at IAD and Ellen at LAX.  Without them we would've never made our flight! #downunder
107308,114343,I've mastered my airport codes! Can't wait to start Monday and officially join the @AmericanAir AAdvantage Customer Svc team!
107318,114353,@AmericanAir I am dissatisfied with your product
107319,114354,@JetBlue beside someone kicking off and losing a DSLR angle lens thank you an amazing roundtrip flight from #JFK to #PuntaCana #JetBue !!!
107320,114355,@SouthwestAir Wait a minute. Southwest flies to Costa Rica?
107323,114358,@JetBlue never again
107341,114376,@AmericanAir i'll do that. At the end. two of our bags were violeted and stolen at Orlando airport. The lockers were thrown inside the bags
107349,114384,@SouthwestAir No one to check people in at LIT today?  A line as long as TX waiting for someone to show up!
107353,114388,@united can't board our flight because your late staff can't make it on time like the rest of us. Not once and you not caused problems.
107374,114412,@DeltaAssist too little too late as per normal.
107378,114416,Very impressed @SouthwestAir! Flight delayed because of medical emergency. but at connecting port AHEAD of schedule!
107390,114428,@JetBlue If Flight 1983 to Orlando is delayed because the in-flight crew didn't change their clocks to DST. how are you compensating us?
107407,114446,@DeltaAssist Need to get home to LGA &amp; have a maintenance issue w/our plane at MSP. Flying since 6 am &amp; no luck getting on next flight out.
107412,114451,Nice new plane @JetBlue ! Going from Terminal to plane. Wi-Fi switched automatically! Love the water bottle holder also. ;-)
107415,114454,@AmericanAir What's with the legroom on the 737 in coach?   #miserable http://t.co/VAypVLp1Am
107417,114456,Can't believe my buddy had $2500 worth of electronics &amp; gifts for his wife stolen on a layover while flying @AmericanAir. I feel so bad.
107419,114458,"So I took off and landed on time with no issues all trip. @JetBlue still is the only non ""screw Connor over"" airline. Great job #PAXEast2015"
107420,114459,@jetblue new problem. Trying to book trip and accidentally removed my partner from the family pool. They are telling me restricted for a yr
107421,114460,.@JetBlue__s plan to repair its #brand. #business #marketing #leadership http://t.co/pe3D6mQsbG
107429,114468,@DeltaAssist Today's DL5697.  Can you explain how this flight will leave on time from DFW? http://t.co/Y9ordKFYVd
107440,114479,Mom's flying tonight for the first time since 1987. She's really nervous. but can't wait to see her. @SouthwestAir please take care of her.
107441,114480,@AmericanAir I kinda feel bad for you guys. Every tweet you get is a complaint. Here. have some Ice Cream to cheer you guys up: _
107443,114482,_@SouthwestAir: Heart and skill. Period._ #InternationalWomensDay  Just say heart and skill. Most women would prefer to leave out the period
107445,114484,@DeltaAssist That doesn't make up for getting here at 4am unnecessarily. I am missing my son's play tonight. Don't you test your planes?
107452,114491,Hey @JetBlue. remember when you used to let people leave through the back of the plane? How come no more?
107453,114492,"Talked all weekend about how I never have issues flying @JetBlue . Naturally. our plane today ""has developed an issue"" and no backup. Jinx'd"
107456,114495,@SouthwestAir no. She wouldn't let me because she was convinced it wasn't southwest's fault
107459,114498,@SouthwestAir I had to fly with a different airline today instead of yall. Let me assure you that will never happen again. God Bless #SWA
107467,114506,"Wait. @SouthwestAir. age 2+up = an adult? Kids. when mom tries to send you to bed. say ""Southwest says I'm an adult!"" http://t.co/0SCy4FVDAn"
107486,114525,@AmericanAir I've been home 2 weekends in a row.  Having #AAWithdrAAwAAls.  ::sad kitty:: I miss y'all. Looking forward to LAX trip soon!
107487,114526,Our pilot is suuper late. So now the flight is delayed. we're supposed to be taking off right now. Not cool @AlaskaAir not cool. #NoPilot
107491,114530,My flight on @VirginAmerica is so bad that I feel like I'm being punk'd
107496,114536,"About to be ""that guy eating tuna"" on plane as I leave #ACPA15 Apologies @united flight 1024. #pescetarianproblems http://t.co/DPVsJWf21b"
107500,114540,Time change error on the @united iOS app made me nearly miss my flight. Lock screen alert moved up and shows 1hr later departure

107535,114577,@AmericanAir  upsetting to be told that my miles and money have been returned and I received an email telling me otherwise #BADSERVICE
107565,114609,@JetBlue how are your papers not digital? This is ridiculous! Thanks for not letting me off so I could switch flights #flight590 #needrefund
107569,114613,@AmericanAir i lost my sister at the airport she looks like this . please help http://t.co/yvf74D5Jut
107573,114617,Awesome @AlaskaAir pilot directed us to the #grandcanyon below. Amazing what you'll miss if you don't look! http://t.co/jfZTsyjbgT
107579,114624,@united What a mess made of frequent flier program awarding miles based on $ paid. Mar 1 begins the program to totally stick it to customers
107588,114633,@SouthwestAir Really Southwest?   You move the delay back to 2 pm and then push it up to 330.   Can't you track your own planes?  Disgusted!
107593,114639,@DeltaAssist bought tickets through Delta. Flew Alaska to Boston then Delta to Turks. Not their problem. YOURS!
107598,114644,I hate @AmericanAir
107599,114645,@JetBlue thanks for failing to notify me that my flight is 230 delayed.
107602,114648,@SouthwestAir just got kicked out of the first row on my connecting flight. guess being tall doesn't matter...I call b.s.
107604,114650,@JetBlue 590 still stuck at DCA. I've got a document imaging solution I'd like to sell you. http://t.co/CDiul0Krss it's 2015 folks
107609,114656,I don't see how @AlaskaAir can overbook up to 8 people on a plane and make us wait all day on standby...
107615,114662,@united bad Cust Serv. no amenities on trans Atlantic flights average wait time 40 minutes ok but filthy. #UANOMORE http://t.co/Ii8oBTLZxR
107619,114666,@americanAir failed me again. Recognized my platinum status but didn't as TSApre or get me on an earlier flight with open seats.
107624,114671,@SouthwestAir lost bag had my work stuff on a biz trip&amp;offering me $50 that didn't pay 4 cab ride 2pick up after the meeting happened  #fm
107636,114684,Buh-bye SoCal. gonna miss the weather. @JetBlue #jetBlueSoFly. See you back soon. http://t.co/873akY3kKt
107642,114691,@AlaskaAir Thank you for returning my drivers license lost on a flight about a month ago.  Very kind gesture of you guys.  I appreciate it!
107648,114697,@DeltaAssist the app is not working properly. It shows first leg upgrade list on the second leg list
107650,114699,@AmericanAir Would you let your 3 year old watch this? We didn't have a choice. #notokay #ChicagoPD not for everyone http://t.co/ohFHYJzhfZ
107656,114705,@DeltaAssist I have been waiting over a week for a response from Delta regarding mishandled flights.  Whats the deal
107661,114710,Got stuck in Houston on @united so spent some time researching logos for a work project. Found this one. &amp; fell in _ http://t.co/IbA2umYbks
107662,114711,This is why we can't have anything nice in this world. @JetBlue ruins my new luggage on first trip out. #jetblueblues http://t.co/0vw9PP04us
107666,114716,And...we're delayed. @JetBlue keep an eye on my connection! I'd rather not be stuck in NYC overnight.
107670,114720,@JetBlue another delayed flight 2701-what's going on?
107694,114744,@AmericanAir excuse me I have an issue
107696,114746,Heeey... @AmericanAir! If they cancel 2556 to DFW. can you put me back in Sam's Town casino for the night? ;) #SalemPressDay #thisismylife
107698,114748,Sad to say it but the new AA is becoming the best advertisement for the old Southwest. #@SouthwestAir #americanairlines
107701,114751,@DeltaAssist Please pass on to the app team that losing connecting flt info when leg 1 is delayed is annoying. 10m delay -&gt; 10m early!
107711,114761,@united in #flyhays waiting to start my trip to #Tucson. Can't wait for the best part: take off! http://t.co/KN0FNZ5bm3
107716,114768,@SouthwestAir you guys are awful. Everyone of your 3 flights I took today was delayed. First time I traveled southwest. First and last time.
107727,114779,The FACE when your flight is DELAY! LAS--&gt;SFO! Waiting game at @VirginAmerica http://t.co/OEmcFLUq5C
107735,114787,You know air travel has hit a new low when the best way to communicate with them after they cancel your flight is DM'ing @AmericanAir.
107746,114798,Sad to be leaving #cancun but this #flyfli on @JetBlue works amazing #thanks from 36.000 feet. Next stop #jfk T5
107754,114806,Haven't checked a bag in years because I am so paranoid about losing it. Did it on direct @JetBlue flight today &amp; bag went missing. Le sigh.
107764,114816,@AmericanAir why do you hate me
107770,114822,After miserable 5 hour delay out of LGA Friday. @JetBlue rolls into JFK from Tampa early tonight. Bonus: no wait at taxi stand.
107787,114840,Sunday afternoon cocktails waiting for flight #lax #virginamerica @virginamerica https://t.co/vpLTxs8U3e
107788,114841,My mans Jonathan from @SouthwestAir on the flight to Vegas killing it tho!
107791,114845,In good news. @JetBlue is always an amazing experience. I was sad to leave Tampa but at least I had an excellent flight to NYC.
107792,114846,@AmericanAir if im on a JAL international flight in FC when i land in SFO can i use a lounge while i wait for my AA domestic connection?
107805,114863,@AmericanAir I use other airlines now guys. You put me through to much traumatic stress.
107808,114866,@united explain why 4 flights in CLE all 737s are at same baggage carousel at same time. No other carousel used. 450 people waiting.
107834,114895,it must be a requirement that all @AlaskaAir personnel are rude today.
107838,114899,@DeltaAssist can someone from delta PM me ASAP about an inflight issue?
107843,114906,@SouthwestAir I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed http://t.co/fVRwKaVkJK
107854,114917,Seeing throwback #continental branding on a plane reminds me how much I miss that airline. @united just isnt the same http://t.co/1biRwgUJwt
107856,114919,@AmericanAir you guys are supposed to be the Latin America King and United is kicking your butt at BZE. Step it up !! http://t.co/KhGcybnmKL
107862,114925,@JetBlue Flight attendant Tyson totally made up for the slight delay tonight on flight 1951 BOS-MCO congratulate him on a job well done
107864,114929,Thank you @AlaskaAir for not only causing us to miss our flights and spend an extra 12 hours at airport. but also losing our bags. #Vacation
107868,114933,Watching airlines which focuses on @SouthwestAir. Which I had a major problem with recently. And I realized they just want to shut you up
107894,114962,Ready to rock a transcon @AlaskaAir flight tomorrow night!  Can't wait for 2A to SEA... Leave the snow in New England behind
107899,114967,So @JetBlue just canceled our flight home as soon as we were supposed to board. theres no flights tomorrow. and they're not comping anything
107900,114968,Screaming kids = free drinks! @AlaskaAir
107912,114981,@united how can you screw up an on time flight with earlier flight UA90 Tel Aviv not on time anymore bad planning organization skills
107922,114992,@AmericanAir just saying - I was in Dallas last Friday ! And that's the waiting time on the phone http://t.co/y9TqmYudyK
107927,114997,@VirginAmerica was told by flight attendant to tweet my complaint so... Why no provisions on VX357 BOS-&gt;SFO no snacks of any kind. Serious?
107930,115000,Uh what?! My 9:29pm flight back to NYC from SFO is delayed and rescheduled to 1:20am?! What's going on @JetBlue ?! :(
107934,115004,@JetBlue how soon in advance do I have to cancel a trip?
107939,115009,@AlaskaAir Thanks for taking such good care of us during the mechanical delay flight#229 outta PVR! #ClassAct
107946,115016,I think I found the issue with the @united app: it expects to scan US passport but won't let me change the nationality
107949,115019,@SouthwestAir I have been trying to reach a CS Rep for over 90 minutes. on 3 phone lines and no response at all! What's Going On???
107961,115031,.@DeltaAssist Waiting for take off on DELTA 813 from ATL - PHL after it made an emergency landing back in ATL due to a technical issue.
107963,115033,@AmericanAir excuse me but you damaged the best bassist in the world's luggage...I think you owe him an apology.
107967,115037,Flying @AlaskaAir tonight and I literally almost missed the flight bc the tsa line was a mile long..
107976,115046,Dear @AlaskaAir. Thank you for not destroying my precious SoCal cargo. Your portage skill will not be soon forgotten. http://t.co/2Qn3zkVSrf
107982,115053,@SouthwestAir what's up with baggage at BWI?  Waiting.
107984,115055,@SouthwestAir - waiting a long time to figure out why I'm not getting confirmation number emailed. http://t.co/P2JUpIGDMq
107985,115056,@JetBlue you made an #emergencylanding on #flight415 from #jfk to #sfo we're now in Sioux City Iowa waiting for hours where is the new plane
107987,115058,@SouthwestAir the hold times tonight were outrageous!  As one switching from another airline with Diamond status I am NOT impressed!
107992,115063,@VirginAmerica Having just completed a round trip with you. I have the #VXsafetydance stuck in my head. Wish I could watch it in first class
107997,115069,@JetBlue I love you guys. Can't wait to be reunited with ur beautiful cabin and crew in just a few weeks. ___
108002,115074,@DeltaAssist Hi I had a problem with Delta in Atlanta in February.  I sent in my complaint form and have nor received an answer. Next step?
108009,115081,Does anyone know why does @AmericanAir no longer operate direct flight between Los Angeles and Hartford.CT?
108013,115085,All I got was lies @united #NoWiFi http://t.co/uzDsVTVM0N
108017,115089,.@JetBlue how do u charge for a movie thats longer then the flight? #JetBlue #airlines
108018,115090,Tomorrow morning's flight was cancelled. Have been on hold w/ @SouthwestAir for 55 mins trying to re-book... is this hold time normal?
108032,115105,@DeltaAssist Believe I lost my passport on DL1707. Detroit &gt; Salt Lake City. Need it to travel back to Canada on Friday. can you help?
108037,115110,So upset about @VirginAmerica allowing me to select upgrade but it didn't push it out. can't wait to work in the middle seat. #stressedin9E
108044,115117,@AmericanAir I dealt with the most RUDE staff on my flight to Vegas for my 30th BIRTHDAY last week. Not to mention halfway through lunch...
108048,115121,Can't wait to email my HRM professor about my experience with @JetBlue. definitely impressed with JetBlue's attention customer satisfaction
108065,115138,@AmericanAir both flights last week delayed also.
108069,115143,@DeltaAssist what's the easiest way to report poor service from a particular delta rep?
108071,115145,6:50am. waiting game @jetblue. #filming #boom #Terminal5 #nyc #jfk #earlymornings #jetsetter #flex__ https://t.co/FYNKq7WJHx
108073,115148,Yeeeeees!!!!! @VirginAmerica is the BEST. I was late. but the still checked my bag and got me on the flight.
108084,115159,Starting to think I'm gonna be stuck in Nashville forever @AmericanAir
108085,115160,@JetBlue #921 nowhere to be seen. Already late. Not impressed.
108097,115173,First flight on @JetBlue will never again. Officially going to miss the layover. Vacation fucked.
108115,115191,@JetBlue When I try to call a Getaway agent I get transferred and then left on the line with no response. music. wait time. etc..Why!
108121,115199,@DeltaAssist any way to get on a different flight? Missed my SLC connection and looking at a long layover.
108123,115201,Insane that @AmericanAir will not let me cancel one flight leg without charging $600+. Other 3 legs remain the same. traveling to a funeral.
108125,115203,@DeltaAssist because it wouldn't switch on. Security reasons. But I wasn't warned of this before
108128,115206,When the @AmericanAir flight is boarding but then stops because of a maintenance issue... Let's hope this gets resolved.
108133,115211,Flying @VirginAmerica for the first time today. So I guess I'm no longer a Virgin virgin.
108135,115213,Stuck in Atlanta. unable to house-hunt bc @AmericanAir cannot get a car seat the 15 mins from ATL. AA staff lied 2 my face re delivery time.
108137,115215,Flabbergasted @AmericanAir 1st flight out from ORD/SFO is still 8:40am. Planes always packed. Desperately miss that 6am they used to run.
108155,115233,hi @SouthwestAir i just cancelled my flight ( # 8P88II ) do i have money back? o i can use the $190 to an future flight ? explain me please.
108160,115238,@AmericanAir flt 1417 has been delayed because they can't find the pilot. I'm 35 yrs of flying. over 1million miles THIS is a first
108169,115247,@AmericanAir you tell me where to send the detailed complaint and I will.
108172,115250,@SouthwestAir This could be the Segway killer we__ve been waiting! http://t.co/XmfzNOJUUW http://t.co/li6IOVe021
108178,115258,@AmericanAir if I had a RT reservation. and missed my departure. would you guys cancel or alter my return flight?
108193,115273,I bashed 'em before so give props too. @DeltaAssist solved last Thursday's travel problem. Better than a 2+ hr phone queue.
108226,115306,The secret is frequency - @SouthwestAir flight late - jump on an earlier one... #Luvit
108229,115310,why does @united always overbook their flights? 2/2 so far. lots of upset people.
108236,115318,"@united you have a bag for 30 minutes. break it and say ""tough luck. not covered"". You hate your customers THAT much? http://t.co/rVhurUje2C"
108241,115329,@united how much is it to switch my flight from Monday to Wednesday? wanting to stay longer with my friends in Ireland
108242,115330,@AmericanAir i'm still waiting on the confirmation email concerning my flight change
108249,115337,@DeltaAssist It has been longer than 30 days now. what is your process after this time?
108261,115350,@DeltaAssist You guys did this on my last trip in January. Is it no longer available? I've never had an issue before.
108269,115358,@united stop with all the useless announcements. It is getting annoying.
108273,115362,Mom finally cleared to fly after her stroke...too bad her @united voucher expired on the 1st. No exceptions...sad.
108277,115369,@JetBlue updates that aren't being made.. Hope I don't miss out on my transportation
108279,115371,@united #0220460553 we've been down this road. it's annoying the brand rep team has to get involved to get something done.
108280,115372,So it turns out Zone 2 is the fifth group to board the plane. Missing the @SouthwestAir experience today. #needmoreflightstoCLT
108282,115374,@DeltaAssist the piece of luggage never made it onto the plane. Hope to receive it by tonight
108286,115378,Stuck at JFK airport in NYC until 10:30 tonight because @JetBlue sucks. I want a refund for making me wait.
108291,115383,@AlaskaAir someone was meant to call me about my damaged bag. Nobody has. I'm flying again this afternoon.
108293,115385,@SouthwestAir I can't reach customer relations on phone (constant busy). Any other way to resolve an expiring travel credit issue?
108295,115387,Look how fancy you guys look on that classy watch! @AmericanAir can't wait to use that! http://t.co/g79MtzqStW
108302,115394,@JetBlue  having an issue with a flight I made for a friend.  Whats the refund policy?  But just for me. noone else?
108305,115397,SFO -&gt; LAX delayed. Every time I'm on the west coast my @SouthwestAir flight gets delayed. Never happens when in the east. Odd.
108306,115398,@SouthwestAir you are always delayed. #dontflysouthwest
108312,115405,I have been really sick for over 3yrs and haven't seen my family in buffalo for longer than that. Im always in bed @JetBlue #FlyingItForward

108328,115421,@DeltaAssist Do I need to call the 800 number to make a same day confirmed change to my reservation? I've been on hold a while
108340,115433,@United group 1 ord to sfo packed. Why do I buy 1st class. Any elite gets group 1 sucks
108350,115444,@DeltaAssist yes. I need to cancel it.
108351,115445,@AmericanAir waiting for a sale :)
108367,115461,@AmericanAir Your staff needs to do a better job of informing us of issues!
108373,115468,Alright let's try this again @united .. A whole day lost in travel ... Sigh
108375,115470,"@JetBlue what the heck? Cancelling a flight for ""maintenance""? Sounds like you didn't want to fly a nonfull flight! #PlansRuined #Stuck"
108380,115475,@VirginAmerica deep respect VX. Thanks 4 waiving my cancellation fee (as an exception) after VS cancelled my flight back to UK. #VXrocks!
108383,115478,@AlaskaAir it was a great flight. thanks! I'm rarely dissatisfied when I fly with Alaska. so another thanks! :)
108384,115479,Just flew on one of @united s new EMB175 ... Not bad
108386,115481,"@AmericanAir captain after on Tarmac for 1.5 hrs ""sorry for the stuffy air. can't get circulation till engines start"""
108403,115501,Oh @SouthwestAir I am sorry.... I strayed for one trip... I will never leave you again. #travel #traveldrama
108421,115520,@deltaassist I have been holding for 59 min to speak to a representative... Is there an issue with your lines? #Delta #DeltaAirlines
108422,115521,Got this postcard in the mail for a scam. @SouthwestAir folks should be upset as no SWA plane pic was used for card. http://t.co/hUDSWrRagu
108436,115535,@VirginAmerica i am a premium visa card member. if i book a flight with points. can i still cancel without any fees?
108437,115536,@DeltaAssist and be told to call a number and be put on hold
108439,115538,@AlaskaAir how many hrs does a flight need to be delayed until you guys have any sense of good customer service and give real info on status
108446,115545,I think it says something when you have no problem picking @SouthwestAir as the number 1 spot in all the #FreddyAwards airline spots.
108448,115547,And then you fly @JetBlue out of T5 and remember why you hate all other airlines and especially their terminals at JFK. #jetting #JetBlue
108456,115555,"Can't wait to fly with you guys again!! ""@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/OIxLJcxXtg"
108457,115556,@AmericanAir still waiting. seems like over a week is not very responsive.

108483,115582,Grr!!!! My @SouthwestAir back to Minneapolis is delayed :(
108487,115586,That moment when you realize you've had your @United mileage plus number 30 years.. and that's longer than you've had a SSN!
108489,115588,Also thanks to our longtime sponsor @JetBlue . we could've never done any of this without you #RIPSFHL
108491,115590,@AlaskaAir poor communication.  When asked if my original seat was avail...no.first class conf....maybe...upset 75k..yes
108498,115597,@SouthwestAir always runs late. I fly frequently and every single time I encounter this problem.
108499,115598,A trip to go visit my grandpa in Florida turned bust thanks to @JetBlue and their ridiculous delays. He's gonna be so disappointed.
108500,115599,"I will never fly @SouthwestAir again!!! You broke my damn bag and then when I report it you say ""oh we don't cover it"". You all suck."
108501,115600,Yo @SouthwestAir Magazine. bring back the Hard crossword puzzle! (or send travel voucher for inconvenience of doing just the Easy+3 sudokus)
108502,115601,@VirginAmerica your $50-80 first class upgrades rock! If we can help it we never fly any other airline! Keep up the great work! #WeHeartYou

108512,115613,@JetBlue why do you ruin lives?
108516,115618,@JetBlue Flt #454 still has 'new plane' smell...or is that just new interior of plane smell?
108519,115622,@JetBlue fortunately the awesome flight cree got us to the destination. But both flights delayed a combined 2 hrs. Not a good way to start
108532,115635,@united: I am so sorry for angry tweet! I tagged the wrong airline. #ShameOnMe #sosorry #ironic
108536,115639,@SouthwestAir delayed in Orlando. Tell me a funny joke while a wait!

108718,115836,@VirginAmerica - is it just me. or is the add to passbook button broken on the boarding pass page? I press it and nothing happens.
108726,115844,"@united how are those ""investigations"" going?  Or did I waste my time dm'ing you w/ info since you lied and never intended to look into them"
108741,115859,So our @united flight has a check engine light on and we may miss our connection. Really looking forward to this. *headdesk*

108750,115871,@AmericanAir After many years of being my preferred airline. you have lost a customer. #heartless #tonedeaf http://t.co/oX75MWozLU
108757,115878,.@VirginAmerica destroying my long-time love of co. Trying to book flights to see a dying family member &amp; have most unhelpful rep ever.
108759,115880,Obviously he's never watched a @SouthwestAir commercial
108770,115891,@AmericanAir the flight number was 102 - HNL to FTW. we took off and landed eventually. but not before we missed 2 connecting flights.
108778,115900,@united are you going to hire more ground crew? staff at EWR says 45 min is the wait for bags because they don't have enough ground crew.
108779,115901,@JetBlue Still waiting for more flights out of BWI... maybe to Cali?
108794,115917,Stuck on the runway in Chicago for 45 minutes on @AmericanAir. Why? No answers. Now I'll miss my flight home.
108796,115919,@JetBlue this mint seating looks awesome. Can't wait to get flight going. Can we get to LA in 4 hours ?
108799,115922,@AmericanAir 2 ticket nmbrs. Original with 001 but baggage  tracks to 037 tkt for USAwys. Not able to find full 13 digit. This is insane.
108800,115923,I'm flying @DeltaAssist on Sunday. and I'm going to have a real issue if they close my gates early again.
108801,115925,@AlaskaAir Flight 850 was a pleasant one today but bags were a little slow. How do I use baggage guarantee?

108805,115929,@DeltaAssist Is there an issue with the mobile app? Not able to log in via Android or iPhone. Even tried password change.
108806,115930,@DeltaAssist this app is terrible. I am trying to rebook. because your airline left PHL late and I am going to miss my connection.
108814,115938,@JetBlue FYI the Jetblue app is still not compatible with my device. Nexus 6 launched in Nov.  This is ridiculous.
108818,115942,Off to sunny SoCal again. @VirginAmerica. You've ruined me for other airlines. Fortunately. they won't miss me.
108825,115950,Idk why we fly @SouthwestAir anymore. We always say never again. but we keep ending up on these bs flights
108826,115951,@DeltaAssist rethink booking only 1hr connection 2 JFK from Sydney thru LAX. Or have bottle of water and a sweat rag waiting when I board 
108827,115952,I'd like to fly to New Orleans and work to repair the shorelines and habitats along the gulf coast.  Still oil. @JetBlue #FlyingItForward

108840,115966,@united I've now been on the phone with you guys for 45 min explaining why I'm not paying for your tech error #worstcustomerservice
108848,115974,Always flying @SouthwestAir going forward! After being 40 min late out of MKE. they held my connection in STL so I could make it!
108853,115979,What's the hold up W the airline..It's clear my luggage is a wrap. Literally come on @AmericanAir they destroyed it http://t.co/1X0UJHboKo

109400,116560,"@SouthwestAir I saw the line but it was closed...""not enough staff"" was their excuse"
109409,116569,I've heard so many bad things about @united its not even funny
109411,116571,@AmericanAir Perhaps better preparation for know weather issues would prove it's more than words. Flight #5724
109413,116573,Somewhere between Ft Myers Fl and Atlanta Ga- this breathtaking view never gets old ! @SouthwestAir http://t.co/tqjFWsEJn9
109418,116578,You stay fucking up. @united

109489,116649,Can__t wait for @United to start the Group 2 Deathmatch since there are 2x more Group 2 passengers than overhead spots
109494,116655,Boo-hoo! I have a long wait at LGA and there is no 1st class @VirginAmerica lounge.  (Sniff)
109498,116659,.@VirginAmerica It's my first flight ever with you to Dallas on number 717. Can't wait!
109499,116660,Wait!? Does @SouthwestAir really offer flights to Costa Rica now!?
109516,116678,@united term A at EWR is at least 100 degrees. Kill me. 
109523,116685,Don't mind going a little out of our way to fly back to IAD from Vegas in a couple weeks JUST to fly @VirginAmerica. Our family can't wait!
109543,116706,We are sorry but the pilots are illegal to fly. Grateful for regulations but bummed I might not make it to DC on time/today. @DeltaAssist
109546,116710,@SouthwestAir  give Bob Woudstra back his money. Its your fault your systems failed to register his boarding . I wonder about your security
109550,116714,Lost bags. Deleted first class tickets. Late flights. Deleted trip 1/2 way through. Opened a twitter account just to say this @united
109560,116725,@DeltaAssist Flt 1490 is a disaster. DTW to LAS. Flight was delayed bc of jet bridge now we are stopping in SLC to switch pilots??
109572,116737,@DeltaAssist the one time I checked bags today it took longer than 20 mins to come off the belt in PHX. How do I claim my bonus miles?
109573,116738,Oh my gosh!! Third time trying to call @DeltaAssist and on the phone for 45 mins and no answers! What is this? #poorcustomerservice #bad
109584,116750,God bless @SouthwestAir and their #inairwifi option. My texting addiction need not suffer.
109587,116753,@VirginAmerica I've never had a bad experience on Virgin America. Leg room. though. could be better on all airlines :-)  #tallperson
109612,116779,Been waiting to check in for my @AlaskaAir in Eugene for almost 45 minutes_theres been no one at the check in desk. This is pretty insane_
109618,116786,@AlaskaAir never a good flight to do this on. but the SLC flight were you are fighting with Delta....just input for consideration
109635,116804,If I never fly southwest again. it will be too soon #worstflightever @SouthwestAir
109646,116816,"@JetBlue The ""fun"" of flying with you continues. I can't wait until I have your customer service on the phone tonight after this trip."
109650,116820,Ok. now you're just pushing my buttons Virgin... Delayed landing too?!? Come on!! @VirginAmerica
109651,116821,@jetblue Why was JetBlue flight 1201 out of JFK last Thursday at 8pm cancelled at 3am after promising the full plane load it wouldn't be?
109656,116851,I spent a lot of $$ morbidly obese man 500 lbs next to me on @AmericanAir flight.  I can't move really??  Bad airline
109658,116853,after a 5 hour delay. finally on a plane headed back to #vegas. ohh and $200 for a future trip.. hmmm where to go.. #thankyou @SouthwestAir

109706,116902,"@AlaskaAir 8 hours of a wasted day. yes. But I would also appreciate not paying a change fee on a flight I was 44 min early for yet ""missed"""
109709,116905,@DeltaAssist so... no feedback on my issue?
109712,116908,@Jetblue Missed out on a R/T deal from NYC to Miami by waiting one day. Almost had R/T at a one-way fare...
109722,116918,@VirginAmerica where can I request missing flight credit?
109729,116925,@americanair flew frm LAX to YYZ yesterday n a souvenir went missing. This is BS! I knw exactly where I packed it n that suitcase was opened
109733,116929,@AmericanAir very disrespectful the ladies in this number when I tried to solve a problem with my ticket 01152(55)52091400 (Mexico)
109742,116939,Babies just can't stop screaming about @jetblue mint. Ask me how I know.
109746,116943,@AmericanAir Scout Cantrell's refund was handled so poorly. it is too late. damage is done
109752,116950,I knew it wasn't just my imagination. @united really is late all of the time. http://t.co/GUKGNFylAl
109753,116951,@united Here's ANOTHER reason why I NEVER fly on your airline. https://t.co/hzSWKN1eKw
109759,116957,Why @united do you cancel so many #CLE flights? I booked w/ you bc you had the times I wanted. 2 kids+2 layovers=inconvenience
109780,116981,@SouthwestAir yes. actually there is. I have a flight in August. can you cancel it and refund my money ?
109793,116995,@DeltaAssist hi - I had cm switched seats to an exit row through the mobile app but when I boarded they switched me to a non exit row seat.
109794,116996,@AmericanAir too bad your planes are aways breaking down and delayed
109796,116998,After being disconnected 5 times by @AlaskaAir automated system i am still on hold 10 min later and havent spoken to anyone. Awesome
109797,116999,@JetBlue I love when my my brand new first time being used checked luggage is broken after flying Jet Blue 
109803,117005,This plane is gigantic &amp; mad fancy. One of the many reasons I only fly @SouthwestAir. http://t.co/dTLUQ3LL1G

109806,117009,Some of the @AmericanAir complaints are crazy. I flew American from LAX today and didn't see a single celebrity. I need a full refund now!
109809,117012,Just booked @SouthwestAir DAL-LAX 3/27/15. Can't wait! _____#socalgal #PBinLA
109820,117023,@DeltaAssist  you really need to call me as soon as possible.  I have never found it so difficult to take a trip with six people in my life!
109826,117030,Totally irritated with @SouthwestAir for loosing my luggage today. I lost a whole day in Vegas over this mess! 
109828,117032,Disappointed that we won't be flying @JetBlue this trip but when their cheapest flights are $1100 more than southwest we just can't.
109830,117034,@SouthwestAir lost my wife's bag today which included her $350 maid of honor dress for her best friends wedding this weekend! #airlines
109832,117036,Why cancel all the direct MIA-LAS flights @AmericanAir ??  Always had ~11am/noon and ~2/3pm... don't exist anymore _ #goldproblems #aa
109836,117040,@AmericanAir it's only bad because I would have flown British Airways instead had I known. EQM for EXP are hard to come by!
109839,117043,If you're looking for the rudest people in America just board a @SouthwestAir flight to anywhere...
109840,117045,@AmericanAir Still waiting 4 answer on complaints for discrimination from busyness class due to fare paid!!!! What to solve this in Court?
109841,117046,Another mama having problems #breastfeeding on the #airlines. Time for employee training. @united. http://t.co/jY2r9NOWBi
109856,117061,Treatment of the nursing mother on the United flight is so sad. I nursed on my @AlaskaAir flight yesterday. received nothing but smiles.
109858,117063,@AmericanAir if my flight with you has a 10hr layover in london. can i leave the airport during that time to see london?
109861,117067,I've never used @SouthwestAir but we'll see how this goes!
109889,117096,@VirginAmerica was so sad to see inflight service is optional by your FA's on late flights. Slipping.
109890,117097,@AlaskaAir Don't assume it's ok to switch my seat with someone after boarding without asking me. That's the point of having status.
109892,117099,Hoping @AlaskaAir fixes their problem of overbooking and gives me my seat back by the morning. #PayingCustomer #WillGetToVegas
109895,117102,@DeltaAssist - on the SkyMiles phone # trying to change my flight &amp; have been hearing music for past 25 mins. Are wait times that long?
109900,117108,@DeltaAssist No help on phone sup. either. 3 calls. 30 min wait each. They couldn't see itineraries that are on http://t.co/71PZP7RCtp
109908,117116,Literally in the middle of a transaction with @SouthwestAir online. and it fails to go through because one leg suddenly jumped $20. :(
109912,117120,Lol. never fly @united
109918,117126,@DeltaAssist Hello. the problem is I do not have it. I did not save it. but I can provide you with the credit card number I used
109923,117131,When @SouthwestAir doesn't let you switch planes because your boyfriend got a different plane but the same flight and departure time 
109934,117142,@AmericanAir is there usually decent availability this way? Trying to decide to grab the aisle seats left rather than be stuck in middle :)
109936,117144,@united gotta say...not impressed. Missing my platinum status w Delta
109942,117150,@DeltaAssist purchased 2 tickets last week and now this week each ticket is $26 cheaper. They will not refund the difference. _ #FAIL

110221,117440,Random thought of the day; I__m limiting all travel to @JetBlue destinations. They  actually gave me a credit for a delay. Great CS retention
110233,117452,Ok. ok @AmericanAir. I kept trying to defend you. but you finally convinced me. You ARE the worst airline. #hateinmyheart4you

110267,117489,@JetBlue You may want to look into this matter. There was a very ugly scene and the PA was called in. Seven hour wait that was AVOIDABLE!

110512,117748,@DeltaAssist is there a way to make an exception and cancel a ticket and issue it as a credit? Or refunded. #nothappy
110513,117749,Every time I saw I will never fly @united again and every time i have to. I regret it. #delaysondelaysondelays #andnothelpful

110525,117761,oh and the fact i have 700$ of alaska air gift cards but they never seem to let me use them lol @AlaskaAir
110526,117762,@JetBlue no one has contacted me. RCUSKL is my new confirmation # can you switch me to the later flight that lands at jfk at 7pm...
110527,117763,@SouthwestAir confirmation #8TX427 it had nothing to do with the pilots. they were rockstars! We just had some bad WX. #iflyswa
110531,117768,Hey @SouthwestAir my teammates were delayed 3hrs today (flight#619).  Missed our game. No compensation for them? Really? You can do better.
110535,117773,@united Can you help me with a rescheduled itinerary? It's two months out &amp; now I'm going to miss shows I bought non refundable tickets for.
110544,117783,Dont waste your time tweeting probs to @united. Act like they want to help to save face. but in reality do nothing about it. Read their feed
110550,117790,@AlaskaAir My flight is delayed on my phone and in the airport all the signs say ON TIME!??!?! I know I should ask but signs don't work
110553,117793,@AmericanAir been waiting 30min to deplate . What the heck !!! Seriously? You guys need better flow management
110557,117797,@AmericanAir CAN YOU PLEASE WAIT FOR ME. YOU DID NOT GIVE MY LAY-OVER ENOUGH TIME. JUST LANDED AND PLANE WILL TAKE OFF IN 20 MINUTES
110561,117801,@DeltaAssist Flew ATL-LIT on 3/9 in the new Comfort+ class and seat wouldn't recline. And now Gold has to pay for this? Very disappointed.
110566,117806,@JetBlue flight 310 SDQ-JFK cancelled. No reason given. Losing time for the New York #halfmarathon
110583,117824,@united YO Something on this plane is smelling so bad everyone is gagging. PLZ send air freshener
110594,117835,@united bad fix to left arm rest on UA1190 seat 4E. Arm rest does not lay flat. Needs attention.  #unsatisfactory http://t.co/CVhEXOHRaf
110596,117837,@United first off ...I hate you
110597,117839,@AmericanAir is all about efficiency! 5 agents at TSA precheck. 1 at std security. I may miss a flight but they won't miss their Netflix !
110599,117841,@JetBlue I flew another airline recently and had a horrible experience...  I will never stray again. sorry Jetblue
110607,117849,@united utilities home serve charge 89yr old Alzheimer's sufferer _388 for annual home emergency cover. Dreadful.
110608,117850,First leg is gonna land at 855 (on time) but other legs are delayed 2.5hours. Tired @SouthwestAir pilots ? http://t.co/2AXtPajvHk
110614,117857,Cant fault @AmericanAir for cancelling THIS flight. #davidsdateline #onthefifties  http://t.co/FlIHbhiarb
110617,117860,On hold @jetblue few inquiries travel
110633,117876,@AmericanAir. given the non-weather cancellation. I feel I should get to wait in the Admirals Club lounge while I wait...but okay.
110641,117884,Airplane pet peeve: broken overhead lights. Come on @AmericanAir. it's dark outside. cabin lights are off. and I have work to do!
110645,117888,Got to airport at 4:30 AM for 5:45 flight back home to my family... &amp; still no plane. Getting ugly up in here @united. Lots of upset folks!
110646,117889,My gear was found! unclear how a big case of gear can be lost at 1 airport for multiple days but I hope @AmericanAir had a jam session w/ it
110654,117897,So LaGuardia has no TSA precheck line and this is what security looks like.  @SouthwestAir was wildly rude about it http://t.co/jRp83wnYPi
110661,117904,@AlaskaAir anytime. wish I had the opp to fly in US more with you'!  But my friend is very happy with his full time switch!
110665,117908,"Sorry @SouthwestAir. but you really need to start doing assigned seating. The whole ""wildwest"" thing no longer works in today's world"
110668,117911,F_k! Woke up late and missed my @united flight. Hope the people at the gate don't dick me over. _ https://t.co/8tdRO768uP
110676,117923,@AmericanAir sad that they could not resolve their error with what was misspoke by a rep. Will expect a full letter written regarding this.
110677,117924,@DeltaAssist I fly home tomorrow from Zurich. Is it too late to ask for a #glutenfree meal? Is that even an option? Totally forgot to check!
110699,117947,@DeltaAssist your agents were  rude to my crying mother &amp; were unhelpful in re-booking our flights for a funeral. http://t.co/K3mBHEsx6e
110708,117956,@DeltaAssist I missed my flight at 8:45am and I missed the first standby flight by 2 minutes because it left early now I'm still on standby
110709,117957,She wouldn't stop talking the whole time!!! Oh wait. that must have been me. @southwestAir__ https://t.co/TD9MLasseB

110768,118019,Have been stuck on a runway for the last hour and a half and @AmericanAir won't let us off the 80 degree plane.
110781,118034,I never feel this way on @SouthwestAir http://t.co/YPlkiMriMM
110787,118041,@SouthwestAir if i book flight today. what is the penalty if i have to cancel within 24 hours? f no penalty. is the refund in cash or credit
110789,118043,@AmericanAir flew to Nashville after having to convince your agent we could and rented two vehicles to drive 415 miles home. Too late.
110792,118046,@virginamerica - i so &lt;3 u guys. but gogo on sfo - jfk flight is killing me right now. twitter is the only page i managed to load.
110793,118047,@JetBlue is the absolute bomb. Major kudos to Ashley and Jeff from flight 23 to LA. They hooked us up and started our trip off the best way.
110800,118055,@AmericanAir I'll never fly with your airline again!!! Between me. my husband and 2 other friends flights were missed because of your staff
110805,118060,@AmericanAir hi. my husband lost his sun glasses on flight#634 from Phoenix to Los Angeles. it is a gift. can you find it ?
110807,118062,@DeltaAssist Very frustrated with Delta's reservations as I cannot get written confirmation verify our pets are traveling with us.
110823,118080,@VirginAmerica I think I left my Nintendo 3DS on board my flight back to LA. IM SO SAD _ Who can I contact at LAX? Tried calling. no luck!
110824,118081,Don't think @united is planning on keeping this plane flying much longer http://t.co/JesSIUMm9E
110826,118083,Waiting on our delayed flt to Vegas.  Guess we get to keep our $$ a few minutes longer. @AlaskaAir #iflyalaska
110829,118086,@VirginAmerica I need to cancel the the return portion of an itinerary. Can I do this online? I think I can only cancel the entire itinerary
110832,118089,"@AmericanAir Someone please tell me what is a ""weight load"" issue and why AA 1767 is camped on the runway at RSW with no engines on."
110840,118097,@AmericanAir Been on hold for an hour. Mother was bumped from flight despite paying early for upgrade. Reservation number BVTDN3
110843,118100,@SouthwestAir why is flight 194 den to Kansas City delayed? 4:55 to 6:20 :(

110878,118135,Fellow passenger got harassed on my @JetBlue flight by a drunken man the flight attendant kept bringing drinks to. Not impressed.
110879,118136,@JetBlue i have ALWAYS stood by you guys and use you constantly. what took place today on flight 526 is absolutely ridiculous.
110899,118158,MSP to SFO and the way back has taken longer than my normal trips to India. Canceling all future travel plans. Never again! @AmericanAir
110909,118169,@DeltaAssist Is ur website down? I've typed in entire family's info 3x &amp; it can't process. Should i keep trying or wait until bug is fixed?
110910,118170,Apparently @united won't let you look at bad woodworking mid flight http://t.co/fVcdUPju1j
110911,118171,Why do you have everyone stand and get in line then wait 20+ minutes to start boarding? @SouthwestAir
110915,118175,I missed the announcement that @AlaskaAir is flying into JFK now. That's amazing!
110925,118187,@DeltaAssist I was never emailed our flight I for tomorrow. and need the info ASAP. Trouble calling out and waiting for call backs!
110937,118199,Dang it. @SouthwestAir. your delayed flight out of SFO this evening is gonna cost us a birthday dinner in Redondo Beach!! I'm SO MAD at you!
110940,118202,Upgrade cleared at T72. Thanks @AlaskaAir #iflyalaska having a grand time in #NewOrleans will be sad to leave! #beignets #crawfish #friends

110952,118216,On yesterday's flight home. @AlaskaAir bumped me out of my selected aisle seat to 32F - the last row window seat on a full plane. UGH!

110975,118239,@AmericanAir STILL ON HOLD http://t.co/mE2UzuqxFm
110976,118241,@AmericanAir If you're going to allow US Air to operate as a dumpster fire. why even bother. Zero chance of scheduling around a flight.
110980,118246,"@AmericanAir lets see. Airline error caused me to miss my connection. Flight they ""reaccomodated"" me with made me miss work AND left me"
110982,118248,@AmericanAir Boom!!!!! 4-11-15      wait on it .
110984,118251,Oh how I wish I was on a @VirginAmerica flight right now. Delayed on tarmac for crew unavailability and no way to pre-order a drink. Grrr
110988,118255,@SouthwestAir Didn't realize you give up boarding status when traveling with 11 Year Old? He's companion and it's never happened before.
110991,118258,@JetBlue Hi! Third phone call in two days. on hold for 15 mins+. all I want is an emailed receipt so I can keep our expenses team happy.

111014,118283,@united I cannot articulate how frustrating it is to see an open seat online. only to have a representative tell me it's unavailable.
111020,118289,@JetBlue - Looking for passenger. I have something that he lost.
111035,118306,.@VirginAmerica flight attdt just basically performed a Beyonc version of safety video. She needs a raise. never seen everyone so engaged.
111040,118311,@JetBlue withdrawal to the max. Midway is nothing like T5 and having to fly another airline for business = nightmare #delayed #FridayThe13th
111047,118318,How are going over sell a flight and expect someone to wait until tomorrow to catch another flight? Come on now @AmericanAir

111057,118328,Once again. @SouthwestAir wants me to be loaded before boarding. Keep the Guinness coming while we wait!
111066,118337,I am officially boycotting @SouthwestAir! I have never had a flight on time out of SFO. Cheap tickets aren't worth the hassle.
111076,118347,"@united you overbooked in buffalo. ny and left my son with ""happens all the time"" never offered if anyone wanted to step off"
111077,118348,"Captain: ""The paperwork takes longer than the fix."" Sure. we can fly through the air at 500mph. but we can't process paperwork. @united"

111107,118379,@AmericanAir you never cease to amaze me! Yet another #customerservicefail  our return flt you rebooked us on puts us on the last row.
111111,118383,@JetBlue I've never flown w/ you guys before. but bc of your Twitter account. I promise to. You've brought a  to my face today. Thank you!
111112,118384,@JetBlue Emailed earlier today. still haven't gotten a response. I just CS. the not so friendly rep refused to connect me to mgmt. Not good!

111341,118622,@SouthwestAir now that we're 30+ mins late. the pilots joke about the oxygen masks supplying alcohol isn't so funny. #2225
111357,118672,@AlaskaAir you should train your employees how to do their jobs. She had one task. And I missed my flight because of it.
111365,118681,The @SouthwestAir check in line is HUGE! Clear outside the door to wait. Is it mean that I don't want to let ppl cut that didn't plan ahead?
111370,118686,@AmericanAir no matter how much he wanted it.I would never feed the gross beef enchilada to my dog.First class u say? http://t.co/j1GJ1Dbsb5
111374,118690,@JetBlue 2 flight cancelations and a later mechanical delay out of NYC.  No help from jetblue to make his cruise.
111377,118693,I can't wait to take a journey in her one day @AmericanAir &lt;3 http://t.co/rTDr7sOZcv http://t.co/an0gGlNnZn
111383,118700,@SouthwestAir wasn__t able to find my lost item. but I did myself. It was in the airport lost and found. #facepalm

111390,118707,In the ol' #MSDYNGP consulting daze. I had complimentary/preferred seating on @SouthwestAir ...no longer.  'B17' isn't exactly up there.
111395,118712,@SouthwestAir managed to loose my bag on a nonstop flight. :\ Hoping it comes in before I have to leave again in a day or so.
111403,118720,First time flying with @AmericanAir tomorrow. Seat 01A on the 77W! Cannot wait! LHR&gt;MIA&gt;LAX - See you soon America _

111421,118739,@SouthwestAir Bad form forcing me to install a new version of your app just to look up flights. Hope it's b/c you got a new tech team
111433,118751,@AmericanAir now my daughter is stuck in LAX not a sugar flight to DC on any airline!  Tickets still for sale....
111434,118752,@JetBlue mama says who needs the friendly skies when you have Mint Skies. Can't wait to see my mama. Fly safe http://t.co/3qO7Fo4FAH
111441,118759,.@AmericanAir Why does US Airways' system kick you off when call volume is high and not allow you to wait? 1/2
111447,118766,Declining a $450 credit from @SouthwestAir for volunteering a travel delay pains anyone who has #wanderlust.
111468,118789,@AmericanAir Hello! Do you have any aisle or window seats I could switch to on AA 2402 from DFW to FLL tomorrow?
111474,118795,@united no need to we were late missed meeting. Very dissatisfied customer that will start looking else where. Very bad communication United
111482,118804,Shout out to @SouthwestAir for yet again leaving late. 2nd time in a week I've left late. Come on guys I know you can do better.
111483,118805,I am reminded of why I don't usually fly [airline redacted]. Can't wait to get back on @SouthwestAir for the return leg. #pretzelsplease
111486,118808,@united complained many times. Waste of my time
111488,118810,@VirginAmerica is there any hope to see regular service in Denver? #sigh
111493,118815,@AmericanAir what has happened to the flight from LAX to San Fransico  that was scheduled to leave at 9am and now only leaving at 4pm .
111501,118824,A complimentary beer or wine only on flights without beverage service? Way to #fail. @AlaskaAir .
111508,118831,@AmericanAir 1:55 flight now scheduled to leave at 2:57 while we wait on the Tarmac. What's the likelihood I make my connection?
111514,118838,@DeltaAssist is there a number I can call on the weekends with a complaint?
111515,118839,@VirginAmerica I love the modern feel when checking in at San Francisco with music blasting out! Can't wait to see what the plane is like!
111518,118844,@JetBlue Have a cold. taking decongestants. echinacea. vitamin c and an antibiotic. Will I have a problem with them in my carry on tomorrow?
111527,118854,Let's hope that we get our 6 bags before we leave for Port-Au-Prince tomorrow or there will be a few very unhappy girls. @AmericanAir
111547,118874,@AmericanAir my fiances baggage from DFW to Jackson. MS is lost and trying to talk to a human about it is near impossible #nothappyatall
111552,118880,@AmericanAir Yikes!  This was waiting for me at my seat today AA34. Lax-Jfk http://t.co/CT5nxNXglb
111554,118882,"@AmericanAir lost baggage phone number: please wait ""for 42 to 59 minutes"".  I would think that's the ONE line they would staff sufficiently"

111562,118890,Thank you thank you @jetblue for doing everything in your power to ensure I made my flight which I nearly missed.
111563,118891,@AlaskaAir link not working?
111573,118902,@AmericanAir lost my status and now no TSA precheck? Do I need to add my global entry to AAdvantage account and or res?
111589,118920,As God as my witness. I'll never not fly @JetBlue again. #LearnTheLesson

111626,118962,@AmericanAir: usair flight 1740 is now delayed 3 hours. What city is the incoming plane coming that there is such an issue?
111641,118977,.@united actually I can watch it in the airport since our flight is delayed... And made us miss our connecting flight.
111647,118983,@united awaiting aircraft? Im sitting on it. Typical http://t.co/rhbpD8Nu38

111673,119011,@DeltaAssist Stuck on plane in Atlanta!  Better hold all our flights!  How could a door being locked be such a screwup?!? 25 min so far.
111682,119020,@DeltaAssist is bae for not charging me to switch to an earlier flight.  Here I come sd!
111683,119021,@DeltaAssist Hey! Flying tomorrow with a friend. Is it too late to add her confirmation number as a companion for upgrades?
111688,119026,@united you're my preferred carrier but your new way of earning award miles is AWFUL. I just flew 5k miles and only earned 707 off that leg!
111695,119033,@AmericanAir I buy tix on ur site need to cancel u mail me paper voucher &amp; can only be used in person or via snail mail?! #BackToTheFuture
111701,119040,@SouthwestAir im glad you take peanut allergies seriously but maybe a policy can be in place about fish/seafood! Had a problem today
111704,119043,@DeltaAssist still waiting #delta.
111709,119048,4 flight delays followed by a flight cancellation. Stuck overnight at Newark's airport. Smooth @united. real fucking smooth
111723,119064,Problem Not Resolved BUT @DeltaAssist working on it &amp; I can tell they too are seriously distressed by potential impact of lost Bags-Thanks!
111739,119081,@JetBlue I've been waiting at the jfk baggage claim longer than my flight from Boston.
111740,119083,OMG @DeltaAssist . more problems! I left my coat on flight 1584... Any chance I can get that back?
111742,119085,Hey @united What the heck happened on my flight tonight from IAD to ATL. CDC took someone of no answers I missed my connection because of it
111753,119096,Ok so the visiting soccer team gets their bags off the plane first. First class passengers still awaiting @AlaskaAir #fail
111761,119104,@SouthwestAir I cheated on you with Delta. Sorry. can you forgive me? may I ride in your roomy. non arrogant planes again?!
111767,119110,@united why can't me and my son of 8 years old receive an upgrade to first class in case of delay? You give cookies and beverages instead?
111768,119111,@AmericanAir I'm really upset with the service I have received today
111769,119112,@JetBlue #pointsforsurveys is a scam. Promise 400 points but no eligible survey. Now I will get spammed. Thanks! Shame on you #jetblue
111771,119114,@AmericanAir Suggestions on how to get my kid home since you failed to deliver his car seat? #angrystevetweets http://t.co/bk7mqZ9B3o

111822,119174,Why are your planes always broke @americanair?  Last 3 trips you struck out for my family. Basic airline requirement: be able to get there.
111848,119201,@united yes they did. That was not my issue. We made that flight and united pulled us off. We paid for those seats and standby got them.
111850,119203,MY FLIGHT TO LOS ANGELES LITERALLY SMELLS LIKE MINT AND IT HAS THE MINT SEATS @JetBlue IS THIS A COINCIDENCE
111856,119209,@united you can refund me for all the miu miu and Louboutins I'm going to buy since you lost my bag
111869,119223,"How can @united screw up so bad? Buy the upgrade with miles and $$$... ""Sorry. we made a mistake. those seats are now gone."" #neveragain"
111872,119226,Last time my bag was in Seattle it was lost for a week @AlaskaAir let's hope it doesn't get lost this time. #HaveToJokeAboutItNow

111901,119256,I hate @SouthwestAir Chicago Midway flight. That flight has been late going out every month since Southwest added new flights.  #TSALife
111912,119267,@SouthwestAir Is it possible to cancel one segment of a round trip? If so. how far in advance must cancellation be done?
111928,119283,@AmericanAir Hi. im still waiting for an answer...
111930,119285,@SouthwestAir that really sucked.
111934,119289,There's tv on @jetblue flights and I have so much homework to do so you can comfortably assume I'm going to try not to leave this plane
111947,119302,So flight back cancelled and @JetBlue is mucking up the works rebooking. #inefficient
111949,119304,Seriously @JetBlue?!?!? Runway Construction? Worst excuse to cancel a flight. Glad I paid a premium to fly on a Sunday to not go anywhere
111953,119308,Hi @JetBlue you just straight-up cancelled my flight back to jfk today with no explanation. I'm going to live tweet my experience to you.
111959,119315,@JetBlue why do u hate me
111963,119320,Big shout out to @JetBlue for canceling my flight and making me miss class tomorrow. Great stuff!!! So convenient!!!!!
111970,119327,I need a refund on my flight you cancelled today @JetBlue  not a rebook
111980,119339,BOTH my departing and returning flights were cancelled this week. ????? @JetBlue
111982,119341,Well that's awesome @JetBlue. cancel our flight just before we leave for the airport... not like there's work or school tomorrow. Terrific.
111985,119345,@JetBlue I need to schedule a new flight due to a delay and need to talk to a real person
111990,119350,"@SouthwestAir At login: ""Maximum number of tries reached. Please try again later."" How long to wait?!?"
111995,119356,Nothing like spending half of your Sunday waiting for @JetBlue to answer your phone call!!! So exciting!! 
111998,119359,@JetBlue after waiting 2 hrs rebooked to SRQ-LGA on TUES PM! Not looking for miracles but a credit. free drink or xtra legroom would be nice

112036,119399,@jetblue I've been on hold for more than 20 mins -- better to try to call later to speak to an agent or is this typical? Thank you.
112042,119406,Just found out the fuel pump on one of the engines was broken but 30 min later we're fixed and about to take off. #FeelingUneasy @united
112054,119418,@JetBlue - thanks for canceling all of the flights from Buffalo to NYC for construction at Kennedy. You guys suck at running an airline.
112062,119426,.@JetBlue I would love more options if customers are able to drive to nearby airports. Instead of the b&amp;w refund or wait three days.
112068,119432,@DeltaAssist flt 6427 from SFO stuck on LAX ground for 1 hr.  Will be tight conx w/1662 to RDU. Don't let it leave!!!

112073,119437,@united  I did. In addition. I provided you with the claim number in a previous Tweet. This is why I'm frustrated. Nobody is listening.

112160,119526,@AmericanAir I'd like to cancel my trip for the 20th of May. How many days in advance should I cancel it so I can be eligible for a refund?
112164,119530,@VirginAmerica every time I fly Dallas-New York my flight is delayed! Why Virgin?! This is the 4th x it's happened. http://t.co/1wz8QSB3Y1
112174,119541,No better way to end the trip without @united pilot missing the runway and going back up in the air where turbulence upset our stomachs. 
112176,119543,Response from @AmericanAir is that it is my fault for having wheels on the bag. Poor service?  I say so. http://t.co/F7byzorYQA
112184,119551,30 min on with @VirginAmerica reserved an isle seat now they're saying Too bad and there's nothing they can do even tho there's an open one

112195,119563,Thank you @AlaskaAir for officially making this the WORST BIRTHDAY of my life.
112200,119568,@JetBlue Did you really just move my flight from tomorrow to the next day (3/17)? Are you trying to ruin my vacation?  #jetbluesucks
112212,119580,@JetBlue could you tell me why flight tonight from JFK to DC is delayed
112219,119587,.@AmericanAir New 737s are awful. Take out the entertainment and give us back our legroom. Waste of space. http://t.co/nm0BloX39u

112244,119615,Long delay @VirginAmerica !!! #jfkairport #LAX
112246,119617,Question @SouthwestAir - what's your policy re: tired. crying children on a plane prior to takeoff? Do you ask the family to leave plane?
112255,119627,.@JetBlue thanks for picking my flight to be cancelled tomorrow guys. appreciate it. http://t.co/qpK2GfARl5
112257,119629,@AmericanAir Please stop shilling your credit card during flights. I feel bad for the flight attendant who has to read that tacky bullshit.
112265,119638,Really starting to second guess my choice with @JetBlue - another delay and this time no seat assignments yet #thestruggleisreal
112276,119650,@VirginAmerica  mad props to Orlando MCO ground crew for calm under pressure. nice work kicking it old school
112284,119659,Hi @DeltaAssist my DL435 has been just delayed for 4h. What could we work out?
112289,119665,Delayed at #pdx but @JetBlue is flying a plane in just for us so we can get home today. Thanks!
112290,119666,@JetBlue hi! I see flt 108 is delayed this pm. due to fly flt 2807 in am. Will it be an issue for the crew or is it a fresh crew?
112292,119668,@AlaskaAir Well #794 delayed out of Sea.  #791 delayed out of Alb.  Will miss #69 home today.  Thx's to call center booked on #65 tomorrow.
112293,119669,So after flying what I was told shortest @SouthwestAir route Austin-Houston. guessing plane issue reroute of Prov-Boston breaks that record?
112302,119679,@JetBlue one of the worst experiences trying to get back to NYC today &amp; it's not over yet - too many 'I'm sorrys' not enough correct info
112311,119689,@united you need a better policy for full flts and people who are too big to fit in seat. I was crushed against wall whole flight. Miserable
112314,119692,.@DeltaAssist when I was bumped I filed complaint and all that accomplished was an email and phone call saying sorry - waste of my time
112316,119694,Hey @JetBlue what's going on in NYC that all FLL flights are delayed??
112318,119696,@AlaskaAir getting no info about our delayed flight from PVR to SFO---&gt;SEA. :-( why is our plane in Mazatlan?
112319,119697,How bad are the winds in #PDX??? You know they R bad when @SouthwestAir  plane pulls up upon landing for our #safety. #flight4929
112321,119699,@DeltaAssist Delayed twice? Girls gotta go to work in the morning! Pizza would make me less tired. And maybe some socks.
112322,119700,@AmericanAir Hi. Just realized I'm gonna miss my flight LA to #SXSW today - head is foggy with a cold :(. What do you advise?
112323,119701,@JetBlue recall why I don't fly JB much. Plane load waits for repair of 1 mint seat!
112335,119714,@DeltaAssist I'm hoping you can help again! My BOS-CVG first leg took off late. afraid I'll miss CVG-PHX. Any other flights to PHX tonight??
112343,119723,let's talk about how i paid money to get on an earlier @JetBlue flight and now it is super delayed and a total waste of money :(
112344,119724,@JetBlue ruined our last pre-baby trip. Cancelled flight for no reason and 2+ hrs on phone. Next flight is Tuesday? Thanks for nothing.
112353,119734,Paid $150 for a Palm Springs flight and have to cancel it. @VirginAmerica is charging me $100 to cancel. #robbery - first virgin flight.
112355,119736,@AlaskaAir how long until you just cancel 2119 from Calgary so I can get a hotel voucher and not have to wait around for at least 5hrs?

112712,120113,For some reason my flight this morning got cancelled and I'm pretty sure the reason is passenger is too hungover thank u @JetBlue
112713,120114,The flight attendant on @JetBlue #JFK to #SJU is grace personified pre7am. It's like half the passengers have never boarded #plane before.
112722,120123,1st time flying @JetBlue . might be my last. Left PHX late with no reason explained and missed connect to RDU. _ so much for work today.

113301,120743,boarding group C...hopefully @SouthwestAir doesn't run out of overhead bin space.It's my own fault for waiting till 10am to check in.le sigh
113304,120747,@VirginAmerica the only reason i made a twitter was to tell you about my terrible experience on your airline.  #itsalldownhillfromhere
113308,120751,25.000ft and climbing on this crappy 70s @AmericanAir MD80 which is being thrown around like a bucket in some crazy thunderstorms #oldskool
113311,120754,@JetBlue is the diverted flight 807 the plane we need for our delayed 804 to Boston?
113313,120756,@JetBlue LOL thanks no problem.
113320,120763,@VirginAmerica you guys just can't help yourselves with sucking me further into loving your brand can you? #operationchihuahua #myheart
113323,120766,@united I really hope this UA 89 won't be delayed too much longer! Still hoping to make my connecting flight at Beijjng airport!
113329,120772,@VirginAmerica still waiting for you to start serving #NOLA!
113331,120775,When @AmericanAir erroneously charges you a booking fee. here's how they respond. 6 week wait for $25 http://t.co/QnVDorIa8N
113332,120776,Missed connection: flight attendant on @AmericanAir 1852 thought we knew each other but not sure how. Hope we can connect &amp; figure it out!
113334,120779,.@VirginAmerica You list 'total' fare prices. then. further down page. non-optionally require an Upgrade. Bad design. http://t.co/0Oat31MTDz
113336,120781,@JetBlue Flight 69 boarding delayed. Hopefully will board soon.
113337,120782,@united why do u not have a phone number for complaints? Worried too many pax will call? I have an issue. but no one to talk to! What to do?
113341,120786,@united.. Shocking my flight is late AGAIN. Only flew bc of my husband's work... Never again! #Unitedneedstocompensateguestsfornonstopprobs
113359,120805,@JetBlue any reason why flight 424 is delayed to JFK?
113360,120806,@united trying to book Flt 4536 (3/20) and Flt 4128 (3/23) on hold for 45 minutes. Any suggestions?
113361,120809,Hard to miss this digital billboard from @AmericanAir #NYC http://t.co/S8Poufv6LT
113367,120815,@JetBlue what's with the flight delays?? Everytime my mom and daughter are scheduled to fly back there's an issue
113371,120820,@AmericanAir hey guys. flight 202 to Boston here. Just a heads up that the TV in the seat is broke. http://t.co/DvPGP2yvFd
113372,120821,@southwestair from the air - internet crawls - both inbound/outbound trip. Paid twice. This after 1hr on tarmac going to #SXSW. What's up SW
113374,120823,You're not so bad after all @AmericanAir
113378,120827,Yes. Cannot wait for this @SouthwestAir 3 hour delay. No Florida on St. Patrick's day.
113380,120829,#ProTip when flying @united: spring for the Economy Plus row. Not too much more and legroom is SO worth it. especially on longer flights.
113386,120836,@JetBlue lots of problems on our flight today.  First bad experience with jet blue very disappointing
113387,120837,Flew with @JetBlue for #springbreak and incurred zero delay. Only #trustworthy #American carrier!
113400,120851,Apparenlty @united is coming out with a scent for the gate area- what do you think it will it smell like? http://t.co/MgAFoque4a
113409,120861,Can't wait for CA weather this weekend. @SouthwestAir
113411,120863,Never mind @DeltaAssist ... I took care of it myself.
113415,120867,@AlaskaAir called CS as security is bad aren't  &amp; super small wait area.  The response ; will tell Logan I will tell mgmt u called?
113416,120868,@AmericanAir having problems with check in for code shared flight from Austin to London Heathrow. I have AA Identifier but not BA one.
113421,120873,"Omgosh @DeltaAssist so much pressure to board ""correctly"" #rollerboard #wheelsin - my fault we'll be late to ATL?? #longday"
113437,120890,"@DeltaAssist you are the only ones delayed to nyc...the ""high winds"" are only affecting you for some reason? http://t.co/GcwlGz2sJm"
113439,120892,Hoping my luck continues @JetBlue - lost my prayer book on 3/13 flight 111 BOS/ORL-- would mean the world if found it. Seat 4C #hereshoping
113445,120899,Guess we won't be seeing each other after all tomorrow @JetBlue...flight already cancelled :(
113446,120900,@DeltaAssist going to miss connection in DTW for MSN. anyway I can go MCO to MSP instead and still get to MSN tonight?
113447,120901,I haven't always gotten along with @united. But I do like their waiting lounges. With stocked bar.
113451,120905,So @united plane is late in LA and I miss my flight.  They rebook me on a later flight in coach despite paying for first class. #notfair
113454,120908,That amazing moment @JetBlue moves my flight to a whole new day and  I have been on hold for 15 min...
113464,120918,@united UA3590 delayed? Am I dreaming? 7 cancellations and now my 9th significant delay this year. #flyerunfriendly
113470,120924,@DeltaAssist our some broke ass niggas fucking faggot stinky ass moutherfukers
113471,120925,@united just flew ORD to MSN on A319. Not even half full. First class still empty. Why fly A319 and 7 daily fls to MSN but no flights to TUS
113483,120937,Why am I not surprised @AmericanAir the return is starting off as bad as the first leg of the journey with you.  Ugh #lasttime
113484,120938,Two words for @united wifi. Why Bother? Two years later than competition &amp; barely works. Gogo not fast. but works and I pay one monthly fee.
113486,120940,@DeltaAssist hi please pm me i have an issue with a reservation
113490,120946,missed my connecting flight because of pure @AmericanAir stupidity
113492,120948,I'm missing out on whatever @SouthwestAir is doing to celebrate 30 years at Chicago #MDW today. http://t.co/hIE2V7OYe1
113498,120958,Waiting for @JetBlue 1007 to whisk down to sunshine and warmth. How's the weather back in Vancouver?
113502,120962,@VirginAmerica thx. For some reason the app can never locate my trips. Would love to use it but it just won't connect to my reservations.
113508,120968,@United Airlines practices bait and switch. I found a flight for $417 today on their site and when I went to purchase it became $1400 #Shady
113511,120971,@VirginAmerica Hi! I want to do the check-in online for a flight but I lost the Reference Number. What can I do? Can you help me? Thanks!
113512,120972,After 5 years I took a chance flying @united again &amp; like clockwork there's an issue within 24 hrs of booking my flight. #fail #notsurprised
113518,120979,I was so excited to watch tv on my @JetBlue flight today...... And the TV is broken. Day ruined.
113522,120984,. @AmericanAir you're killing me _ I just wanna go home I FINISHED ALL MY FINALS DAMMIT I DESERVE THIS
113523,120985,This poor bar tender at the JFK @JetBlue bar at gate 25 has been here since 5am... Give that man a raise please.
113526,120988,Ok @JetBlue WTF... It's one thing to offer late flights. but then to separate parties so they can't fly through the night together? Messedup
113538,121002,@AmericanAir our #honeymoon was ruined http://t.co/5vUubhm8z1
113543,121007,That time. 2 wks ago. when I lost my phone at ATL airport. That other time @SouthwestAir found it and mailed it back to me!!! Soo #thankful
113561,121025,My flight is cancelled __ I wanted to see my baby today __ @united
113566,121030,@united needs a course in managing expectations. Tonight they failed.
113570,121034,Oh @JetBlue do you ever leave on time?!
113593,121059,@JetBlue but they just told us it's the wind..? The tv/radio etc are out. Aaand we're even more delayed. 2yr old meltdown. #dissatisfied
113606,121072,@JetBlue what is the reasoning for Flight #122 out of West Palm Beach Florida being delayed?
113609,121075,Never been A1 before http://t.co/PDwaaMmtoe @southwestair #almosthome #sxsw
113610,121076,Seriously @AlaskaAir if I miss my next flight Cuz of this delay&amp; have to spend the night in Seattle I'm going to be so mad I want to go home
113614,121080,Extremely not happy with @JetBlue today.
113624,121090,@united flt 5247 lax to boi. medical issue. Any details?
113625,121091,"@AmericanAir: http://t.co/rHscwdJW6N This guy said ""it is not a AA problem"" and call a police Allan Myers #4760 SHA http://t.co/K73ACWMQFQ"
113627,121093,@jetBlue flight delay lounging. #bored #nikefree5.0 #NOLA https://t.co/UIE4zGS3UF
113630,121096,@united Why do the Japan bound planes from SFO always breakdown on me.  Hope it's not cancelled like last time!
113632,121098,So @AmericanAir dumping 5 flights on one carrousel at MIA. I am the 5th flight in line. 90 minute wait? More? http://t.co/VeOvy9U7CX
113633,121099,Shoutout to the @JetBlue workers at MSY right now! They're the silver lining to this delayed flight to JFK. Snacks on snacks on snacks.
113634,121100,@DeltaAssist supposedly a 9:50 out of Detroit now 10:20?  Come on......on the way out to Hartford via Detroit there was a 3 hour delay.  ??
113638,121105,"@jetblue delayed flt 576 MSY-JFK counts as an ""uncontrollable irregularity""? Snacks don't compensate cancelling important conference calls!"
113639,121106,@DeltaAssist trying to get off a plane in MSP. Connecting flight to PHX boards at 9:05. It's 9:10. still in the back. Don't leave. 
113647,121115,Oh. flew @SouthwestAir for our FL trip. Haven't flown them in years. I remember why now. Never again. #SouthWorst
113660,121128,Very important question: @DeltaAssist. how do I find out one of the songs that plays on your hold music? It's been stuck in my head all day!
113661,121129,Done with @AlaskaAir after today. After morning snootyness. a super late flight at end of day because of late crew. Awesome.
113662,121130,@AmericanAir can I claim compensation because of a missed connection?
113664,121132,The only thing worse than a difficult flight landing (expertly handled by @DeltaAssist) is a terrible cab ride. #welcomehome #nyc
113669,121137,@JetBlue Flight 324 on 3/17 - delay b/c of construction at JFK. but crew was great. best flight I've been on in years! #newfan
113677,121145,"Need a ""lift me up""? -- read all the complaint tweets that @united gets..."
113680,121148,What is going on @JetBlue? At JFK right now and my flight to Buffalo was delayed. My 12 year old  is exhausted but noticed cxld BUF flight.
113702,121172,@DeltaAssist Hi. I reached diamond status last December but I never got my cards...
113704,121174,Thx to @JetBlue I just lost 200$ on concert tix bc they had to have a 200$+ difference on flights to sjo on some dates versus the other _wtf
113710,121180,@united Hi there. United team never got back to me. and I'm unable to DM you because you're not following me anymore (I've followed you)
113717,121187,@AmericanAir  exactly! Full flight not possible change - confirmed on 14C &amp; was placed in 28C. Miserable flight!! http://t.co/WSZlaYljac
113721,121192,Such a terrible flying experience on @JetBlue. TVs reset; never turned off and lit up airplane like a g-d Apple Store http://t.co/8HFc9ZOdrt
113722,121193,@united Why no Premier access at EWR? It's insane. Your C2 security has 9 people in line. C1 has 100 with no Premier Access. So infuriating.
113728,121199,@AmericanAir it is a shame that Chicago to London was not a qualifying route!
113729,121201,@AmericanAir Waiting for a departure clearance in Shanghai! DFW bound http://t.co/vxmbTtHQUG
113730,121202,Waiting for an early morning flight to ORD at the DCA @united Club.  Not too bad a way to start the day... http://t.co/MJIyb7Chdt
113731,121203,@SouthwestAir be cheating. How i check in my flight exactly 24 hrs prior &amp; still B-8. I know that many werent up this early checking in
113771,121247,Praying and hoping that my suitcase is not too heavy for @SouthwestAir's standards  I can never not overpack.
113774,121251,@JetBlue as usual. I have the screwed up TV. http://t.co/hDo4SLQYui
113776,121253,You are now on standby for a possible barrage of angry tweets toward @united airlines. This could get ugly.
113778,121255,@SouthwestAir Probably a dumb question. Can I check into my flight today &amp; get my pass printed tomorrow? Travel buddy has a missing phone.
113787,121264,JFK is a mess. Only 1 runway open. We will taxi 2x longer than our flight time is today. cc @DeltaAssist
113788,121266,Wishing @VirginAmerica would have a sale for flights between Dallas and Vegas for late June/early July; would love to fly them!
113792,121270,I hope @united comes through for me. I'd be very disappointed if an airline I choose first for all my travel wouldn't make an exception.
113800,121278,.@JetBlue got cancelled in NYC rebooked w/a cross-town connection in DC_IAD&gt;DCA Wanna go halfsies on the shuttle?$20? http://t.co/GtsQmuynAL
113828,121311,@JetBlue I appreciate that and hope you look into the issues with flight 718
113830,121314,@AmericanAir I'm trying to purchase a reservation on hold but system can't find it. thought holds were guaranteed for 24hrs per DOT regs?
113836,121320,Having bad run w/@JetBlue this month (collecting many travel credits). but kudos to crew who landed plane in last night's Boston windstorm.
113839,121324,Sure wish America Airlines would get a plane to Louisville.  Killing our school trip to NYC. @AmericanAir
113842,121328,@DeltaAssist what is the number to call? I no longer have my ticket number.
113844,121330,@JetBlue  not so great to be traveling in MC with my toddler and siting on the runway for a hour past take off #nothappy
113845,121331,I Have A Missed Call From Delta Airlines @DeltaAssist And Haven't Been Able To Reach Anybody Since Last Friday...
113859,121346,I sent @United the info for that bait and switch flight and never heard back.
113862,121349,Look! Up in the sky! Is it a bird? A plane? No wait! It's my crushed hopes and dreams spiraling into oblivion... @AmericanAir
113864,121351,@JetBlue Delay info was not shared until well after scheduled boarding time. despite delay issue being known (runway access at JFK).
113865,121352,@AmericanAir I'll waiting for...
113879,121368,@AmericanAir WHAT??? WHY NOT??? My family. friends n I have been waiting too many yrs. We will continue to pray that u will 1 day soon!
113886,121375,Always an issue booking group flights. Thought @united  would have been easier to deal with than american. so far I'm wrong #costingafortune
113895,121384,@united Yes. if you could please give me a call directly to assist. this has been a huge waste of my time.  My number is 562-715-6827.
113896,121386,Yo. @AmericanAir don't let flight 2297 leave out of Dfw to Austin yet!! My connection flight is here But the gates occupied! Don't leave us
113901,121392,@AmericanAir I have been waiting for my refund for over 2 months...how much longer do i need to wait?? #worstcustomerservice
113908,121399,@JetBlue I'm on 885 (JFK-&gt;RDU) next Friday- just saw this mess. and was wondering if that'll mess up my flight? http://t.co/Zkbd3q3uQ5
113914,121406,Mad props to @AmericanAir for 1) compensating for my stupidity and rebooking my flight. and 2) their bomb ass new planes
113915,121407,"I can't wait!!! ""@AmericanAir: As we combine FF prog. Miles balances will be transferred to an AAdvantage account: http://t.co/lnqIp56Mwa"""
113923,121417,@JetBlue not a fan today. Very disappointed in decisions being made about flights from MCO to JFK.
113926,121420,Stuck on @AmericanAir waiting on a logbook?! Someone is letting them rip anonymously on this flight. Like deviled eggs and cumin.
113927,121421,We are at LAX waiting to board our @VirginAmerica flight to Las Vegas! So excited __
113930,121424,.@united how do you change the FF info on the existing reservation? Currently has UA# - I want to switch over to Miles &amp; More number.
113936,121430,@jetblue supposed to leave tonight for LAX from JFK. Flight says on time. How bad will delays be? Flight is at 9:30
113943,121437,@DeltaAssist ... If i were to miss this first flight from BRD to MNS. would Delta be unable to give me my other connection flight tickets?
113950,121444,@AlaskaAir no fast dash out of ANC? So sad :(
113959,121455,Bad enough #USAir crew stole my coat after my Euro trip. now they can't transfer a ticket to get me to a wedding. Done w/them. @AmericanAir
113962,121458,@VirginAmerica I'm stuck in SFO for the 4th hour. If only you'd reached out early I could've waited at home #bettercommunication
113963,121459,@AmericanAir yes but that didn't solve our issue of getting there when we needed to
113965,121461,Flights are so expensive! Trying to take my 1st vacation in forever &amp; never knew how flights have gone up. @JetBlue please have a sale! _
113983,121479,@SouthwestAir question: how difficult is it to change flight time on an already booked flight? just found out i can leave town a lot earlier
113985,121481,@alaskaair new #BOS #logan terminal has no #tsa precheck!  REALLY?!? #FAIL
113994,121490,@DeltaAssist Boarded and sitting on a plane at BWI with no pilots for more than 30 min. Stuck in traffic! folks missing connections FLT 1153
114004,121500,@VirginAmerica love flying w/you guys but sitting waiting for clearance from FAA leaving SFO while other JFK bound flights take off sucks...
114017,121513,@AlaskaAir apparently $125 gift certificate is what me losing 32 hours of family time is worth. Cancelled flight due to mechanical? Awesome.
114021,121517,@DeltaAssist Flying from Madrid on KLM then Delta from Amsterdam to Minneapolis - which airline do I check in with in MAD
114027,121523,@JetBlue Thanks so much for absolutely no warning about the JFK thing. Wasn't even told at check in that my flight is delayed at least 3 hrs
114028,121524,A mid-plane window seat with boarding position C-46. Never thought it would happen. But I still loath the @SouthwestAir  check-in process.
114031,121528,and whatever it is. i'm really sorry to the @united flyer i'm about to do a buy up on and get you kicked off the airplane for $1029.
114039,121537,@DeltaAssist no. to LGA __ I'm just trying to do hoodrat shit with my friends
114057,121556,Bad moves @AmericanAir http://t.co/oTdJvPI6Zb
114073,121572,.@AmericanAir flight from Chicago lands safely at Syracuse airport after reporting issue while in air http://t.co/IgwylUCX7m
114082,121581,Hopefully soon I will catch @AmericanAir 787! I keep on missing it!
114083,121582,@SouthwestAir I am trapped on the runway with no AC. Never flying south west again
114084,121583,@JetBlue 1371. And I am flying with a small child. This is getting ridiculous.
114086,121585,Thanks for the flight delay  #jetblue @JetBlue
114090,121590,Just wanted to say that @DeltaAssist just took care of my issue. Glad I followed up. They made it happen #thankyou
114092,121592,Thanks @AlaskaAir for ruining my plans to lay in a big comfy bed by 5! 
114096,121597,In the very front of a full @SouthwestAir flight. How I pulled off this placement I'll never know.
114100,121602,OMG!!! My new suitcase just arrived in the nick of time. Thank you @JetBlue  for being efficient about my claim and rectifying the issue 
114102,121604,.@AlaskaAir has great customer service. Fixed a minor issue &amp; gave me a discount code for my next trip b/c of the inconvenience! #iflyAlaska
114104,121606,Thanks @JetBlue for canceling our flight here and delaying the one back .... great traveling
114106,121608,Houston bound via @SouthwestAir... Cause I hate driving 
114107,121609,Stuck in Denver since 2pm on @SouthwestAir 634 due to a magical dent on the front of the plane. Wasn't there when I flew from Omaha...
114108,121611,@united My connection to Paris allowed only 5mins btwn flight from Austin via Houston. missed it. now via London. argh. Tmrow will be awful.
114110,121613,@SouthwestAir Worst air travel exp. of my life today. 10+ psgrs traveling from LGA-MSY via ATL booted from assigned plane and stranded.
114116,121620,@JetBlue Any reason for the delay right now on Flight B6 524 / LAX - JFK?
114118,121622,*Sigh* Checked in 22 hours before flight tomorrow. I really miss #AList on @SouthwestAir #BusinessTravel #CenterSeat http://t.co/yCma1YXCCe
114129,121633,@VirginAmerica FYI remote control broken at seat 8C on flight VX 0357.
114130,121634,First time flying @Americanair in years. and oddly enough first time being delayed for hours on end! #neveragain
114135,121639,@DeltaAssist  Still on hold!! http://t.co/pAtp2KSqUO
114136,121640,@JetBlue . what's up with the long phone wait times? It's not even snowing out...
114139,121643,@JetBlue I did reach out. Nothing at all. Another airline to book is over $500. This is a huge mess! 2nd consecutive trip with JB issues!
114146,121650,Hi @DeltaAssist. my plane had to make an emergency landing because the engine broke. oops.  Will we get credit for the miles we did fly?
114151,121655,Ok. @united not so bad after all.
114156,121660,@AmericanAir friends bos-jfk flight delayed. missed connc. Stuck til tomrw aft &amp; told bag is being held. Needa jacket in it. it's 33* out :/
114164,121668,Boarding in the @SouthwestAir C group brings back bad memories of being last to get the piece of cake at early age birthday parties
114167,121671,In Dallas on standby for a flight cus @AmericanAir fucked up. I feel like a side piece. This can't be life.
114179,121684,If I miss my connecting flight out of Boston at 11pm. someone's gonna have some explaining to do. @JetBlue
114189,121694,Seems silly that @AmericanAir doesn't let you switch flights to go to LGA instead of JFK.  I'd get home 3 hours earlier and much happier!
114196,121701,@JetBlue thanks JetBlue. I guess the passengers where the only ones that knew the planes was going to be late. I guess we need a pilot.
114201,121706,Hey @SouthwestAir - you subjected my 75 year old mother to an intoxicated seatmate on her FLL to LAS flight this am. No seats to switch to?
114206,121711,Hey @AmericanAir. Why is it always so stressful watching people boarding a plane around you.
114209,121714,"@united my last 4 flights with you 2 were delayed. 6 flights on delta none were delayed.  I want a divorce. you can keep my ""silver"" status."
114212,121717,My flight smelled like pretzels and teenager farts. but at least it was fast. @SouthwestAir
114215,121721,@southwestair whats the deal with the internet on your planes?  Is it always so slow ?
114227,121735,Hey. @united. I just just boarded UA5034 in Chicago and the plane smells very strongly of urine and feces. Thought you'd like to know :)
114237,121747,@AmericanAir is killing my vibe..
114242,121752,@JetBlue even though Flight 1049 to JFK was delayed 4 hrs and the WiFi didn't work. the flight crew was AMAZING. Best crew I've seen.
114253,121764,@united our plane from SF to Lihue had faulty landing gear so we flew in circles for 3 hours and were preped for a fireball crash landing.
114254,121765,@JetBlue what is going on with flight 428? Receiving conflicting accounts of the issue...so unacceptable. #jetblue #transparency #mco #ewr
114257,121768,@JetBlue I have the JB BLUES!  2 flts in a row cancelled yesterday at JFK Same http://t.co/zM7xDjvWbw JetBlue if you have 3 days to waste.

114271,121784,@united Yes. I have. Just curious what the general wait time to hear back is? Should I expect to wait days or weeks?
114276,121790,It took EVERYTHING in me not to watch #Empire on my @VirginAmerica flight b/c I'm waiting to watch it later w/ my boo #FirstClassChick
114280,121794,@united I just booked 3 tickets via Expedia 30 minutes ago but found out 2 of us can't go. Do I lose the fare if I cancel the 2 bookings?

114349,121867,@JetBlue you need to fix the tv's on your aircrafts . it is an inconvenience that we're in 2015 and i can't enjoy some tv during my flight
114352,121871,Wait in cold to use curbside @JetBlue check in only to find my package couldn't be checked there. Where's the signage and head up?
114357,121876,@DeltaAssist George at #grr is a rockstar turned a bad delay into a better situation for many travelers.
114366,121886,@DeltaAssist how about finding us a new connection to DTW now that we'll miss the DL1060 flight

114404,121927,@AmericanAir sucks!!!!! Third time flying in their crappy airplanes and every time there is a preventable issue. This time the toilets broke
114405,121928,@united changed my flight times to Vegas. Going to cause a big inconvenience for me and my friends waiting
114407,121930,@AmericanAir currently on flight 1411 and your plane smells like pure urine
114418,121941,@united Weather waiver issues for EWR yet due to incoming snow?
114420,121943,Express bag drop at @SouthwestAir is no longer express 
114422,121945,.@AlaskaAir - 2nd time (this time a cancellation) I've had issues w/ your airline leaving from Reno for Bay Area. It's becoming habitual. 
114427,121950,@JetBlue you're normally great. but your points for surveys are annoying. I click unsubscribe and it just takes me to the account page. :-(
114430,121953,Another late @AmericanAir flight late.missing my sister's graduation ceremony.Thanks again #AmericanAirlines #Miami http://t.co/1rSE8MzP0c
114437,121961,@JetBlue Thanks for the swift response! Is it ok if the tube is longer than the carry-on overhead bin requirements?
114439,121963,Starting my vacation off with a 1.5 hour delay. Thank you @VirginAmerica.
114440,121964,Not sure why @DeltaAssist cancelled my 6:30 am flight tomorrow morning out of DCA . We *might* get an inch of snow. #delta
114441,121965,Clear day at DCA and @united lets us board the plane before telling us we have a 30 minute delay to sit waiting to taxi.
114448,121973,Can't wait for my flight today with @AlaskaAir first time flier with them.... Going to Denver :) #GarthInDenver
114467,121994,@JetBlue's terminal at JFK is just fucking awesome  #travel #nyc #JetBlue #AIRPLANES

114496,122026,@AmericanAir hi aa.  Has weather advisory been issued for lga tomorrow?   Dont want to be stuck at the airport!
114505,122035,@DeltaAssist i'm supposed to leave from A33 at DTW shortly but there is no plane. Where is the plane coming from and when should it be here?
114508,122038,@JetBlue you said the wait time was 31 minutes. I'm clocking in at 53 right now. What gives?
114509,122039,Boarding a @JetBlue flight is always so quick makes being late a little more bearable. #nolabound
114511,122041,@AlaskaAir Each and every time you guys do it right. #SAN &gt; #HNL Never a bad flight with you...
114512,122042,@AlaskaAir thanks for closing the ticket counter early without making it clear that means I miss my flight
114513,122043,I miss so many people so much so can you have a sale please @SouthwestAir xoxo
114531,122062,@VirginAmerica Of course! Cannot wait for the next trip! #XOXO
114535,122066,Wow @JetBlue thanks for screwing us over...
114550,122081,"Checkd my email and opened ""sample weekly deals"" @AmericanAir : DFW to Longview (GGG) $220. #WASTE of #time #resources #payroll #justdrive"
114553,122084,@VirginAmerica Thank you for handling #custserv issues quickly and appropriately. Tough to reach right dept - but my issues resolved well.
114560,122091,Waiting to check in at Logan @JetBlue and looking at 10 unmanned check in desks and a line of about 100 people. Never again!
114561,122092,@DeltaAssist Your mobile app hasn't caught up to Daylight Savings!  Are my flight notifications all going to be late?
114563,122094,@SouthwestAir FPQLEL is my confirmation number. I don't mind a delay but sat here from 1-3 without any updates or personnel
114570,122102,@united didn't catch her name but the flight number was 6487.  She must have been having a bad morning. but still...
114576,122108,@JetBlue left me stranded in NYC for 2 days. No apologies no vouchers no nothing. Cancel my flight for nonweather reasons and said #screwyou

114586,122119,@DeltaAssist can I email you about an issue? The only option I see is to call you.
114587,122120,#FSIntroPR @AlaskaAir passing out water &amp; chocolate to people whose flights were delayed = avoiding negative tweets!
114592,122125,Thank goodness for @VirginAmerica's satellite TV &amp; apologies to fellow passengers for my scream ending the Ga St/Baylor game. #MarchMadness
114608,122143,I miss the days when @JetBlue acted like a startup &amp; didn't charge big change fees 
114610,122145,my @united seat is so cramped there's about a micron of clearance for my knees if seat ahead reclines. Wish they'd disable that feature.
114617,122153,@united Hi folks. flight for tomorrow a.m. was just cancelled. website won't let me rebook. phone wait time is 25 mns. less-than-happy face.
114624,122161,When do flights open to book for late December? @JetBlue
114631,122170,.@AmericanAir run a/c on your planes at the gate or don't load it. Miserable in a tin can with NO air circulating.  #DFWtoBNA
114634,122174,Nice job @JetBlue - free movies on flight #619 because of a birthday on the plane! A+ customer service &amp; personality without being annoying
114637,122177,@AlaskaAir My pleasure. Missed connex due to delay. As soon as I landed. app notified me I__d been rebooked. Lousy situation. great service.
114639,122179,@united do you think you'll cancel flights from New York tomorrow?
114650,122191,@DeltaAssist on DL6437. but concerned I would miss it. Did same day confirm on next - 6437 is 20 mins late. Forfeited upgrade and extras!
114656,122197,"Forgot just how CRAMPED @AmericanAir flights are.  Even after paying extra for ""preferred"" seating. What a scam."
114657,122198,Thanks @JetBlue for losing my husband's luggage and doing NOTHING to make us confident we will see it again. Vacation ruined
114658,122199,@DeltaAssist ok Delta disappointing again... Broken down on the runway at White Plains. waiting for a tow for heavens sakes.
114667,122208,@AmericanAir - This should be illegal. #stinkyfeet #smellynetting #needsapedi http://t.co/l4mxcN9uXF
114670,122211,Just realized that when my wallet was stolen I not only lost credit cards and ID. but also all of my @SouthwestAir drink coupons. #newlow
114680,122221,@united looks like I might miss my flight to San Fran because of mechanical issue. Can you make sure I'm on the next available? Ft ua 741
114693,122234,After my huge debacle with @JetBlue the flight and flight crew stunk. What a waste of money. I'll be writing a letter!
114695,122236,What? @DeltaAssist says 2+ hr wait time on hold?
114696,122237,@DeltaAssist This is my third flight in a row that's been cancelled.  Oh and every time I call you. there is over an hour wait. 2+ today.
114699,122240,@DeltaAssist 3 flights from Chicago to New York tmrw morning cancelled one after the other. Ya killing me mayne
114704,122245,@SouthwestAir 570 flight from Houston to Kansas City #Delayed gate agent says the plane has been broken all day. New plane needed.
114707,122248,Gee @united. sure was groovy of you to cancel my flight &amp; rebook me w/o even asking. But no. getting in an entire day later will not work.
114708,122249,I complain a lot so I have to give @AmericanAir credit for honoring all purchased mistake fares. Holds issue is another matter though.
114718,122259,@AmericanAir I take issue w/ur wait list policy Gold gets bumped even if Gold has been wait listed on last 3 Flights #notgood
114719,122260,"@AmericanAir what about those of us from DCA-PEK that did your ""GUARANTEED"" 24 hour hold?? Should we wait for DOT? http://t.co/E4kv83wl3X"
114726,122267,Oops @jetblue paid $100 for 7lbs over and now no TV! This birdie is not happy.
114727,122268,After being on hold for 58 MINUTES. Delta hung up on us as we tried to juggle dates. Dreadful. And nothing was resolved. @DeltaAssist
114730,122271,I love flying with @VirginAmerica but man their investment in new technology is really. really poor. http://t.co/oVNT0UshfS
114732,122273,Can't wait to fly out to Vegas. flying with @VirginAmerica hope the flights as nice as it looks on the site wifi and USB charger ports :D
114734,122275,@VirginAmerica so disappointed.  Flight to #vegas 4 #marchmadness got cancelled with a measly $50 credit after pulling teeth.
114741,122283,@united if UA4689 gets cancelled tomorrow what's your guys' plan for me?
114743,122285,On the way now via @AmericanAir to Vegas. I hear we've had a few upset while in the air.
114744,122287,@SouthwestAir I purchased early bird check in for the first time &amp; it was a waste. Checking in 24 hours sharp has always been better.
114745,122288,@DeltaAssist - Aaaah. My car broke down and I am going to miss my 4:25 flight. can you get me on the 745 Spokane -&gt; Seattle
114746,122289,sucks that I have insurance and @jetblue won't let me change my flight even tho my cruise was cancelled  so much for loyalty.
114761,122305,@JetBlue i love you guys. but was sad to find my tv didn't work on my flight home yesterday fm ATX to BOS : ( http://t.co/zTGdrfT5px
114767,122312,"@AmericanAir Just had your cobb salad midair &amp; the ""bacon"" tastes awful... what I imagine those bacon dog treats taste like. Yuck."
114769,122314,@DeltaAssist Should I check in online early then or wait until tomorrow?
114771,122316,@DeltaAssist missed connection from your delay. now have to wait 17 hrs for the next flight. and the best that you can do is $100 voucher??
114774,122320,@DeltaAssist: how about a msg telling how long customers should expect to wait on the phone. like every other airline?
114783,122329,@DeltaAssist what's the issue with weather in nyc? rebooked on new flight but have a layover. is this best case scenario?
114788,122334,Oops. My bad. @united with the broken printer. Call the mechanic!
114794,122340,Heading home! Missed my babies. @SouthwestAir MDW-&gt;SAN 
114795,122341,@united I need help asap. You cancelled my mothers flight in Palm Spring. CA to Tulsa. Ok She is calling me crying. I need help now
114797,122343,@SouthwestAir you tell me my flight changed &amp; to call you if the new time doesn't workout. I call y'all but you leave me on hold for 20min
114800,122346,Hey @JetBlue thanks for the destroyed bag that I have to replace thanks to your workers http://t.co/Jp6uSOE8UG

115223,122786,@VirginAmerica trying to buy a ticket but nothing when I finally hit 'purchase tickets'. Is there a problem with your website?
115225,122788,@VirginAmerica not a bad airline to travel with at all! I was impressed with the amenities &amp; the wicked safety rap video!
115229,122793,@JetBlue thanks for late night notice of flight cancel. 55 min hold time &amp; re-book at diff airport (DCA v IAD) and last row seat assign
115236,122800,@AmericanAir app abandoning iPhone 4 users. Bad idea!
115245,122810,well no flight to SFO tonight thnx to the stupid snow!! hopefully my @VirginAmerica flight tom. morning will be on time. fingers crossed!!
115252,122817,The Best and Worst Airlines for Customer Experience http://t.co/ERNzDGU4gX #1 @JetBlue  Congrats! http://t.co/yNc1frLaFU

115259,122824,@VirginAmerica Hey. my flight was cancelled. and now they tell me there's no flights available that will get me to my cruise tomorrow!
115260,122825,Thanks @JetBlue! Nothing like a delayed flight 
115262,122827,I hate @SouthwestAir :-)
115266,122831,@jetblue you guys think you are soooo cool. delaying your flights. Well I have news for you. I'm in the airport. Generating CONTENT. Ha!
115269,122834,@DeltaAssist -Gigi. lead  attendant on DL1341was the one bright spot on an otherwise long and unpleasant travel day. Give her some kudos 
115270,122836,@AmericanAir will you guys status match me if i switch from united ? so sick of their abysmal customer service
115274,122840,Help @VirginAmerica my flight was canceled to NYC and I need to be there by tonight! There is a 50 minute wait period.
115277,122843,@VirginAmerica Flight from SFO-EWR was cancelled with no notice and no other flights landing in EWR tonight! Need help ASAP Phone wait 45min
115282,122848,I don't like this @SouthwestAir line up for a long time in order to wait get your number called and pick a seat thing.
115285,122851,@SouthwestAir its snowing in New York but not badly. is there i chance i'll get there in the morning safely
115290,122856,@Jetblue Trip to the DR coming soon. Can't wait. #DestinationFriday
115304,122871,@DeltaAssist what happened to priority boarding for flight 5724 today? Awful when delta doesn't actually give perks they say they have
115307,122874,@DeltaAssist Possible to switch from 1646 to 672 tomorrow? My conf HBAZAS; with wife. Tx.
115310,122877,@VirginAmerica your policies suck for check in. As a card holder. I can't wait to burn my card. So over you.
115317,122884,@SouthwestAir GIVE US SOME DEALS. I'LL LEAVE.
115318,122885,De-icing at BWI @SouthwestAir even though we are late. Safety first and I'm glad. Can't wait to see my girl at Kenyon tonight. 
115319,122886,@SouthwestAir please don't cancel my flight!
115325,122893,@JetBlue  if our flight to JFK keeps getting delayed _ can we rebook to tomorrow without a fee?
115328,122896,@DeltaAssist - issues at MSP? Flt DL4008 parked on far side of field. Connections in jeopardy?
115332,122900,Despite #616 delay to NYC. love @JetBlue being upfront &amp; honest w/ 2.5 hr delay. landing after weather advisory time. More time in CA sun!
115338,122906,@SouthwestAir unlucky for us we are watching how your SW folks are manhandling our stroller. No respect for others belongs. Flight 1269 #sad
115345,122913,2 out of 3 ain't bad. RT @AmericanAir: Sand. sun and savings: http://t.co/SRM4daDWtZ http://t.co/FBYicXIfoe
115347,122915,@JetBlue got my Angry Orchard . my free FlyFi. and watching #MarchMadness great way to fly
115354,122922,@AmericanAir can't wait to get there the next august! Only flying the double A!
115375,122944,You've got to be kidding me! Still upset about my A-list debacle @SouthwestAir http://t.co/BmMcdrJiIH
115378,122947,@AmericanAir it was too late by then. it was inconvenient that no notification was sent out
115379,122949,@AmericanAir I thought I was a bad speller... http://t.co/wx2JuOgA84
115386,122956,@VirginAmerica hi thanks for ruining my travel by canceling my flight. Now i have to wait for 6 hours for a new flight not even
115389,122959,@united I've picked up my missing guitar. However. it doesn't improve my situation since I needed it YESTERDAY.
115393,122963,@united finally on our way because we got to switch airlines. #ThankGod.  #UnitedSucks
115400,122970,@united has lost its mind with new requirements for premier status. Flying star alliance means nothing I guess. Been with them forever too
115401,122972,@united - What's going on into EWR? Waiting on Tarmac in PHX for 30 + minutes!?! #airtrafficcontrol
115403,122974,@AlaskaAir    I will tell everyone I know about this poor service &amp; post in every review.  So much for mvp.  I used to think u were the best
115411,122982,"@VirginAmerica I would love to get a refund on my cancelled flight to EWR online. But the ""cancel itinerary"" button is not available."
115418,122989,@SouthwestAir cant print my boarding pass- might miss plane!
115426,122997,@DeltaAssist you need to hire more call center people. every time i call i have to wait for everrrrrrrr
115429,123001,Running  late. May missed the check in Cut off. Hopefully. we have exception? @americanair
115432,123004,Anytime I fly and can't fly @VirginAmerica I actually get sad.  Just the Virgin colors make me happy.  #Virgin4Life #VirginProud
115441,123013,@DeltaAssist. a plane full of sad Midwesterners on DL734 would like to make our connections. Maybe hold some planes in MSP? Esp 4653 to ICT?
115453,123025,Wait time to book a flight with @SouthwestAir on the phone? &lt;5 min. Wait time to cancel a flight? Over 70. Something's fishy here.
115456,123029,Wish @united would do a better job communicating with passengers when they know a flight is going to be delayed. UA5028 IAD-DTW
115458,123031,I'm losing the will to live being on hold to @AlaskaAir
115467,123041,Can't go on vacation April 6th because every @AlaskaAir flight anywhere is insanely expensive. $1.200 for 2 to Vegas is ridiculous.
115470,123044,@DeltaAssist just checked in for dl472 for tomorrow. It's saying the flight is delayed but no other info. Whats the deal?
115479,123054,My flight to JFK/NYC is delayed here at LAX. but Jane the @JetBlue lady is being so nice that I don't even mind waiting.
115480,123055,@JetBlue I do indeed...  I would never not fly the official airline of the jets... ever! http://t.co/K1ncUxOoVo
115483,123058,@VirginAmerica if only you had issued a weather waiver for Boston today. I wouldn't be in this mess.
115489,123064,@SouthwestAir usually you have the best employees anywhere. You need some work in Orlando. Rudeness.
115495,123070,So mad. I have been to 3 countries in less than a year &amp; just realized I am not signed up for frequent flyer miles with @AmericanAir
115500,123075,Only a lil delay we've got this @AmericanAir #homebound http://t.co/y1lo0Q9gWV
115502,123077,We're on our way guys! Wait for us @united #1148
115509,123084,@DeltaAssist DL 6284 STL to LGA delayed.  can you back me on DL 6288 tomorrow am in case of cancellation?  don't want to switch only back up
115528,123104,Let's cancel earlier flights when the weather is GREAT. wait til the weather gets worse. then delay your flight in the evening @JetBlue #MAD
115537,123114,@JetBlue said I'd only be on hold for 9 minutes it's been 15.  take my call pls. Also your hold music is sub par at best
115547,123125,@AmericanAir MAD MAD MAD #horrible
115548,123126,And @AlaskaAir at it again with the delay... I have never had a flight be on time with them.
115551,123129,@united wins for always being delayed.
115555,123133,@united lost my keys on my flight. 618 today into O'Hare. I filled out the form but is there anything else I can do?
115560,123138,THANK YOU to the @JetBlue agent for helping me get a credit even though my flight wasn't cancelled. You're fantastic.
115562,123140,@AmericanAir please refund my advantage points w/o fee. Had to cancel upcoming trip because taking in emergency foster child.
115582,123161,@AlaskaAir another bad experience with Alaska Air.  2 big ones in  6 days.
115599,123179,Never flying another airline again. @VirginAmerica is where it's at. Feel like I'm on the real life soul plane. http://t.co/TXgTFx5tMK
115611,123193,Hanging with this guy in eternal purgatory (RSW) waiting for a @united flight to EYW that's also in purgatory (MCO). http://t.co/SIVtsVuYEm
115632,123214,Sunday flight 578 from PDX via @AlaskaAir was a nightmare and NOT from the wind delays. The lies and the bus were horrid w/ no care from AA!
115641,123224,@JetBlue Had terrible service from you're air hostesses today. Not a happy customer who is a regular tourist with your airline
115646,123229,@united hi a package broke of mine from a flight. Is there a claim report I can fill out?
115653,123237,You just lost my business for life. @VirginAmerica.
115691,123276,So disappointed in @SouthwestAir! They lost my car seat bag on our trip from LAX-&gt; Sac that had our_ https://t.co/0s8Dr65j6a
115692,123277,The @virginamerica pilot spoiled us with this mad view of the Las Vegas strip on our flight to SF. wow. _ http://t.co/QyMqcvwcID
115696,123281,Just had a great round trip experience with jet blue. Never flying another airline again. Thd for the extra legroom and tvs! @JetBlue
115697,123282,@DeltaAssist Im on a plane that cant take off because it smells like poop. This is a new low. 
115709,123294,@VirginAmerica thanks of smooth ride from LAX to JFK.. To bad we had to wait 20 minutes to find a place to get out! #sucks!
115712,123297,@SouthwestAir flight #667 to SLC sooooooo late leaving Las Vegas. Sooooooo late!!!!
115723,123311,@united you are killing me.
115731,123319,@DeltaAssist My skymiles account is missing over 12.000 miles from yesterday to today... I never made any redemptions.
115732,123320,@AlaskaAir thank you! Amazing service and you quickly took card of my issue! Kudos!
115737,123325,@SouthwestAir why is your Twitter feed nothing but apologies for incident of bad service? Why not status updates and sales? It Gets old.
115745,123333,@SouthwestAir Which gate at MDW is best for camping out in? Looks like I'm going to be stuck here until Monday or Tuesday.
115750,123338,@united My flights been delayed due to a late inbound crew. The terminal next to mine was overbooked. I'm not impressed with your airline.
115765,123353,"@DeltaAssist I accidentally clicked on ""Cancel itinerary only (?)"" when trying to click on the (?) part. did I just cancel my trip? :("
115767,123355,@AmericanAir Been getting this error all day while trying to sign up for AAdvantage. What's going on? Bad IT? http://t.co/VnGXJPnGlr
115768,123356,@AlaskaAir thanks for the awesome flight on Tuesday! can't wait for the flight back home to Vegas :))
115777,123365,You will not ruin this weekend @SouthwestAir !! You will not! http://t.co/R7RoziUFdG
115781,123369,@SouthwestAir how late is your baggage claim office open in PHX?
115782,123370,@SouthwestAir how late is the baggage claim office open at phx tonight?
115784,123372,"@AmericanAir why can't I book my flight on your website. It shows fares. but it says ""sorry fare no longer avail"" for everything i select!"
115786,123374,The level of disdain I have for @SouthwestAir far surpasses what I have for any other company in the US. The inconvenience of today is crazy
115789,123377,@VirginAmerica NEVER again. We missed Cabaret because of YOU!!!
115815,123403,@united asking for upgrade and the check-in/ticket agent lies in my face! Bad if upgrade is shown online. Any deal? #ServiceFail
115825,123414,@DeltaAssist I just can't log in. It can wait till morning.
115826,123415,@AmericanAir hey is AA101 still scheduled and ok to fly to NYC this morning after yesterdays bad weather?? Fingers crossed
115828,123417,45% on time performance on the @AmericanAir flight I've been delayed on for nearly an hour. Should have saw that coming #sigh
115837,123427,So another bad experience with @united plane had a leaky AC on the way back . #TheStruggleIsReal http://t.co/VSoBagvfJn
115839,123429,Here we come  @AmericanAir  I can't wait !!!!
115852,123442,Hey @JetBlue Your boy Ryan at the Buffalo check-in desk is awesome! He switched our flights to avoid delays so we wouldn't miss our cruise.
115854,123444,Hey @SouthwestAir. you cancel my flight then make me wait 17minutes and going at 4AM? http://t.co/t6gzjGo4BW

115875,123467,@southwestair Get me outta this snow hell and into some warmer weather. #ain'tSNOWbodygottimefodis https://t.co/IjFjxrY7MY
115892,123485,@AmericanAir no problem re safety but find it somewhat bizarre that you would only know 30min pre takeoff that a plane is not travel-worthy
115895,123488,@SouthwestAir you stranded my daughter and her friends in Orlando.  No flights til Monday.  So 3 15 yr olds stuck w/o money #southwestfail
115897,123490,How I've missed having a reason to play with the 'fun stuff' section of the mobile app @JetBlue http://t.co/U8ezT6MpBz

115930,123523,@AmericanAir your services are ruining my vacation.

116005,123677,I love overhearing @VirginAmerica virgins walk down the aisle in amazement. You never forget your first time. kids.
116007,123679,@SouthwestAir Wait. you guys aren't Butler fans? We might need to rethink this relationship. #MarchMadness #godawgs http://t.co/yTHWr6bTGI
116008,123680,All checked in with @SouthwestAir . off to Austin tomorrow. #BusinessTrip #NoGolf #Sad
116017,123691,@SouthwestAir paid for priority seating. but given position C 48. Need to get what I paid for. Can't wait until customer serv opens on Mon.
116024,123699,@VirginAmerica bad url. Goes to a spam page
116025,123700,@VirginAmerica this link is broken...
116031,123706,@SouthwestAir why are there never any sales/deals from ROC? It's a pain to drive to BUF just to get a decent price to fly to Florida!
116035,123710,3 hours of delay and a lost bag is not the best way to end a vacation @SouthwestAir
116038,123716,@AlaskaAir on your airline you need 25k miles for the same flight?? How is your mileage plan at all valuable to loyal customers? frustrated
116040,123718,I was mad at @united and then I felt appeased. and now Im mad again. Ugh.
116043,123721,@AmericanAir Why do you even have online check in? It never works. http://t.co/MN6PmaxbH0
116078,123759,@JetBlue Kind of ridiculous that TrueBlue requires email address for membership of a six/ten yr old #WhyCantIJustUseMyEmail
116083,123764,@united i missed flight UA5106 rep Janice Holister can't help asking me to wait at age till 7pm to get standby. Wait for next 5 hours?
116086,123767,I'm going to invite everyone from @AmericanAir over for dinner. seat them. then cancel the meal.
116092,123773,@AmericanAir hi still awaiting compensation keep emailing customer relations but no reply - shocking it looks like I need a solicitor!
116098,123779,@AmericanAir   figured out why 2052 didn't wait - was proactively re-booked for a.m. flight before 1740 even landed.  #nexttimewaitplease
116119,123803,Poor experience with @AlaskaAir with a 5hr delay and no time to when we are going to leave. Let's go already! #alaskaair
116127,123811,Flying @americanair is never worth the money I save. Still on the tarmac 45 minutes later.
116131,123815,@americanair I'm on US FLT1721 gonna miss my connection. can u assist? My name is Nora Leisk &amp; my travel companion is Philip Tabak
116140,123824,Thank you @AlaskaAir! I just had the best flight experience with you. Can't wait to fly with you again.
116142,123826,Is it possible change flight reservation time to the late one ?@SouthwestAir
116143,123827,@AlaskaAir 5hr delay on Alaska air to Honolulu. Mechanical errors and captain walks off for federal rules-really!
116144,123828,@JetBlue thanks for a no reason delay on flight 1161. Cost me $75 for a car service upon landing since my grandfather can't drive that late
116145,123829,"Been waiting over 2 hours to board our flight to San Diego bc of ""software updates""? What the heck @SouthwestAir ?!"
116147,123831,@JetBlue refused to give seat assignment at booking &amp; at online check-in. Must wait in line at airport. High baggage fees. Never again.
116148,123832,Happy to have a flight delay leaving Florida! And happy that @JetBlue is letting me know early so I can stay in the pool a little longer!
116157,123842,@AmericanAir You guys owe an apology and more everyone that tried to leave Baton Rouge to Dallas yesterday evening.  What a disaster.
116158,123843,starving. hope I get to LAX early enough to grab a bite before heading home @SouthwestAir
116159,123844,I have a bad feeling about this @JetBlue flight I'm on. The male flight attendant has a pony tail.  #SayNoToMalePonyTails

116239,123928,@DeltaAssist our flight has been delayed from 7:05 to 11:50 PM. that means we're losing half a day of our vacation. Can you help us somehow?
116250,123939,@united We'll miss connection - paid $1.300 extra for a staffer to come. now we all will get stuck in Houston. I'm DONE with United!
116272,123964,Flight delayed 3 and a half hours. Love @AlaskaAir 
116286,123978,@JetBlue How can u justify a 6 hr flight delay for no reason? Never flying JetBlue again! Made me join Twitter just to start JB bashing!

116325,124019,Your 1010pm flight to London is delayed due to awaiting aircraft. UA4 now departs Houston 1051pm @united you rock http://t.co/VHUHkSG8ll

116368,124063,@DeltaAssist Bag damaged on flight 1775 to SFO. Did not have time to talk to rep at SFO. but have pictures. Next steps?
116369,124064,@SouthwestAir Luv that my flight got into Seattle 20min early. Offset by waiting to see our bags for 40min. Kinda sucks.
116370,124065,My @SouthwestAir experience today has hit an all time low. Delayed 3hrs due to a mechanical issue. board everyone. Then same issue again.
116380,124075,@SouthwestAir If last letter of a last name is missing on reservation how big of a deal is it flying domestically? Can you add that letter?
116389,124084,@AmericanAir but wait my tweet was about us being forced to leave classmates behind abroad...
116392,124087,I love you @JetBlue !! I'll never fly with anybody else _ time for vacation!!
116393,124088,Really do not need the stress of worrying if I can actually catch the flight I__m supposed to with @AmericanAir.

116418,124114,@DeltaAssist it was awful. I have two trips in May. If Delta airfare is the absolute cheapest. I'd consider. Otherwise.... No.
116421,124117,@JetBlue your security line is abominable
116428,124124,@united You were my preferred airline for 30+ years. but your medallion quals changed. Sad it won't make sense to fly my 70k+ miles anymore.
116430,124127,Hey @JetBlue bring my girlfriend home quick from jfk today. I miss her!!!
116432,124129,@DeltaAssist my connection DL1588 running like 30% late.. Am I missing DL1154 connection or will be held for connecting passengers?
116441,124138,It seems that @JetBlue won't let me check-in online anymore. So annoying! #annoyed
116445,124142,Not too bad of a morning view @AmericanAir ... Looking for a smooth flight to #DC . http://t.co/KX5ZPq5KRI
116449,124147,@SouthwestAir 2 days. 5 calls. 3 emails. 4 tweets. 350 min on hold. Starting to think I could walk faster than I could fly with you. #giveup
116459,124157,Shout out to @JetBlue for always taking care of me on my flights home and back to school! And for hauling on this delay #KeepCalmAndBlueOn

116470,124169,@AmericanAir 36 pages of hundreds of complaints and no action yet http://t.co/YVWpLNLYGN
116478,124178,It only takes two bad experiences with @SouthwestAir to make me switch which airlines I use....so angered
116480,124180,@AlaskaAir it's annoying that there are seats in first class available. but because I booked my ticket w/ miles. I can't get an MVP upgrade
116486,124186,@SouthwestAir why is flight 2413 from San Diego to Atlanta delayed? Big inconvenience I have another flight to prepare for? Weather?
116493,124193,I really need to write a article about how much I miss flying @AlaskaAir and why you should always fly with them when you can! #akair
116494,124194,I forgot to check in for my @SouthwestAir flight and now I'm in boarding group C tmrw. Ugh.
116497,124197,Hi @AmericanAir. could you help me to check the last status of lost lugage TPZFQP. Im in Indonesia n hv a prob to call.

116574,124281,Whoever decided @AmericanAir should serve EGG SALAD to people trapped on planes should be fired. ...Wait. Is this a practical joke?!
116576,124283,@JetBlue miserable experience coming back throu FLL customs from SJO. You need to work with FLL on pass experience. inadequate capacity

116608,124318,Now they cancel our flight. why @SouthwestAir
116614,124324,@SouthwestAir on flight 1170 to chicago. Delayed.  Your pilots need to do a better job communicating the problem of the long delay.
116622,124333,If @JetBlue is showing #ElClasico I will never fly another airline again #HalaMadrid
116634,124345,@DeltaAssist having a tough time applying my travel voucher. very disappointed in delta at the moment
116639,124351,Can't wait for our trip on @AmericanAir to London!  #Honeymoon
116645,124357,@AmericanAir no wifi? Im trying to watch el clasico. Dumn fucks!!
116653,124366,@JetBlue I am not impressed. Ur personnel are lovely. but charging me to change to an earlier flight when mine is delayed is just tacky.
116655,124368,@SouthwestAir no but can I cancel flights?
116656,124369,So far. hit and miss traveling on @AmericanAir. Had to show them twice my video bag meets carry-on size. Sry. I won't check $20k in gear.
116671,124386,Oh good. After the 4 hour wait. I've been informed that the flight is overbooked and I've been bumped. Thanks. @AlaskaAir!
116673,124388,Stuck at NY-jfk airport with @JetBlue   Their maintenance caused us to miss our connection and now all flights to buffalo are full... #Stuck
116675,124390,@AmericanAir any deals to Barbados in late July?
116683,124398,@DeltaAssist not sure if anything can be done.  Might have to cancel and change airlines.
116688,124403,@AmericanAir I hate you
116703,124418,@JetBlue a call or text of delayed flight 1202 to JFK would have been appreciated.
116705,124420,@AlaskaAir Yeah. unusual trip -- never had a problem before. The mileage would be fine. Hopefully my upcoming trip will go smoother.
116708,124424,@SouthwestAir our 14 year-old son will miss a test. I will miss teaching and will be unpaid. There are 3 of us.  This is hateful.
116714,124430,@DeltaAssist Travelling CHS-ATL tomorrow. wondering if it's possible to switch to an earlier flight? Getting connecting intl flight from ATL
116718,124434,The @SouthwestAir terminal at LAX is terrible. I thought Laguardia was bad.
116719,124435,@DeltaAssist - another flight. another week. another #ghetto plane. My fave airline. but repairs need to be fixed. http://t.co/YM9bXjo5nz
116721,124437,@JetBlue woo! Should I cancel my check in and then re check in to see if pre check shows up?

116731,124447,@AlaskaAir No no. I'm fine. Just made a horrible joke about your airline name then knocked myself out for doing it. Thanks!
116734,124450,@AlaskaAir if I miss my flight because im stuck in Seattles ridiculously long security line what happens?
116736,124452,On way 2 UK. crew delay caused missed connection &amp; overnight stay. Now no crew 2 tow back 4 broken steering at o'hare. Not okay. @united.

116753,124472,@DeltaAssist agent at jfk says sorry we are short staffed and that's my problem why?
116755,124474,The Pilate is late. the plane was too full for me to even bring my jacket. and it smells like pig poop @DeltaAssist please reevaluate
116761,124480,Every time I have to fly anything but @SouthwestAir I feel like I'm cheating. #missyouSouthwest #andyourfreecheckedbagstoo
116762,124481,@SouthwestAir I laud you all the time but today my flight was cancelled! #SOS

116772,124494,Once again @United kicks me in the dick by getting to the airport and making me wait on a gate. Too bad nobody invented radios.
116778,124500,One Jet Blue flight delayed from JFK. Mine. Home by 2am maybe. Thanks a lot. #1201. @JetBlue #useless #waitingfortheexcuse

116831,124557,@SouthwestAir - we can't find out vouchers from our trip by waiting for another flight back in September!!!  ___
116842,124568,@united broke one of the wheels on my carry on. No clue how they did that. :(
116845,124571,@JetBlue Never seen such a disrespectful flight attendant.  Your error kept us on runway for 45 mins she locked bathroom on all guests.
116857,124584,@united You will be getting an email from lots of very angry people who were apart of my group

116882,124609,So @SouthwestAir just cancelled my flight without any explanation! Then I'm attempting to call to find out some answers &amp; its a 100 min wait
116887,124614,@AmericanAir Just landed DCA on flight 3917 from GSO. Any chance 4536 to PVD will wait for me? RL:GPSD1G

116892,124620,Hey @AlaskaAir next time you switch my seat without asking me first. please don't change me from a window to an aisle.  #nothappy
116900,124629,Hi @SouthwestAir why cancel a flight and not allow people to rebook online as indicated in the text notification?
116901,124630,@AmericanAir you #failed today for the last time. Bag returned. clearly. open. sorted through. and stuff is broken. http://t.co/8j9u8IeQSp

116912,124641,@AlaskaAir really wanted to get Alaska credit card but don't give social security number over the phone #disappointed
116927,124656,To say we're disappointed with flying internationally on @AmericanAir is an understatement. Very old plane + bad amenities = very long 9h.
116929,124658,SOMEHOW STILL IN AUSTIN. @AmericanAir YOU MAKIN ME SAD.
116931,124660,@SouthwestAir You cancel my flight. tell me to rebook online then tell me I can't &amp; I have to call. Hour and a half later still on hold 
116944,124673,The level of disappointment I have in @united for the way we have been dealt with this evening is unparalleled.
116946,124675,Incre_ble! Flight 6494 de @united lleno y retrasado casi una hora por esperar al piloto. Incredible. we're waiting for the Captain!

116998,124729,Even though we lost an engine.  the pilots @VirginAmerica  still got us back to SFO in one piece. #safeandsound #Professionals
117004,124735,@SouthwestAir and there are many other flights to Chicago that arrive earlier than mine that aren't cancelled. What gives? Why?
117005,124736,I hate money. Why can't I just trade a super amazing hug for a flight ticket? Thoughts @JetBlue ??
117018,124749,@AmericanAir you ruined my life today
117026,124757,@AmericanAir guess what? As predicted AA2400 going to be late.  Remember. when I predicted this last week? #psychic

117162,124904,@SouthwestAir this duel boarding thing makes paying for early bird boarding a rip off. People way behind me got better choices. Money back?
117166,124909,I'm told that the first @united flights always leave 10 mins earlier than scheduled and I should've read the policy to be aware of that. 
117172,124915,"The best @AmericanAir could offer was to check in at the airport. So now the 6'3"" guy has a seat that won't recline. Never again."
117174,124917,I think @United should fly me to New York in BF.  I didnt get this year and I'm missing the city. There's no other way to fly!
117186,124929,Made in Kenya by Alive &amp; Kicking. My upcycled @SouthwestAir seat leather soccer ball arrived this weekend. http://t.co/bYZVAOayzZ

117189,124932,The key to booking @AmericanAir mileageruns. skip booking seats. I miss booking some BOS-LAX trips that way.
117194,124938,Lol. the story of my day starting at 4:30am this today. Honestly surprised at the pile-on of terrible by @JetBlue http://t.co/tWaEQYQVqN

117221,124968,If it wasn't snowing today. the missing door seal for the rear aircraft door wouldn't have been noticed? Yikes! Wish @united would update us

117255,125005,It appears that @americanair AAgents aren't seeing recently released CX award space. Anyone else having issues?  #frustration #mergermadness
117259,125009,"@united don't say flight is delayed for 2 hrs to ""severe weather"" when everyone has been told it's bc of a mech issue and we smelled smoke."

117266,125016,Remember that time @JetBlue cancelled my flight without even a sorry and I was treated horribly by their staff? #ido #jetblue #travelhorrors
117267,125017,@AmericanAir Double checking: I can only call 800-428-4322 to reschedule a US Airways flight out of ORD cancelled by snow? No to the AA #?

117274,125024,Can't wait for @VirginAmerica service from DAL to AUS... No more cattle calls and super-cramped seating after April.

117284,125035,@united what's with your fares from OMA-IND.. Delta got you beat by 200$. I don't want to switch airlines this year...
117287,125040,@SouthwestAir stuck on plane in Des Moines because of bad weather in Chicago. Your flight attendants are making the most of a bad situation.

117298,125051,@DeltaAssist stuck on fly 2282 in Minneapolis!  No resolution...  What is Delta going to do to compensate for lost vacation?
117303,125056,@united I'm okay with snow issues but if I ask a question after waiting in line don't be rude! Agent at f14 for 6038
117312,125066,I think I'm gonna become a @JetBlue shareholder just to neutralize my disappointment over the end of free bags
117325,125079,@DeltaAssist middle seat and a late arrival.  Delta is not doing it for me today.
117345,125101,shoutout to @united for sucking

117364,125121,SO impressed by the @AlaskaAir stewardesses and medical volunteers who didn't miss a beat with an inflight medical emergency. #flight506
117371,125128,@united you can get me on a flight back to Fargo and not cancel it for the 4th time today
117378,125135,@SouthwestAir we just returned off flight of southwest and it will be families last time I thought highly of them for years and never a prob

117380,125137,Curve ball. 2 extra days in Oregon as @SouthwestAir goes kablooey in Portland. Too bad we have little interest in those Spokane games now
117383,125140,Our @SouthwestAir flight to Dallas is delayed because of weather in Chicago. Curse you Mother Nature. #wannagethome
117385,125143,Frustrating with #Expedia so called #AlaskaAir directly. Was calm &amp; polite &amp; got flight changed no fee. Thanks @AlaskaAir #NiceGuysFinish1st
117394,125153,@united yes they booked me for a flight later today so I had to get a hotel and miss school today since they could only confirm me on a 2pm
117397,125156,@SouthwestAir on hold for 29:15 so far. Trying to change a flight today: the website doesn't give all of the info.Real people working today?
117408,125168,Hi. Jordan!  To clarify. the wait had little to do with @AlaskaAir - we arrived at the airport seven hours early for flight.
117409,125169,@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for 58 minutes and 27 seconds trying to change a flight... Is this normal or should I hang up and try again
117414,125174,@united Filled out missing item form for my MacBook charger left in 29L seatback on UA 847 3/21. but Santiago Chile is not a dest. option.
117419,125179,@AlaskaAir Is Alaska no longer boarding passengers without carry on bags first?
117425,125185,@SouthwestAir got text that first leg of travel BNA to BWI pushed off 4 hours. but no info on connection home to BDL. On hold over 45 min?
117428,125188,@SouthwestAir this is just unbelievable. How many luggage did you guys lost. I am in Florida. I HAD to call you guys and wait 30 minutes.
117436,125196,Can't wait til @SouthwestAir finds my bag they miraculously lost on my direct flight from SXSW. I look like a greasy cowhand in Times Square
117441,125201,@united if I have a ticket via awards travel &amp; have to cancel. site says fee *may* apply. How do I know. Maybe worth it to just lose the pts
117456,125217,@united As if this could get worse... They're now taking a role call on the plane. #third attempt #Chicago #byeOhio
117462,125223,@SouthwestAir missing all my flights b/c your agents messed up my reservation. Told was due to snow. no snow on east coast. What's up?
117466,125227,@SouthwestAir if you're going to keep me on hold for so long at least play better music. #CustomerExperience http://t.co/d7dDGYc3v2
117472,125234,I never connected that the @AlaskaAir logo was an Eskimo... Always thought it was a dude with an Afro. It makes a lot more sense now.
117475,125237,"having a lot of trouble booking my hotel via @JetBlue - page after i click ""book room"" never loads regardless of browser."
117478,125240,@DeltaAssist I will DM you. I just wanted to make sure my family and friends knew my situation and never go through the same experience.
117495,125258,@deltaassist what is the response time for this?  It seems like you're avoiding the issue.
117504,125267,@VirginAmerica Can you help me cancel my flight and refund on my credit card?

117521,125284,@JetBlue thanks for a response. unfortunately there have been no announcements regarding a delay. so I'm not sure what the hold up is
117531,125295,Weather must be causing @united problems today #hour5waiting http://t.co/AHbLBLdmN7
117535,125299,"@united Its not my style to ""out"" the specific employee. Maybe she was having a bad day."

117567,125331,@DeltaAssist I've got a 14 hour trip from U.S. tomorrow night to the UK via Paris on 25th. Is this likely to be cancelled due to strike?
117568,125332,. @JetBlue #FlyingItForward had 2 cancel annual #Florida trip &amp; stuck in #Connecticut where we still have loads of snow on ground - save me!
117571,125335,"@JetBlue noticing lots of ""can't check in on the iOS app"" tweets online. Having the same problem. Any fix in place?"

117771,125547,Today was spent at Hobby. Not sure why @SouthwestAir decided to cancel a full flight instead of replace the plane. At least it's warm here?

119330,127208,@VirginAmerica flying to ny with you from sfo today can't wait! First trip there
119333,127211,@united apparently u don't want me that badly.  After a 17 minute wait on hold I was told you wouldn't match the 25K miles I've accrued this
119346,127227,@AlaskaAir even with a technical delay. we still made it to our destination on time. Exceptional service. Compliments to Captain and Crew :)
119348,127229,Maui has NEVER been this low from #Winnipeg.  $550 taxes in one stop on @United departing April 6th! http://t.co/kMQ6jZvUv2

119363,127245,@AmericanAir worst trip startin in Alexandria. LA.  Been a customer for years it might be time to let them go.  Sorry you broke my heart.
119366,127248,@united Your customer service rep gave us bad info. Now have to miss flight and fly to different city
119379,127263,Despite the inconvenience thank you to @JetBlue for doing all they can to get us to Florida tonight #customerservice
119387,127271,Because of @AmericanAir today Ive missed a full day in Jamaica. Both airplanes I was on were broken. Never flying with them again.

119404,127288,About to miss my flight what should I do? @united
119415,127299,I'm going to have less than 30 min between flights now &amp; @united wants me to gate check my bag and wait for it when I arrive. How about no.
119419,127303,@DeltaAssist DL 2238 Atlanta to DC. Inbound flight from Minneapolis where issue occurred.
119441,127326,@united this weeks flights = fail again. It's time to take my 1k miles a year somewhere else. Let the status match process begin.
119449,127334,@DeltaAssist Little late. Arrived F1 in ATL. Taking off from C33 in 13 minutes. Amazingly no transport for 2M diamond. Not the first time.
119452,127337,@SouthwestAir So sad that SW has stopped flying direct from Atlanta to Jamaica. Our trip last December on SW was one of the best flights.
119454,127339,@AmericanAir There was a schedule change on my reservation and the later flight time is inconvenient for me.
119456,127341,@AmericanAir you are going to force me to another airline with this US Airways group. Pretentious and rude coast to coast. Where's my AA ?
119459,127344,".@united I was told at the gate that I can't switch to a wide open earlier flight because I don't have ""status"" way to shit on me"
119479,127364,@united did you discontinue the nonstop route between New Orleans and San Francisco? There are no flights avail in June. PLEASE NO!!!!!!!
119482,127367,@united club lounges make airport waits so much easier why have I never done this before
119489,127375,@AmericanAir any reason the bulkhead window seat I paid for on AA1600 changed to a crappy middle seat further back in the plane?
119491,127379,@SouthwestAir Flew w/ya'll last wknd. DAL/Love crew rocked. but best get the AT/ Atl. crews up to speed though~ their Cust.Svc sucked

119495,127383,@JetBlue Thank u as always for ur amazing service. Friend of mine decided on another airline today and his is delayed. Should have picked u

120584,128544,my @JetBlue experience went from a bad one to a good one all thanks to their online support!
120585,128545,I hope @SouthwestAir will at least comp this $70 cab fare back to San Diego bc those buses down are nowhere in sight. Sad day.

120633,128596,@AmericanAir All 5 flights from FLL to ORD are delayed today?  1168 is mechanical but what are the rest?
120641,128604,@DeltaAssist safety is always 1st priority yes but the delay could have been prevented if deicing was scheduled ahead of departure

120828,128807,Trying to book a flight with @AmericanAir but it looks like their booking has server issues.
120834,128813,@SouthwestAir Are all you deal with are complaints?
120838,128817,@united the best yall can do for me is a flight laying over TOMORROW in denver to SBA... and why would i even do that when it'll be delayed
120841,128822,@JetBlue Oh sad. I confused you with another airline. I have #JetBlue on the mind!
120844,128826,@DeltaAssist Remind me to never fly Delta again. I will take a bus.train.or ride a bike to South Dakota before looking at any Delta flights!

120974,128960,Don't ever fly @united they will close the door before they are suppose to. sell your tickets standby too early. and lie about delay reasons
120976,128962,Mad props to @SouthwestAir ! Threw a little swag our way for the inconvenience of some unexpected delays to our travel. LUV Southwest!
120980,128966,@AmericanAir Who knew a DELAYED flight could leave before check in. Very thankful #dallas has #southwestair going direct everywhere now.

121017,129006,A 50 minute boarding process for a plane from Vegas to San Francisco is completely unnecessary. You suck. @united.
121034,129024,@SouthwestAir You might want to tell your pilots not to slam into the runway at #OAK. Bad landing coming in from #Vegas.
121051,129042,Why is there nobody here?! I'm going to miss my flight!!! @AmericanAir http://t.co/j9h9aaEevS

121226,129230,Not sure what's going on with @SouthwestAir in Phoenix checkin lines out the door &amp; craziness #nothappy http://t.co/faQz4coLlX
121227,129231,Detesting @AlaskaAir with the fire of a million suns. Never again.
121231,129235,@DeltaAssist any programs if I want to switch back to Delta Sky miles? Left to go to Dividend miles couple of years ago.
121247,129252,Now stranded in the Phoenix airport with a @SouthwestAir line that wraps around 2 escalators &amp; out the door. How I hate you. Southwest.
121254,129259,@DeltaAssist Flight home also delayed. Probably Chicago weather.
121261,129266,I'm on the phone with @AmericanAir and their music while you're on hold is funky hip-hop I'm really digging it
121263,129268,@AmericanAir Hi. Flying from Lima to London via Miami. Over 12 hours wait in Miami. can I leave the airport?
121266,129271,@AlaskaAir Can we get a follow - we noticed a (somewhat) significant issue with our MVP75k package.
121273,129278,Hanging out at the airport.  @AlaskaAir has a broken plane.
121274,129279,Hanging out at the airport.  @AlaskaAir has a broken plane.
121280,129285,Why does it seem like every flight is delayed these days??? @AlaskaAir flight 614 Sea to Vegas. was 11:45am. now 12:20pm
121281,129286,Waiting on the runway and plane engine doesn't start...  Back to the gate we go!  And the travel game begins! @AmericanAir
121293,129300,@AmericanAir are a bunch of thieves
121295,129302,@JetBlue Not too bad. Having flight withdraws.
121300,129307,No bags from @AlaskaAir means no pool time in #Vegas today. Bummer. Hopefully my numbers don't go missing at the roulette table.
121311,129318,@AmericanAir I have had a horrible time with your airlines. Missed my connecting flight last Thursday and missed my connecting flight today
121317,129324,Oh and I am still not really checked in because app @united wants to make traveling with an under-2 the most stressful thing ever 
121321,129328,Folks you never replied https://t.co/8RbGHT1kcQ @AmericanAir
121326,129333,Really. @southwestair? It makes more sense to try to repair a plane in DSM &amp; fly it to Chicago MDW than to find a plane there? #logistics
121328,129335,@united your app is lying.. airplane here. flight attendant broke the plane. #UnitedAirlines #pantsonfire #whythelie http://t.co/9Fdfc8r2xX

121363,129372,@SouthwestAir why your flight to/fro SF-LA always delayed.. :(
121365,129374,@AlaskaAir FYI. this is a fail. One agent. slower than molasses. http://t.co/ElSA8bAXxI
121368,129378,@AmericanAir i am expecting some miles posted on my account. should I be waiting a little longer with the combination of both systems?
121371,129381,@united - Dulles is consistently 35+ minutes. Double the wait time of any other domestic airport. I've complained for two years. No change.
121372,129382,Thank You @VirginAmerica for remembering that INXS Kick is always on the top 10 album list http://t.co/PeHKhaVUKd
121376,129386,.@SouthwestAir I'm a bit concerned about my delayed flight from PIT to RSW. It's the last one today so I really need it to not be canceled.

121528,129551,@united overseas employees explained that my travel certificate is only valid to the states. No need to bother. Not flying with you again.
121533,129556,@DeltaAssist how do I claim a missing segment on my miles?
121534,129557,@SouthwestAir Seriously? No multi-city flight search option? Flight search experience is diabolical. You just lost a potential customer

122076,130135,Sadly @AmericanAir check in personnel in Buenos Aires is a horror. Slow. No energy. Bad all around. #BAD
122078,130137,"@AlaskaAir just watched shit drag queens say and am still pissing at ""if you're not doing drag the you are NOT doing drag""  #hiiiiiiii"

122130,130192,@JetBlue - I have the worst seat available on Flight 434 (Friday). Any chance of getting a better seat if I write you a poem?
122137,130199,I really wish @SouthwestAir flew to some of the smaller airports in the west!  They would have made my connecting flight wait for me!
122139,130201,You're killing me again @united just killing me. Done with you.
122140,130202,I miss @SouthwestAir. I'm never cheating on you with Delta again.

122163,130227,Apparently you can only cancel a full reservation online with @SouthwestAir and not just one leg of it. That's inconvenient.
122166,130230,@united 1st flight was late. took off late causing me to miss my connecting flight. waiting to board my flight at 8:50. #longday
122170,130234,@AlaskaAir The hell we are.

122203,130268,@AlaskaAir it's botching tickets. stranding fliers in Sacramento. lying to them. and acting utterly rude #AlaskaBeyond
122211,130276,Last night a non-stop flight from Memphis to Dallas was $1200! All that ends April 8 and I can't wait! You suck rocks Delta! @SouthwestAir
122214,130279,@JetBlue is making me miss my grandmothers funeral.

122279,130349,Really. @united? Your agents make Group 5 wait until even the LATE Group 1-4 passengers arrive before letting them board? Insensitive...

122320,130392,@SouthwestAir come on swa!  Way to cancel my flt 2 wks in a row to MDW wout even notifying me
122323,130395,@AlaskaAir could use your help. We've had a family emergency and need to cancel a refundable DCA-SEA flight. Can't reschedule it yet.
122328,130400,Never been on a flight where disabled people are the 5th to board @virginamerica
122329,130401,Can you believe I've never stepped foot on an airplane? @SouthwestAir
122338,130410,"@AmericanAir that's the problem. where was the customer relations during the situation? It's always "" we're sorry"" after."
122340,130412,@JetBlue I miss the old list of which flights had Fly-Fi. The widget doesn't work on mobile devices. Something you are working on?
122341,130413,@AmericanAir Once again the LGA Admirals Club -&amp; Rhina-save the day. Otherwise I'd still be sitting on flight 309 waiting &amp; waiting to leave
122353,130426,Now the heater has grounded the plane. @AlaskaAir F200 out of seattle. They must  have decided against opening the window to fix issue.
122355,130428,Getting fed up with @AmericanAir how long does it take to get a confirmation email to say u cancelled flights ???? Last thing I need!
122357,130430,So like...we missed our flight to San Diego @united
122360,130433,AA 200 from SEA to SJC delay due too a broke heater. 90 degrees on the plane can anyone on the flight teach a bikram yoga class? @Alaskaair

122383,130458,Hi @AmericanAir - can a checked bag be interlined on separate oneworld pnr's? 12hr Lima wait on Fri hoping to stay airside &amp; wait in lounge.

122389,130464,That's a funny prank about Branson. @VirginAmerica. but you still have no flights from NYC to Chicago?
122391,130466,@JetBlue online checkin hangs after clicking CHECK IN button - still having computer issues?
122398,130473,@AlaskaAir thanks for getting my lost luggage back to me rather quickly! Appreciate it :) #pants
122404,130479,@AmericanAir Is it bad that 1.5 weeks of no flying feels like a long time? #welcomeaboard #roadwarrior #travel
122408,130483,$380 credit for ticket I had to cancel. Except now there's a $200 change fee to use it. Few moments I've thought @united is screwing me over
122418,130494,@SouthwestAir  It was a late flight. I asked to keep my cup of ice. she politely told me she couldn't allow such a thing. #policyIguess
122422,130498,@AmericanAir I am trying to book a flight for today due to a medical emergency and have been on hold over 20 minutes. :(

122438,130515,So @VirginAmerica will now fly to Branson. MO but still no flights to Hawaii?!
122439,130516,-@united: I need an airline that 1/informs ppl beforehand when facing a significant delay 2/communicates what's going on &amp; 3/solves pblms

122462,130539,I must be broken. the customer service at @AlaskaAir was so nice and helpful I wasn't sure how to handle it and ended up apologizing...
122464,130541,Thoughtful attendant @SouthwestAir flight from Vegas - Phx saw me eating a messy orange and brought me a wet towel. It's the little things_
122467,130544,My company's travel agent booked my airline tix to #pycon under maiden name. Passport is married name. Will this be a problem @united?
122471,130548,"@SouthwestAir  A wedding where ""That girl is poison"" is playing. nay be a bad omen! LOL"
122472,130549,40 minute delay because the plane needed gas. No one thought of topping off ahead of time? @united
122483,130560,I love you @VirginAmerica please make my flight longer it's flight 330 thanks bae
122498,130576,Already missed my connection &amp; @AlaskaAir put me up in a hotel. but now a security breach in #Juneau airport has everyone outside security.
122500,130578,@AlaskaAir Apple Pay onboard please? #ApplePay it sucks having to keep a credit card around with the risk of misplacing it.
122501,130579,.@AmericanAir I filled out the form &amp; no response. Since you check your Twitter. here's a link to my full complaint http://t.co/aW3Of2IRWF
122506,130585,Another great experience flying with @JetBlue. The crews in Costa Rica-Liberia. NY-JFK and Boston-Logan made a potentially bad day better.

122538,130619,@SouthwestAir we leave Orlando this week &amp; have a plane change in Houston; does our Early Bird cover both boarding?
122544,130626,I really love @VirginAmerica but not really happy with Elevate. I've been waiting almost 10 wks for my companion pass for 2015 #AlmostApril
122546,130628,Wow. The boarding guy said 30 seconds later and I would have missed my flight. Thank you @JetBlue. I love you.
122547,130630,When your meatball 15 lb triplet blows a microchip. the other one blows out a diaper. and 3rd is starving. @SouthwestAir #wannagetaway
122556,130642,@AlaskaAir quick question. we have to cancel our flight for May. Is there a cancellation fee?
122564,130650,Hey @SouthwestAir. the pilot going from ATL-DCA At 3:30pm was a badass landed us in such crazy conditions! #grateful
122579,130666,@VirginAmerica hates women who breastfeed #fail
122582,130669,#shoutout to @SouthwestAir for realizing that my fianc was going to miss his connecting flight to AUS so they switched his flight!
122585,130672,Arg trying to book a flight on @VirginAmerica and have gotten an error code like 4 times after getting all the way through. So frustrating.
122600,130687,I'm really questioning the value of flying @SouthwestAir. Early-Bird checkin gets me a B boarding position? You've lost my loyalty.
122602,130689,Still stuck in Chicago. @AmericanAir has back to back mechanical failures on two planes. Gahhh I just want to get home!
122604,130691,What is going on @AlaskaAir? My last 3 flights in the last 2 weeks have been delayed! :(
122605,130692,hey @united maybe your pilot should check and see if the plane is capable of flying BEFORE boarding and have us wait past our LANDING time
122610,130697,@united Loving the stellar customer service... Oh wait. there isn't any. Per usual. Now I remember why I don't fly with you
122611,130698,@DeltaAssist why did the tech department  lie &amp; tell me there is nothing wrong with the delta app
122628,130715,I really hope @SouthwestAir still lets me use my flight I missed _ #shamelesstweet
122632,130719,@DeltaAssist Im gonna miss my connection and need to rebook my flight!
122637,130724,@United I would rather the fight from Dulles to Charleston.WV be cancelled than to wait and hope the repairs work on this next plane #UA4805
122638,130725,I don't understand why people seem to like @JetBlue -- They've failed me nearly every time. including tonight.
122639,130726,Somehow the airplane cleaners missed this gem. #travelprobs #frequenttravelers #seenitall @united http://t.co/fEw7Sw7Jin

122661,130749,@United sad to see no meal on flight tonight - but it IS a late flight.  #flyerfriendly
122664,130752,@United holding us hostage on the airplane. UA4875 arrives early only to have to wait 40 minutes for a gate. No way to run an airline!
122692,130780,@AlaskaAir 3451 I'd like to know why it was delayed
122694,130782,@VirginAmerica I'll never fly with anyone else
122697,130785,Flight was supposed to leave 8:05. now 9:47.  @JetBlue as much as I love waiting at the airport for hours. seriously? http://t.co/LXvsZqzHvK
122708,130797,Everything was going so good @VirginAmerica until you forced 140 peeps into a 35-person bus in the middle of Tarmac at #JFK
122715,130805,@SouthwestAir I don't know why...but I'm on an American flight. I can't wait to come back to the luv! ___
122717,130807,@DeltaAssist Do Skybonus vouchers need to be redeemed and travel by 1 year from date of issue? Or just issued by expiration date?
122720,130810,@AmericanAir why can't I cancel my flight w/ out fees?
122745,130839,@united I flew international both ways first class full rate. Got my bag. last off the carrousel. Almost missed flight.
122757,130851,@united can US citizens w/ US billing addresses not buy one-way tix from Canada to US? Looking to book return but wait on booking departure.

122809,130903,Hi @united. have you see what a disaster security at EWR looks like today. Premier Access is meaningless. Many passengers will miss flights
122810,130904,The old monitors on my @AmericanAir flight are flickering so badly. the safety video looks like a they borrowed a 4th hand copy VHS.
122811,130905,@JetBlue that's insane to charge $100 to change a flight reservation! #illstickwithsouthwest #thatscrazy
122824,130919,@DeltaAssist international flight isn't even packed and it has skyrocketed smh. It's so unnecessary that it is sad... especially since your
122827,130922,@SouthwestAir all of my friends are going away for spring break &amp; I am stuck with 30 degree weather! Send me somewhere warmmmm__
122828,130923,@JetBlue put me in first class.. Oh wait there is none.

123907,132092,@AmericanAir Are you having problems with the AA iPhone app? It's having trouble loading my flights.
123908,132094,How many people miss airline connections each time Air Force One demands a clear airspace? @SouthwestAir #DTWtoSTL #landedinchicago
123919,132105,@united I almost checked to see if I could switch my flight because that tweet was annoying. Won't book United again because of it.
123924,132110,@SouthwestAir why dont you want me to book my ticket with you? Trying to travel with friends and you switched the pricing 4 times... #sketch

123955,132142,Disappointed. epic trip booked with @AlaskaAir rewards does not entitle us to benefits on carrier we are flying. would have liked to know
123962,132149,The security questions asked by @AmericanAir are a joke and a waste of time.
123964,132151,Headed to the airport but I'm probably going to miss my @united flight...
123976,132163,Surprised by @AlaskaAir being in term c now on BOS.  Will miss the board room access to Delta club
123979,132166,Never flown 1st class in @VirginAmerica however it's beautiful.... hate flying but it may just help the ride! #AOSCommerial

124032,132223,@JetBlue -does SFO not participate in Even More Speed? I paid for it and TSA had never heard of it before??
124044,132236,@united oversold first class. and now they're kicking first class passengers who were upgraded. out. Such a very Jeff $mi$ek thing to do.
124048,132240,@JetBlue  grrrrrr http://t.co/NRjg1O3cOP
124050,132242,Late Seattle nights and Friday morning flights. Gotta love @VirginAmerica! http://t.co/5zzXl8tRBH

124068,132262,@SouthwestAir anxiously awaiting my girls trip in 2 weeks but no drink coupons have arrived this year. Sad face. Are they sent annually?

124076,132270,But in all seriousness. @AlaskaAir has the BEST employees. They were so helpful and never made me feel bad for getting sick. What angels.
124077,132271,@SouthwestAir is it possible to change one leg of my trip? Trying to cancel one way but it only seems to let me cancel the whole trip.
124081,132277,Despite your early morning computer glitch on 3/30. I arrived at my destination early. Never been disappointed. Thanks @JetBlue
124087,132283,Not one time have I ever had to wait parked on the tarmac while flying @SouthwestAir. Other carriers? I wait every time I fly.
124090,132286,Praying my flights delayed so I can watch the rest of Laura's game! @AlaskaAir
124091,132287,I've missed you. @VirginAmerica http://t.co/Gwu1pzYZ6Q

124168,132369,@AmericanAir stuck in Wichita Falls.  where's the fuel??
124175,132376,@AmericanAir I did. just the reason doesn't make sense. I'm gonna avoid PHL in the future hopefully that's the issue as I like flying with U
124183,132384,@JetBlue delayed flights are worse when you're traveling with a pet.
124185,132386,@SouthwestAir who can I talk to about an issue I had on a recent trip?

124269,132471,@SouthwestAir that does not answer or solve my issue at all
124271,132473,@united airlines is instilling confidence in me. Late arrival of the crew and a broken door that won't close. Rock on. guys.

124409,132615,@DeltaAssist no but we won't fly delta now.  Not our fault you couldn't fill up a flight. Didn't  delta expect a slow start in this market?
124410,132616,@AlaskaAir please advise as to why flight 505 from SNA-SEA is delayed.  Thank you.
124417,132623,@DeltaAssist Just got home from my flight from atl to pit.   I flew first class.  New boarding system with the lines like southwest is awful

124865,133098,@DeltaAssist hi delta assist. My problem is that it's not just a safety issue its a cust service issue
124867,133100,@DeltaAssist why are you trying to mislead us here waiting for flight 476? The delay is your lack of proper ground crew. What's the truth?
124868,133101,I hate @AmericanAir
124870,133103,Bravo @VirginAmerica you're flight attendants and pilots knew I was a bad flyer and made me feel like royalty. Having anxiety can be so fun!
124874,133107,Thanks Christen for rebooking me on tomorrow's @JetBlue flight out of JFK!   You were kind and patient amidst a growing and angry crowd.
124880,133113,@JetBlue unfortunately no updates from the ground crew. Past departure time and no clue how much longer.....
124883,133116,Come on @SouthwestAir gonna make me miss my connecting flight in Vegas
124887,133120,Broken jetway puts us on the Tarmac at Houston Intercontinental for early morning @AmericanAir flight. #home http://t.co/y3kUc59717
124889,133122,Tried to catch an earlier flight home bc my Grandpa died but @AmericanAir won't let me. So forced to stay at the Dallas airport longer!
124892,133125,@JetBlue FYI. flight status feature on your website appears to be broken. Works on my phone but not on computer (Chrome. Safari or Firefox).
124893,133126,Think my wallet gets stolen so cancel my @AmericanAir American Express green card... Then I find it. Such an idiot ___
124894,133127,@jetblue flight 358 : super happy BUR is getting screwed over LAX to JFK tonight.  Great mgmt of your flights w/r to runway work.  Not.
124914,133147,@AlaskaAir Had an unpleasant experience on American today. I was using points (maybe that was the reason). Missed u today. you are the best.
124916,133149,@AlaskaAir May I know the reason for asking for the ticket number. I have sent them yest and no response. Typical alaska customer service.
124917,133150,Not happy with @JetBlue. iPad broke. protective case... Nobody seems to care...
124920,133153,@united Hi there. I miss red color in UA livery. Anybody know when we will be able to see again some red color in UA airplanes?
124925,133160,Thank you @AlaskaAir safe #298 flight to Puerto Vallarta. Still missing bag and I am wondering if you can help find 66-62-73
124926,133161,@AmericanAir sched awd tkt for aberlin flt today txl-ord. never told flt was canceled and rebooked for tomorrow. Found out at airport.
124939,133174,@AmericanAir if i miss the first leg of my itinerary will the rest still be there?
124944,133180,@JetBlue lots of unhappy people here. They just told us that we need to wait for a gate to open up.
124951,133188,@VirginAmerica waiting in line for pre-paid bags. This is taking waaaaay too long. Pre-paid means faster not slower people!
124956,133193,@JetBlue coming through and ruining the vaca
124957,133194,@DeltaAssist question - if I am currently gold medallion. am I able to qualify for platinum in the same year or have to wait for 2016?

125013,133254,Are you fucking kidding me @JetBlue??? They just announced there will be no bathroom on the plane.
125017,133259,Everything is amazing and nobody's happy because we're all waiting for the crew for this @JetBlue flight.
125024,133267,In flight crew late?? How is that possible? Sitting waiting to board flight 1817 to POS. Happy Easter @JetBlue

125045,133288,@VirginAmerica a big thank you to Elmer at Team SFO. He was such a big help in getting our baggage issue fixed. Elmer. Happy Easter!
125049,133293,In addition @JetBlue needs to extend it's destinations to Toronto Canada at least so I can stop deal with other shit airlines totally
125050,133294,Platinum status. million miles. club card &amp; explorer cards. and STILL charge $25 for wife's bag on same reservation?  Bad form @united
125057,133302,Phoenix airport @SouthwestAir lines again out of control. closed kiosks. packed like sardines. #disappointed http://t.co/anEdLBqqS3

125060,133305,@DeltaAssist why are you not returning my email about my missing miles. Can you please contact me? http://t.co/lqu50jfofV
125061,133306,@DeltaAssist I just had to send my wife through security at SFO alone with my crying newborn because your agent wouldnt issue a gate pass.
125069,133314,@JetBlue why is flight 928 out of orlando delayed?
125078,133324,@JetBlue do you have a scanning system to track lost baggage?
125081,133327,@DeltaAssist So how do I claim these miles for baggage that takes longer than 20 minutes to arrive? #StillWaiting
125083,133329,shoutout to @SouthwestAir for pulling through and not delaying my flight for the first time
125085,133331,Can someone tell this little faggot to stop kicking my seat @SouthwestAir
125086,133332,@AmericanAir -Will wait patiently for a response.
125089,133335,@JetBlue I just wanted to thank you for hiring rude. disrespecting workers. because of Marisol at MCO I won't be enjoying Easter dinner!!!

125124,133372,@DeltaAssist I need assistance with corporate number regarding delay of flight dl55
125132,133411,@AmericanAir hi. sorry for the delay. but no dice.  This only shows the receipt for the airfare itself.

125168,133450,@JetBlue yet another late flight. Can't believe we paid $50 each to switch to this one.
125170,133452,I really wish it wasn't too late to change our flights to @AmericanAir and just not have to deal with this hassle.
125177,133459,@united ok ua1462 has now been delayed over 30 minutes. Plane completely packed and not a word from pilots. #United what's going on?
125183,133465,@DeltaAssist need to make sure my rescheduled flight for tomorrow will not be a disappointment. tkt#2302593606 confirm# GQNRYW
125186,133469,@DeltaAssist as a mdl plat sky miles. It sucked when sky miles lounge turned my family and I away...cause we were flying American not Delta?
125188,133471,@AmericanAir u chgd run flights didn't tell us look up issues 12/19-12/2. Jessica E posted F1ZTQJ extrem poor service recovery do it pik AA
125190,133473,@JetBlue the crew on flight #1801 are killing it right now. Probably the best flight I've had yet #awesomebluecrew
125204,133488,Delayed flights are a real doozy. Ugh. @JetBlue you're killing me today. Not that I want to go back to the cold but I don't wanna sit here
125205,133489,Rough end to our trip: @SouthwestAir cancelled our flight back to Nashville. Stuck us in this hotel for the night. http://t.co/bV96v3SpdX
125208,133492,#EWR Terminal A is now offering travelers the choice of hot yoga or sweating your ass off while waiting for your @united regional jet.
125217,133501,I contact @united because of an issue and they blame my travel agent hmmm I travel all the time never had an issue with my agent #excuses
125220,133504,@SouthwestAir The maintenance issue w/ the oxygen tank should have been taken care of last night after they used it.
125232,133516,This NY trip continues courtesy of @united canceling my flight. It's not like I need to be at work tomorrow. Oh wait. I do. #UnitedSucks
125235,133519,@JetBlue is 2 for 2 on broken TVs for  this weekend flights... #evenmorelegroom gets you #evermorebroken

125297,133584,@SouthwestAir Why is a replacement craft for for 3406 just now being sent? They were working on the mechanical issue for hours in Indy.
125311,133601,When your flight gets delayed til midnight&lt;&lt; TY @SouthwestAir See you tomorrow LA
125340,133631,Abysmal job by @AmericanAir with AA23. instead of letting us go back to the gate forcing us to wait on Tarmac will misconnect w/no options
125345,133636,I was just starting to like @united and then they go and lose my baggage! Worst end to a vacation possible.
125354,133646,@JetBlue thank you so much for reaching out and caring about the bad experience I had today shows me that you guys truly care :)
125361,133653,Can't believe how rude and condescending a @JetBlue employee spoke to me and my mom today. Is that what 2 $800 tix gets you?  #jetblue
125368,133661,I may not have missed my flight but I missed my @SouthwestAir honey roasted peanuts due to napping.
125369,133662,I know new @AmericanAir elite cards take 6 wks but how much longer 4 mine 2 arrive down under? I need it 2 access a Qatar lounge soon!

125439,133733,I'll never understand why they dont board passengers onto the plane from back 2 front. Probably makes too much sense. right @VirginAmerica ?
125450,133746,@AmericanAir flight 3321 late due to weather. but you pulled the flight crew off to not inconvenience them.  #stuck  when's departure?
125455,133751,NEG - @UNITED crew for flight UA597 decided not to show up today . . . #SpringBreak . . . guess we'll start that tomorrow. #Competency #FAIL
125465,133761,@AmericanAir Hi. I'm still waiting for my 273$ refund!

125471,133767,@AmericanAir http://t.co/OmFnlxQY70 is not recognizing my AAdvantage number when I go to buy a flight - is this a known issue?
125476,133772,We always wonder why the San Diego to San Francisco @SouthwestAir flight never has wi fi.  SFO is the tech capital of the world
125478,133774,That moment when you realize all your new AKA goodies are missing from your checked bag #wannacry @SouthwestAir
125480,133776,@VirginAmerica I feel asleep at the terminal and missed my flight! Tell Mr Branson he has lovely staff and cant wait to fly VX! xx

125488,133785,@united argh! This mechanical error on flight 4972 is going to make me miss a very important meeting!
125499,133796,@AlaskaAir took a dive on the ice in the RDM parking lot this AM and missed my flight. Marty came through for me. You guys rock.
125502,133799,Alaska airlines never seems to disappoint me. I had a good flight to Vegas from Anchorage. The crew were very friendly @AlaskaAir
125504,133801,@AmericanAir ok but my old card was stolen so I need to get them another card number
125507,133804,@DeltaAssist when u tell us we'll be deplaning for a maintenance issue. then later that maybe we'll fly this plane after all: nervewracking.
125515,133813,@DeltaAssist I'm on DELTA 981 (BOS-ATL) tomorrow but need to switch to DELTA 105 (BOS-ATL). Can this be switched since it's within 24 hrs?
125519,133817,@DeltaAssist Specifically chose A380; but plane changed to 777. Too bad Delta won't let me tweak flight w/o higher fees. Sigh.
125521,133819,Even though I'm flying Delta I want to thank the nice lady at @AlaskaAir for helping me when my bag broke.

125568,133866,@DeltaAssist is it too late to add my TSA pre check to my reservation?
125571,133869,"@AmericanAir I just watched ""Annie""(2014) on my flight and the car chase scene at the end was awful. Please consider the Fast&amp;Furious series"
125574,133872,@AmericanAir. bought 3 first class seats. Mechanic no shows. got rerouted(coach). no luggage. asked for refund.  Them: sorry you had to wait
125576,133874,@AlaskaAir and we met those criteria; this much was acknowledged by the reservation desk person. Shame on all of you.
125580,133879,"My @united flight just had to be ""rebooted"" to see if that would fix the issue. Glad the IT guy behind that call knew what was going on."
125581,133880,@DeltaAssist need to cancel red for a flight for today. For my daughter
125585,133884,@JetBlue you give me a $50 credit for poor service. dont tell me its expires after a year. go to use it &amp; its gone? Fantastic.
125588,133888,@SouthwestAir I know what it is and how it works. User said wait to open her station and would not tell me what number was NEXT.
125610,133910,@DeltaAssist I was on hold for 15 min. Sorry. I had to hang up.
125615,133916,@jetblue You guys are awesome! But these are sad times on 'Come Fly With Blue' flight 1059 from #BOS to #PHL http://t.co/7oWoHByvhw
125616,133917,.@VirginAmerica knows how to #keepcalmandcarryon. Delayed flights ain't nothin' but a thang with free refreshments and music to entertain us
125624,133926,@united  really shocking and stressful journey from NYC last night ......
125626,133928,@AlaskaAir no priority security lane open in the middle of the afternoon at DCA? Kind of annoying.
125630,133932,@AmericanAir lousy job in bos. First time with you In ages. Mechanical issues and I'm going to miss my connection.
125648,133950,@SouthwestAir Hi guys! Will flights from MDW to PVR be available in October? Having some issues checking online

125859,134174,@united 2 Dreamliner. 2 mechanical problems and still stuck at LAX. You are shambles of an airline!
125860,134176,@DeltaAssist hi. we were on board when the flight leader told us to get off the plane or leave her on her own. Not really what I'd expect
125861,134177,@SouthwestAir I have 2 complaints! 1. the wifi did not work in the air for regular browsing. after I paid my $8 2. My fragile item is broke!
125867,134183,My fault for a wrong return date US Airways/@americanair but your $200 change fee is more expensive than a new flight on another airline
125870,134186,@DeltaAssist Late aircraft are a hassle but the crew cleaning this plane need retraining #DL2254 http://t.co/P7JOleNTSu

126005,134329,@DeltaAssist the new points program and the e class tickets seem worthless and no longer worth my loyalty to your airline.
126011,134335,Ok @united. You're straight killing me on these flight prices! C'mon man.
126014,134338,@JetBlue I think a flight that was supposed to leave at 9:46 and didn't leave till 12:30 qualifies for compensation.
126017,134341,@AmericanAir you're doing a REALLLY poor job at it!
126019,134343,@AmericanAir is truly disgusting for shipping shark fins. Though you guys were better than that. Done using my american airlines mile card

127590,136003,Calling @AmericanAir = mandatory wasting of time not finding what you need until they give up and let you talk to someone. or you give up.
127594,136007,@AmericanAir they are telling us that we will be going out to the runway and wait there for an hour.  Why are you forcing us to do this?
127599,136012,Went from mia-nassau on @AmericanAir. but they did not issue landing cards on plane so I had to do it while it the line. was there a reason?
127601,136014,I've never seen so many trendy hats before. @VirginAmerica flight to Palm Springs for #Coachella.

127694,136109,@DeltaAssist what is the deal? I can't check in online or on my phone app? What is the problem?
127704,136121,That awesome moment when your flight is delayed for the third time in a row. Thanks @VirginAmerica #flightdelayed

127713,136131,VERY stressed out about flying @SouthwestAir for the first time tomorrow. Will it be scary?!
127714,136132,Number of times in last year that @united has stuck me overnight somewhere. then shrugged &amp; told me I was on my own for lodging. now up to 3
127719,136137,@AmericanAir what is the weather issue in Dallas that caused my flight to be cancelled? http://t.co/MtGa7c4zN1

127753,136173,You cram everyone up in airports with nowhere to go because you don't have a crew to fly your shitty plane @united
127760,136181,This trip reminded me y I don't like flying @united. Had to book them for an emergency trip. It's been years &amp; the experience is still bad.
127761,136182,@united  re ua1447 exactly where is this late inbound crew coming from for 3 hrs France? #delays #lies
127770,136192,@JetBlue Still no response.  I expect better from JetBlue.
127773,136195,@AmericanAir Bingo! Canadair CL-65 is the vessel model to demonstrate that a lack of room in the oversize bins was not the issue here.
127778,136200,@AmericanAir you have lost all my credit card info that was saved under my account. Is this due to merging databases with USAir...??
127787,136209,Waiting for the press release @AmericanAir. Did you ban #sharkfins on your flights or not? #sharkangels http://t.co/jxQg4nZNeo
127819,136244,@SouthwestAir so I missed my travel arrangements because of you all.
127824,136250,Liar. @JetBlue. Not taxiing. Haven't pulled away from the gate. http://t.co/DKOsmb0LTx
127838,136264,@AmericanAir is false advertising.No way to book a child tkt online so I call and call center jacks up the price $50 after I wait for an hr
127841,136268,@AmericanAir isn't there a way to put that in a recording so people know and can decide if they need to wait?
127852,136280,"@AlaskaAir ""We regret the inconvenience she experienced..."" Such statements show you do not accept responsibility. #poorPR #myeloma"
127856,136284,@AlaskaAir hate your N gates. Reconsidering moving status. #iflyalaska #justmissedtrain #75Kgold #perceptionmeanssomething

127871,136301,Well before the plane took off Margot through up on me. Sorry to everyone near us for the smell. @VirginAmerica helped in the aftermath.
127874,136305,@AmericanAir customer service dpt had me wait 2hrs for a call back. finally answered after a 40 minute wait just to be placed on hold again
127877,136308,@JetBlue my pleasure. I always fly you guys. Having the TV was nice during the delay.

127912,136345,.@united is the most God awful airline in history. They're forcing us to listen to the same DirectTV commercial for the 3rd time.
127935,136371,Nightmare @United. Paid $150 to switch to earlier flight. Earlier one took off later. Zero explanation. Missed my mtg. Want refund!

127949,136387,Classc @SouthwestAir sucking.  The only reason I flew with them again was a voucher for the last time they fucked my trip up.  #Neveragain

127952,136390,@AmericanAir you didn't need to loose my suitcase for a joke. Bad airline... Bad

128069,136514,You'd think @AmericanAir would be more accommodating to passengers trying to be proactive and change flights BEFORE there is an issue.
128075,136520,@DeltaAssist flight 5606. MSN-DTW. no coffee in FC. this is becoming all too common. pathetic. why big warn us ahead of time to grab a cup.

128514,136985,The @AlaskaAir app must just check the time and not the actual boarding status. Wrong info is worse than no info. http://t.co/zCVcyAxu52

128553,137024,Mechanical problems are a fact of life @AlaskaAir. but poor communication is within your control. When? http://t.co/AZqidbh2Jk
128557,137028,@SouthwestAir they are doing a real poor job of communicating things here in the terminal
128564,137035,Will likely never fly @SouthwestAir after this debacle in Atlanta. Poor weather is one thing. but this delay was handled like amateurs.
128569,137042,@JetBlue how do you lose a flight attendant? Waiting on 2680 to boston...
128579,137052,@AmericanAir they don't have a contact number for complaints. they'd rather not deal with you. Customers don't matter to them.

130128,138676,@AmericanAir I see Flt 1022 delayed because inbound plane diverted. Are they subbing in a new plane or do they have to wait on other plane?
130134,138683,Thanks a lot @JetBlue - unable to get me from CLT to NYC and no ability to send to other airlines. That makes you a bad risk in the future.
130135,138684,Avoid @united like the PLAGUE! Biz class tix to Ecuador. Cancelled. Surly staff. Hanging up on calls w/ travel agents. Forced into coach.
130138,138687,@AmericanAir board the plane and find that I had been switched to middle seat without being informed. This is poor customer service. period.

131513,140197,@AmericanAir spoken like a true politician. You gloss over the issue with canned responses. I work in soc media. this isn't cust serv.
131523,140207,@AmericanAir TY! We're finally boarded and waiting at the gate for a flight plan? Hoping to be in the air soon!

131778,140471,@DeltaAssist why is SKY PRIORITY at ATL  longer wait then general security this AM?
131779,140472,@AmericanAir The management of US chairmen switching to Exec Plat is awful. Missed upgrades. no status on us air flights - I am Delta bound
131780,140473,Hoping my luggage makes it to Cbus. Prob not smart to check bags at GRR in Ohio State gear! @united 4758 6134 :)

131815,140510,@AmericanAir you completely missed the point.  Not worth any more time trying to explain.
131822,140517,Shoutout to @AmericanAir for destroying the patriarchy by having lady pilots on their security guidelines video
131825,140520,@SouthwestAir we luv you. but sitting on the ramp because of an in-house paperwork issue is getting old... #notfreetomoveaboutthecountry

131873,140568,Oh okay. So we can delay our flight time for 6 people to board but you couldn't do that for us at 5 am. @AmericanAir?
131874,140570,Why I love the Buffalo Airport: you can leave your house. park. and get through security in 26 minutes flat. #Buffalove #BUF @JetBlue

131942,140641,@JetBlue Seriously. no wifi on a flight from JFK to Burbank? I realize it's #firstworldproblems. but that's still a lot of non-connectivity
131948,140647,There is no worse surprise in air travel than @SouthwestAir's open seating when you don't expect it
131956,140655,@DeltaAssist i've been instructed by the manufacturer to not even try to use it.  I literally can't wait 2-4 weeks for this to get resolved
131970,140669,So I guess @AmericanAir wins in the refund battle. Take your $ when you book AND cancel the wrong booking flight in the same day. #Thieves

133289,142060,If #WhiteSox/Tigers was the inflight game. @SouthwestAir. I wouldn't be sad. #SaleDay
133301,142073,I hate @SouthwestAir because is i never. remember to check in and im always stuck between a guy with cheese steak &amp; woman with sweaty thighs
133304,142076,@united can you help me cancel the return leg of my flight? traveling elsewhere for work now

133331,142103,@AmericanAir I still haven't received any call or assistance. If this continues to be the case. my lawyers are on hold to solve this.
133342,142115,I hope @SouthwestAir knows that hundreds-thousands of people are watching the issue with Doryuus fursuit.
133343,142116,@united telling me the flight is late awaiting aircraft. and telling me that aircraft is early is hard to follow.
133346,142119,Never going to fly @AmericanAir again :')
133355,142128,@AmericanAir Okay. U really need to accommodate customers with families better. Still kinda mad we were home at 12 AM when suppose to be 2P
133381,142155,Immigration line at JFK T7 is over 3hrs. Hardly any staff on duty. It's so bad. British passengers are talking to each other @AmericanAir
133385,142160,Wouldn't be a day traveling with @SouthwestAir if I didn't have BOTH of my flights delayed.
133392,142167,Shoutout to @AmericanAir for delaying her flight until tonight
133397,142172,@AmericanAir &amp; I know weather isn't your fault. 10min would have just been a world of diff for me both time and $ wise... #tryingtoletitgo

133450,142228,@SouthwestAir cannot believe I am delayed again!  Once on Wednesday going to Boston and now today! 
133453,142231,Never thought I'd tweet this but @AmericanAir flight 193 from Dallas 2 SF #rockstarcrew #holla

133479,142260,The man next to me smells like shit @SouthwestAir.
133484,142265,@AmericanAir 1212 today. On Wednesday it was 2290. Disturbing that they were both mechanical delays.
133487,142268,Looked up flights for this trip to DR. I obvs missed the date for lower priced flights. Might scrap my vacay bc I just wanna fly @JetBlue.
133494,142277,Thank you @VirginAmerica for hooking it up! Never fly with anyone else! Off we go!!
133508,142291,@VirginAmerica lines at SEA are super slow. No premium lines either today. May miss flight vx796 due to just two security lines at entrance
133518,142302,And the @VirginAmerica website dies on checkin after charging me thanks to a JS Error. Hell of a thing were building.
133522,142306,@AmericanAir How long must I wait on hold?  I am completely disappointed with you.  Call me back. http://t.co/4jGiTztZ2g
133527,142312,ive been a loyal @JetBlue customer for over 10 years. and still not sure why since every single time I fly out of BOS especially I'm delayed
133530,142315,@JetBlue You guys are great. but this has been a really frustrating afternoon/night. Flight B6576 from MSY/JFK.
133536,142321,I should miss flights more often. @AlaskaAir crushing the customer service game today. Easy/cheap change fee + upgraded status.
133547,142332,@JetBlue great service. but a little upset with no meal on a flight to Colombia. and no options of buying a meal. only over priced snacks
133554,142339,@JetBlue where the #*%%# is my luggage?! Still waiting at OAK 40 mins later.
133557,142342,@SouthwestAir Nothing? Don't leave me hanging #swa!
133563,142348,@VirginAmerica The right thing to do is issue a credit for future travel in the same amount of the ticket I bought and paid for.
133568,142356,#wfaaweather diverted my friend's flight to Lubbock! @SouthwestAir says they have to wait out the storms. #DelayedReunion
133571,142359,@AlaskaAir Kudos to the crew of flight 793 for their handling of the medical issue (not ours) on board. They were great.
133572,142360,Hey @AmericanAir have a flight tomorrow to LAX at 3:30. any info on if it's delayed or not or will everything be back on time by then?
133573,142361,United cant wait 3-minutes for us to make connecting flight.  Plane still here. just closed the door on us. Typical @united #stuckOvernight

133627,142416,@united So. the pilot didn't showed up. the made us wait for 2h and now they cancelled the fly... #custumerservice
133632,142421,@AmericanAir I literally could have driven from DC to Austin faster than you could fly me there.  Never again.
133643,142432,@JetBlue can i believe my eyes? did you guys discontinue direct evening service from JFK-OAK? my heart (and maybe patronage :/) is broken. 
133645,142434,@DeltaAssist hope I don't miss my flight. There's about 50 ppl waiting to be checked in.

133664,142456,Shake Shack at 7:30 in the morning is always a good idea. Especially when you have an hour to kill before your @VirginAmerica flight. #JFK

133773,142569,@SouthwestAir What's the deal with the 6PM flight from BOS to BWI? Delayed to leave at 8 PM now?! Some of us need to work tomorrow!!

133823,142620,One of my flights today doesn't exist and the best option @united could offer was a flight tomorrow. No compensation. STILL no confirmation.
133839,142636,researchers who identify problems with [your] products in order to have them fixed are [your] allies @united https://t.co/BGIGjt4zRi
133844,142641,@AmericanAir can you give me email address to send my complaints to.

133870,142668,Any chance I can get an excused absence note for the classes I'm going to miss tomorrow because of my delayed flight. @SouthwestAir?
133871,142669,@AmericanAir it appears I lost my status when your loyalty programs merged. Thoughts?
133873,142671,@VirginAmerica it's no problem' these things happen! Thank you for being the best and ONLY airline I travel with' #FirstClassTreatment 
133879,142677,Not happy with @AlaskaAir right now. Having to wait an hour and a half for them to open their check in counter at IAH airport is just bad.
133882,142680,@DeltaAssist  I would like to upgrade my seat but I been waiting on the phone for a while can you assist me with this task?
133884,142682,@AmericanAir 7hr delay to Miami so missed conn to London. Refused nightmare re-route via Madrid so staying xtra nght St Kitts at own expense

133887,142685,@alaskaair I want to commend Jonathan and the rest of the crew on flight 25. They took exceptional care of me and my broken leg. Thank you!!
133889,142687,@united it was flight 6418! The picture of all pilots in first is quite saddening! I actually support them but it was a BAD look 4 airline!

133912,142713,Okay @AlaskaAir...I don't care about how dirty my bag gets when you take it &amp; put it in cargo but you broke the strap and zipper...
133917,142718,Hi @AmericanAir I have a question about my Platinum Challenge -- waiting for a JAL flight to post so I complete it. and I have travel today.

133925,142726,@SouthwestAir having to wait for the flight crew to eat is unacceptable. We are running late because of this.
133934,142735,@SouthwestAir Why are you guys no longer offering NONSTOP to FLL? Very disappointed in my fav airline. Will have2 look elsewhere
133935,142736,Hey .@AmericanAir I travel all the time and yet u took away my gold status. What gives?! #unhappy

133957,142760,@AlaskaAir why in the world did you cancel my return trip with no notice? #stuckinburbank #nothappy
133958,142761,@VirginAmerica! What happened to the representatives? There's a few of us here waiting to be helped and no one in SEA knows where they are.

134042,142851,Dear @AlaskaAir. I'm happy you caught the maintenance problem; shouldn't that have been done prior to boarding and almost taking off? (1/2)
134048,142857,@united I like that thing you do where you screw literally everything up.
134055,142864,@AmericanAir u lost jacobs guitar..

134184,142998,@AmericanAir Why didn't you merge accounts when you switched US Airways to AAdvantage? Now I have two AAdvantage numbers.
134198,143012,@AlaskaAir On LAX-SEA. some FA crews get to drink service as soon as we reach cruise. others wait until midflight even w/o turbulence. Why?

134367,143184,@SouthwestAir I booked a flight yesterday but never received a confirmation email. should I be worried?
134370,143188,First time flying @SouthwestAir in about 15 years. First time my bag has been broken by an airline ever. _
134380,143199,@AmericanAir Did so; unable to assist. Not their fault. Pls fwd to tech integration team as a use case. Won't fly US operated in meantime
134395,143214,That's awesome @VirginAmerica straight up cancelled my flight to New York. Amazing guys.
134397,143216,Wheels up! SFO -&gt; LAX on @VirginAmerica   sad the weekend is over :(
134419,143238,Welp. Flights cancelled. Thanks for that @VirginAmerica.
134422,143242,@AmericanAir  Same issue still persisting today - 4 days later.
134435,143256,@united It's not Chris Roberts' fault you have poor in-flight security.
134438,143260,"Volunteer your seat? $300 @united pulls you? $150  What I heard. ""If you inconvenience yourself. $300. If we inconvenience you. $150"
134442,143264,@AmericanAir when is flight 84 from BOS going to leave? We've been waiting for an update.
134454,143276,Hey @DeltaAssist. why was flight 5402 to Laguardia cancelled? Now stuck in Savannah and need to return to NYC today. Pls advise.
134459,143282,@united you delete the link? I don't see it any longer?
134480,143303,@AmericanAir held at the gate at #EWR. Coming up to an hour wait. Connection time at #PHX getting shorter...#nailbiter
134487,143312,@DeltaAssist what is the issue at the Delta check-in at Chicago O'Hare airport? The line has not moved for 15 minutes?
134489,143314,@DeltaAssist trying to move seat beside wife on flt tomorrow from San Juan. 800 Gold number not working currently
134490,143315,@DeltaAssist Delta needs to reevaluate their partnership with #Hertz. I've never been treated so poorly as I have today with #Hertz
134491,143316,@DeltaAssist you just cancelled my flight to JFK that connects to Zurich tonight. Tried to call and have a 51 minute wait. Really?!
134493,143318,@JetBlue. while having my flight delayed was a real bummer. your employees and staff were phenomenal. Thank you to the JetBlue team!
134494,143319,@AmericanAir  your platinum desk is worthless.
134495,143320,Wait I'm getting it now! Like a non stop flight! Can I get a #nonstoppable flight to Hawaii now. @JetBlue? #MarathonMonday
134502,143327,15 minute call hold wait time for AAdvantage Executive Platinum @AmericanAir? Why so busy?
134505,143330,@united hmmmm why would you switch ppls seats around from their own selection? #neveragain #heated ________
134506,143331,Thanks to the incredibly nice JC at #TampaInternationalAirport &amp; @JetBlue for helping get us home to #LoganAirport after a cancelled flight!
134510,143335,@JetBlue if your flight is delayed at online check in should you proceed to the airport for the new scheduled time or the original? Thanks
134512,143337,@DeltaAssist Website won't let me save my passport to my profile. Which of your hundreds of numbers do I call? Last call said 43 min wait!
134513,143338,@DeltaAssist how long is the average phone wait for assistance? Trying to move a flight and have been on hold for 22 min.
134515,143340,@united YOURE KILLING ME http://t.co/4SoBsE9lP3
134517,143343,@AmericanAir you moved me to aa miles and now can't upgrade using miles because flight is US Air. Time to switch airlines.
134520,143346,Words can't even describe how much I hate @united airlines.
134522,143348,@AlaskaAir  TY 4 the amazing travel experience. U spoil us and made other airways seem worse than b4! Can't wait to travel w/u again!
134524,143350,@SouthwestAir is the best I arrived late for my flight literally next to last to board and my luggage made it despite the late check in
134525,143351,Someone remind me why I pay @united almost half a grand a year to wait in lines so I can... https://t.co/F86b8tqmCS http://t.co/x4KZlGS4O3
134526,143353,@AmericanAir trying to cancel flight. but call lines full. automatic hang up. What can I do?
134528,143355,@DeltaAssist I need help fixing this issue on your website... Any Suggestions? http://t.co/bT8ckfXVBI
134534,143361,@AmericanAir charges to use your own flyer miles AND for inflight entertainment. Way to be low and stingy. #travel #traveltips
134535,143362,Same airline(s). almost identical problems and responses for me in LA last December. Never again @AmericanAir  https://t.co/l5lsXS14ZM
134550,143377,Hurry up May 31st. Can't wait to escape California again. Hawaii was the best escape. Looking forward to flying with @AlaskaAir soon!
134566,143396,Up since 3am to travel to see my boy. Bad weather in NY = major delays. Even with that @JetBlue has been amazing.  #stuckatJFK
134573,143403,@DeltaAssist we are 3 days out from travel and my husband is gold status and it's still not allowing up access to switch to economy comfort
134574,143404,Wow.@SouthwestAir has the most mellow hold music. Especially on a Monday morning. it's enough to put you to sleep while you wait.
134578,143410,@united Change the wording on your confirmation email. I'm stuck in Honolulu for 9 hours since I thought I needed 30 minutes to check a bag.
134580,143412,@virginamerica is probably my favorite airline right now. I call them Coachella on a plane! My flight was delayed. but it was cool.
134588,143420,@JetBlue what's the deal with flight 930 from Fort Myers to JFK? Hearing it's cancelled what are my options?
134589,143421,@DeltaAssist first world problems but holy shit your restrooms at LAX sky club 56...there's a LINE?!
134591,143423,@JetBlue we have lost a whole day in NYC FOR A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY. How are you going to compensate us? #yousuck
134596,143428,Really @JetBlue delayed? And no time for departure? #flight409 #notfun specially when traveling with a pet.
134597,143429,@DeltaAssist I'm on DL6425 waiting for gate at LAX; am I going to miss my DL5719 connection?
134653,143486,@JetBlue how long does it take to get my cruise points credited to TRUEBLUE?Tried to call but the wait is 15 minutes for a representative.
134663,143496,Every flt 4 past month has been delayed-leaving. arriving-Thank God 4 time between flts-Feel bad 4 those w/tight connections. @AmericanAir
134664,143497,Hey @JetBlue why did you edit around the girls kiss scene in 'Birdman'? Hetero kissing. illegal drugs &amp; attempted  suicide are ok though?
134684,143519,@DeltaAssist forgot my kindle on your plane and filed a claim but no response...
134686,143521,Fly the unfriendly skies @united. Boarding process is a mess &amp; not streamlined #antifamilyairline #neverflyunited
134688,143524,@AmericanAir Why is it ok for a Captain on US Airways flight #2183 to make a decision to leave 12 passengers stranded at KIAD last night?
134693,143529,I always praise @SouthwestAir but after the shady marketing practices they just did. I'm not sure I want to fly them again. So upset!
134699,143535,@DeltaAssist my best friend got his flight changed out of nowhere! Going to miss his connection flight :/ got a 50min line for CS -_-
134706,143542,A baggage handler trapped in the cargo hold of an @AlaskaAir jet after falling asleep has been banned from all future work at the airline.
134708,143544,@united Please cancel flight ua1666 so I can stay in New York 
134714,143551,I will never in The rest of my existence fly @JetBlue again. I used to love this airline and would always make it my first choice. NO MORE!
134715,143552,Sad I can't fly @VirginAmerica to STL :(
134718,143555,"@united IT systems suck. Reserved exit row seat since booking and when I board they have ""no record"" of seat despite it showing on BP"
134729,143566,@DeltaAssist  Flight DL1579 to DTW delayed b/c of mechanical difficulties until 9pm!! I had work tonight! Now what am I supposed to do?!
134732,143569,Lesson: don't point out possible problems with @United security if you plan to fly with them.   http://t.co/Sma6CDBQRG
134733,143570,"@AmericanAir language around today's delay is disingenuous. come out &amp; say ""delayed another 90m and we are sorry"". Most of us r not 3y old"
134737,143574,@AmericanAir For our lost day in Italy. two missed connections and $410 we received a non-personal form response from AA. That's your best?
134745,143583,Sure @JetBlue cancel my flight and put me on a standby. Is not like I wanna actually get a plane and go
134746,143584,@united whatever is going on at IAD for flights to TN - you guys are really handing the coordination and communications badly.
134768,143607,@DeltaAssist Can I request a GF meal on FlyDelta app? Wait time on hold is 52 min.
134772,143611,@JetBlue Your only other flight to LA leaves 2.5 hours later. My ride no longer can pick me up after midnight. So that does me no good
134778,143617,@SouthwestAir will my flight be a direct flight tomorrow (4/21) or is there a stop? If there is a stop. is here a plane switch? Also. is
134781,143621,@DeltaAssist second trip in a month where we are delayed again out of LAX...
134782,143622,@united My first name on my boarding pass is spelled wrong. Would that give me issues in checking in. if so how do I change it?
134790,143630,@AmericanAir I'm going to miss my connecting in ORD and your 800 number is telling me to call later. Please help ASAP
134793,143633,@SouthwestAir for the amount of money my corporate office spends with southwest each year. it's insane to want $274 more for an open seat.
134796,143636,OMG! @AmericanAir is at it again! How can1 airline continually screw up so often?
134809,143652,@AlaskaAir VERY quick status match. Can't wait to use the benefits on my next flight.
134810,143653,Newark airport operator. the PANYNJ. pushes FAA to throw out @united complaint (subscriber): http://t.co/7HYL0BuoF2

134815,143658,Same problems with @AmericanAir different day.
134822,143665,Why me? @JetBlue I am not happy with you today.
134831,143674,@united Things like this is why your ratings are so bad https://t.co/GRNx2PNZQQ
134833,143676,".@VirginAmerica sent me a $25 flight compensation credit for an ""unpleasant experience"" I never had. #VirginAmerica They spoil me! #Pleasant"
134839,143682,@SouthwestAir receives devaluation. begging the question: Just how bad is it? http://t.co/QGoqvuth24 http://t.co/eRWqw94k2u
134840,143683,@united at airport only to discover our flight from IAH to London on first class was cancelled! Yikes!
134853,143696,@JetBlue thank you so much for wasting my afternoon. #delayedinvegas
134859,143703,@AmericanAir your nonrefundable Advantage mile policy is ridiculous when you no longer need the miles.
134860,143704,@DeltaAssist Still waiting.........
134862,143706,And so we arrive to America w DELAYS beyond DELAYS in Ft. Lauderdale... Anxiously awaiting for @JetBlue to whisk us to NYC #itsjustdrizzling

134955,143806,My 2-city trip was supposed to involve 6 flights. Ended up being 9 flights. Only 2 of the 9 took off w/o a hitch. Never flying @united again

134970,143821,Thanks for delaying my flight 3 times before canceling it and make me wait at the airport for no reason !!! @JetBlue
134976,143827,I frequently read about awful service with airlines on here.  Just wanted to say @JetBlue has been simply awesome since we switched to them.
134997,143848,@JetBlue  flight was supposed to leave at 10am - left at 1pm - took us to Orlando instead of TPA and now stuck on the plane here... ughhh
135013,143865,@JetBlue you can't explain why were not boarding/no agents at gate to ask ? But your staff can text on Tarmac? http://t.co/Es2JaKPP15
135045,143899,@AmericanAir -- what the heck in OKC? No plane. BS answers ... am I stuck here overnight or not? Merger = sad day for travel. Frustrated.

135256,144123,Wow. @jetblue just sent me my password in plaintext in an email after refunding a ticket. Terrible password security.

135281,144150,@SouthwestAir No Fly By lane option at PVD? Premium flyers have to wait in huge line at 4:30 am? http://t.co/V59zbdBtLa
135282,144151,@DeltaAssist very disappointed! Turns out we are actually flying with #virgin airlines and no note or arrangements were made for us!
135284,144153,@DeltaAssist What's the reason the two Delta flights (043 &amp; 081) have a delay today? I have the same flight (043) tomorrow :-)
135290,144160,This is exactly why I never fly @SouthwestAir #NeverAgain
135291,144161,"@SouthwestAir the only two times I've had to sleep on an airport floor was on your airline. Let's hope ""weather"" also means fixing the issue"
135292,144162,@DeltaAssist flight 6200 out of RDU; flight attendant arrives 15mins after boarding time; strolls in; no urgency that everyone kept waiting
135296,144166,@AmericanAir why did you have us take off if the weather was that bad? Stranded in DC.No hotels.You didn't even have red wine on the plane.
135302,144172,@JetBlue timeliness. great employees. SNACKS. free checked bag. tons of comfort. and TV! Only thing was no wifi  otherwise great!
135307,144177,@JetBlue Crew member at JFK. Calvin. was very helpful getting me sorted out last night after connecting flight to RSW cancelled. Thank you.
135308,144178,@SouthwestAir No claim filed. Really just like you guys to throw a plastic tarp over the luggage if you have to leave them outside.
135311,144181,@united cannot wait to book my honeymoon flights on Thurs when you release 25th March 2016 for our final flight home!
135312,144182,@JetBlue my flight #881 is delayed. Any idea what flight # the plane coming in is so I can track it ? I'm bored with time to kill lol
135326,144196,@SouthwestAir I am amazed as to how bad of an airline you are
135332,144202,@JetBlue to add to yesterday's debacle it's now come to light you have damaged my wheelchair.  It in turn has injured my partner
135334,144204,@united Almost ruined my travel plab today.
135350,144220,@DeltaAssist What happened with my reservation? Now I'm missing my connection flight from JFK to NRT.
135359,144230,Horrible phone call with @SouthwestAir this morning trying to check in after errors online :(((( bad start to my trip
135366,144237,.@AmericanAir cancelled flight &amp; understaffed gates. not the best start to travel day.  yinz need to get ppl to their dest better than this.

135384,144257,Remind  me why I continue to use this undependable airline @united . 50k miles this year. almost all late . useless http://t.co/ipKuxntWFd
135396,144269,Worse airline for vouchers is @AmericanAir $25 voucher bc they forgot to put baggage on the flight bc they wanted to leave early.
135399,144272,@JetBlue First flight cancelled. second delayed. lost a day of vacation.  Thanks Jet Blue!
135406,144279,Why did I just find out that @VirginAmerica no longer flies to and from Philly? So sad.. _

137264,146239,@DeltaAssist volunteering to give up my seat is ok.  Having to wait until the flight leaves. then having to wait for vouchers is cruel.
137269,146245,"@AmericanAir ""The flight(s) or fare selected is no longer available. Please modify your request."" but the flights are there when I try again"
137275,146252,I miss you guys! Don't fly till Wednesday   @AmericanAir
137276,146253,@AlaskaAir Bad experience tonight. Diverted from DFW to Austin. hour wait before going to gate. then lack of info. Lots of confusion.
137281,146258,I need a reason to fly with you @AmericanAir. Dallas had bad weather. but a 3.5hr day is now a 14hr+ day. Switching gates &amp; excuses all day.

137289,146267,175 passengers on board @SouthwestAir flight from Vegas to Milwaukee diverted to DIA because of pressurization issue. #9news
137298,146277,@VirginAmerica Delay in San Fran so we would've missed our connecting flight to Boston - gate attendant in LV was awesome rebooking us!
137305,146284,@AlaskaAir FAIL http://t.co/IO7m76AXzy
137309,146288,SFO backed up. @VirginAmerica diverted to OAK to refuel and go back to SFO. Missing connecting flight home to IAD tonight. #nothappy 
137320,146299,Thank you @AlaskaAir for getting me drunk for free since your flight was delayed 4 hours
137323,146303,@AmericanAir plz cancel flight 3041! Not worth flying back into a diverted flight. Cancel it and try again tomorrow a.m.
137328,146309,@VirginAmerica should come up with a cool way of refunding all people below 30 who are stuck at the airport on a Friday night. Just cruel.
137330,146311,Turbulence may be ahead. See why @AmericanAir Forex did worse than expected. http://t.co/0c1G68oEMX #SmartTrader http://t.co/nFAsrBzNwT
137345,146328,Flew @VirginAmerica for the first time tonight - a little disappointed by the experience as my seat headphone jack did not work.
137346,146329,@SouthwestAir flight diverted after reporting pressurization issues. passengers evaluated http://t.co/j25xoH1z3k
137370,146353,@VirginAmerica I lost iPod nano on flt 295. seat 6F.  Help!
137378,146361,@AlaskaAir You guys delayed my flight which makes me miss my 1st presentation at a marriage conference in the am. I was depended on yall._
137381,146364,@AmericanAir AA41 delays 200+ people for 1 hour because 3 forgot passports. Why not 3 guilty wait at ORD not 200 innocent wait at CDG?!
137385,146369,About to spend the next 10 hrs transporting (via @united) an almost 3 yr old and a 7 m old from GRR to SEA. Here we go...
137390,146374,Watching the sunrise on a red eye flight never gets old. #travel #lifeperks @JetBlue
137393,146377,Off to sunny FLA! @JetBlue take me away!! (Really missing Mosaic status!)
137394,146378,Sorry @JetBlue Boston for taking out the stress of traveling with kids on the nice lady who asked for our boarding pass
137397,146381,@DeltaAssist App bug for trying to view seat maps on booked itineraries. Didn't have problem till latest update. last download on 4/21
137405,146389,dissapointed - two delayed flights. due to mechanical and human errors...need to improve @united #getmehome #sad1k http://t.co/a9Fo4ShHae
137407,146391,BOS &gt; MCO ... No egg salad sandwich guy today. but kid next to me smells like Cheerios. Thx for the lift @JetBlue #TrueBlue #mosaic
137410,146394,@DeltaAssist G4SWDT.  Need to be in Orlando before 2PM or our cruise goes down the toilet ;_;  We're hoping ATL lets us leave PNS soon.
137420,146404,1/2 @united UA1266 departs SFO 90 mins late. I run to UA5683 but u close door 10 min early in my face. You didn't know I was coming? #fail
137429,146413,I'm not sure I've ever left on time with @United. Bad luck? Maybe. Missed my connecting flight? Before my first flight took off.
137446,146430,@AmericanAir My golf travel bag was ruined after checking it on my flight.  What is my recourse? http://t.co/nheEaA15EK
137448,146432,Stuck on an airplane - story of my life. @united #thunderstorms
137449,146433,This @JetBlue plane smells like solder #RatherBeSoldering
137451,146435,Sad to see that I'm on an @AlaskaAir flight that's not upgraded. I can't charge my phone 
137455,146440,@AmericanAir if you cancel a flight you owe us CASH under Reg (EC) 261/2004. Don't send us vouchers. AA REF1-3330246903
137457,146442,@DeltaAssist hi delta. I'm missing sky miles from the return leg of my journey. Who should I contact?
137461,146446,Really @JetBlue? We're waiting on our plane when we should've left at 6 bc you're still working on paperwork that was to be done last night?
137475,146461,@JetBlue yes. the error message is email failed.
137477,146463,@AmericanAir cancelled our flight so we're stuck in Boston and missed our cruise #retirement #dissapointed
137494,146481,@DeltaAssist I know they need time. No problem. They should answer the phone though. Deliver appears to be tomorrow. Off to shop underwear..
137495,146482,#delayed @SouthwestAir - why dont we have a better plan for this? 2 hrs later we're finally underway. Day wasted. http://t.co/XycTNLN9EI
137498,146485,@AlaskaAir never mind. Seems that the watch app was not talking to the phone app
137503,146491,How did @AmericanAir earn record $932M. By keeping high prices despite sharp drop in fuel costs. Killing customers like this Plat-for-Lifer
137510,146499,@united what's going on with you guys? I've had two flights from Houston to OKC this week cancelled. And it's asking me to recheck my bags.
137517,146506,@united Feelings expressed. Wallet will likely follow. Very disappointed.
137521,146510,@united #bad #customerservice #lookingforanewairline
137534,146523,@AmericanAir If we notify you that we'll miss the first leg of a round trip. for reasonable circumstances. will the second leg be cancelled?
137535,146524,@DeltaAssist not yet. still waiting for news...
137545,146534,@JetBlue since when if this your policy. If new its awful and unrealistic
137551,146540,@AmericanAir having one heck of a time trying to book award travel. and your automated system keeps hanging up on me. : (
137556,146545,@VirginAmerica DC flight delayed but Virgin staff Selina was amazing
137560,146549,.@SouthwestAir app not working. #travel
137578,146569,@AmericanAir when normalized the flights to buenos aires and how is your politic for cancel flights?
137579,146570,Two future @AmericanAir pilots in waiting!!  Take me to Cabo please. #beachbound http://t.co/K62QA5PfAF
137581,146572,@AmericanAir Shouldn't weather affect ALL the AA flights? I watched two DFW flights leave as our A/C sat. That's mechanical or crew rest.
137591,146582,Not happy @JetBlue sold my 9-year old's name for direct marketing. Ironically. the first junk mail he gets offers him identity protection.
137592,146583,@united I didn't miss my connecting flight in Vegas. So. it was a triumph of sorts.
137599,146591,@JetBlue in classic Jet Blue fun style they announce the arrival of a delayed flight with Rocky theme song. Great way to bring smiles.
137607,146599,@JetBlue been flying with you guys for 11 years almost exclusively. Repulsing you just charged me 150 to cancel a 370 dollar flight.#thanks
137622,146614,@AmericanAir bags lost again! Flying with you all this trip was a disaster. #timetogosouthwest
137626,146618,@JetBlue no tv working on flight from Orlando to Buffalo! Really bad form with so many kids on board. Makes for a bad flying experience!
137627,146619,@united Why must you be so bad at seat assignments? Why? #lastunitedflights
137632,146624,I really hate that @united removed the ability to change your FF number on a reservation online_ agents take 15 minutes to change it..
137637,146630,@AmericanAir I've missed two connections and most of my best friend's wedding because of American Eagle. Please. please. please shut it down
137642,146637,@AmericanAir now that our mechanical delay takes us last 4 pm. can you cater AA1201?
137648,146644,@DeltaAssist I had the worse experience transferring from my wheelchair to my business class seat in my trip from Dubai today dl07.
137654,146650,COLD to not let us through the door when the plane was still there @Americanair 846 clt-dca. Not our fault you overbooked inbound gate.
137655,146651,It continues to amaze me how bad the @SouthwestAir app is. Just got B after it failed me and I had to check in on mobile web
137657,146653,@united can't beleive it. my husband's flight was delayed again. Can you please tell me the reason for this new delay? Flight 821 SFO-MEX
137658,146654,Kudos to the pilots of @SouthwestAir flight 1102 from SLC to Vegas. What. A. Flight. So much turbulence. I hope the next leg isn't bad.
137666,146663,@united today you failed.
137674,146672,lol. #southwest delayed all sorts of flights because of a broken light bulb. @SouthwestAir #swa2783
137675,146673,@AmericanAir hi! I'm on flight 42 to CDG and we have been delayed for a while without any explanation. How much longer until takeoff?
137683,146683,@SouthwestAir Mario. who works at the baggage claim at SAN needs the biggest gold star! Made a stressful situation (missing bag) bearable.
137686,146686,Only bad experiences with @AlaskaAir. Ditching them for Virgin from now on.
137687,146687,@united Any reason the air conditioning is broke on UA#3536?!? #1000degrees #sweatingbullets #whypaytobeuncomfortablelikethis
137705,146709,1st time flying @AmericanAir many yrs. not impressed guys. Hr delay jfk/sea. still waiting to take off. Feels like everything done on cheap
137707,146711,@SouthwestAir can you tell me why flight 2554 from DAL to TPA is delayed?
137712,146716,@DeltaAssist I've been on hold 40 minutes. can you give me a current wait time?
137713,146717,@united Flight 1738 DONT LEAVE US in Houston!!! KDeYoe . Paige and I are HERE!!! 
137715,146719,@united my flight was delayed. my seat didn't recline. the outlet under my seat didn't work. Travel was so uncomfortable.
137721,146725,.@United You don't get to use Rhapsody in Blue in your commercials anymore. It's over.  You're doing an evil evil thing
137729,146734,You could ask @AlaskaAir the same ? No longer having Bible verses on the napkins as to not offend. Supports LGBT??? https://t.co/eDVy9TR92A
137732,146737,Still love the freebie from @AlaskaAir months ago when I was delayed. Such a smart gift. hang out in airports and use their branded charger.
137734,146739,Missed 2nd flight today. 1st to turning back midway to turn off stove.  2nd to retrieve laptop left at restaurant. @SouthwestAir #badday
137735,146740,Thankfully @AmericanAir found my iPad! Glad I took the time to call Lost &amp; Found.
137736,146741,HUGE THX to JFK @jetblue gate agent Juan S for returning my unknowingly lost wallet moments before my flight to BOS took off! #hero _
137746,146754,@DeltaAssist do I get my air miles back if cancel a flight booked on air miles?
137747,146755,@united inconvenience of your airline. Misinformation we not flying with you guys anymore
137762,146770,Who is going to disrupt airline travel? Additional $1200 (2 ppl) to remove a leg from an upcoming trip is INSANE. #travel #flying @united
137783,146791,I really hope @jetblue doesn't delay us from flying because of name misspellings ! Particularly as we are traveling w/ a deceased love one.
137792,146801,.@united this was served in first class on flight 1041 this evening. Looked like caramelized bubblegum. tasted worse. http://t.co/ObEZf6B8cV
137797,146806,@AmericanAir I can't afford to wait that long. How can I speed up the process. This is not my fault. this is the negligence of your staff.
137800,146809,Driving around BWI because @SouthwestAir lost my sister's bags &amp; told her not to leave. She has her baby w/her. SMH http://t.co/LX8tXJJo9l
137805,146814,You guys probably have the shittiest airline service in the world. @AmericanAir
137825,146834,Really hope @SouthwestAir doesn't take ages to get a native app on the Apple Watch. They were already late to the Passbook game.
137828,146837,@JetBlue so far it's a home run. Okay. It's 4AM. I'm out of bad humor. :)
137830,146840,@AmericanAir I'm going to miss my connecting flight from JFK to YUL. I have school tomorrow!! Anyway you can help? :(
137840,146850,@AmericanAir  trying to get home. Ride to CHA the plane was leaking on me.  going home ATX plane not working #delay http://t.co/RZMI1JcgZl
137844,146854,@united you guys fail doing the whole group thing to board the plane
137847,146857,@AlaskaAir I was premature with my praise earlier this week.  Your #custserv agents this morning were beyond NON-helpful.  #Disappointed
137853,146863,@JetBlue the JFK lost and found number is impossible to reach. Left my ipad in my seat on my flight this morning. Would like to address...
137859,146869,@JetBlue issues were resolved easily this morning. The customer service this morning was excellent
137871,146883,@AmericanAir flt70 to DFW. Tell ur flt attndnts if they're unhappy. there are other jobs out there. No need to take it out on cstmrs. 
137873,146885,@AmericanAir hi! Is there a lost property number as I left my beats headphones on plane just realised I don't have them _
137894,146907,@americanair I'm not sure you do. I expected this refund issued the day your airline took my money and then caused me to miss a connection.
137900,146913,@AmericanAir why isn't your app working?? I can't check in online and I'm going to miss my flight if I can't http://t.co/kJOrSS7WNp
137906,146919,@VirginAmerica u my trap queen
137912,146925,Still hate the new food services at #EWR. it's very unfriendly and not to say a huge #germ source! Time to leave @united for another?
137916,146930,@DeltaAssist need ur help  item left on ystrdy flt 4947 needed badly cannot reach MSP desk? can u call 501-258-5030 please
137935,146949,@DeltaAssist made it home from EYW to SFO. Bag missed my flight. Bag showed at my house w irreparable handle. What happens now?
137937,146951,@VirginAmerica your edm/hold/take off music is really really really. really really bad. like the default alarm in my 1st flip phone.
137951,146966,@united you rebooked me on American much later and I missed a meeting. And $125 for a 9lb bag overage is insane. since 2 25lb bags is $50
137952,146967,@DeltaAssist why on earth would you board the plane 25 minutes early. just to make us sit in there wait to takeoff an hour+ later. #notcomfy
137954,146969,@AlaskaAir Can I check in/check my bags at IAH. or do I have to wait 3 more hours?
137957,146972,@united - no entertainment anywhere on plane EWR-SFO today?  Really bad. Lots of frustrated customers. This 1Ker too.
137962,146978,@AlaskaAir   Can't wait...
137971,146988,Shoutout to @AmericanAir for not killing me even with these awful flying conditions. http://t.co/1eF5Kxm4pw
137977,146994,@united My friend had to cancel her international flight due to a medical emergency. Is it possible to have the $600 change fee waived?
137978,146995,Nooooo the AC on the plane broke. @AmericanAir
137992,147009,@DeltaAssist this flight 1312 from Boston to Detroit smells like vomit. This is what happens with a 5 min cleaning job. So gross!
137995,147012,Big fail. @AlaskaAir - sick husband stuck at PDX with huge delays and broken plane. First and last time flying your airline.
137997,147014,@DeltaAssist I hope you're allowing for extra time for 3p ATL departures.  Security lines are ridiculous.
137999,147016,@SouthwestAir why pay $12.50 for early bird when there are still 58 people ahead of me? #worstairline #rudepeople #scam #ripoff
138003,147020,@DeltaAssist yesterday my delta flight 695 from belize city was late result =missed flight 1684 from ATL-SJC. been stuck in ATL since then
138005,147022,@AmericanAir US Airways. bet you don't even read the bad reviews. let alone the complaints emailed to you https://t.co/NhkBCjuksC
138008,147025,"@united Always a slap to the face when reps say ""it happens"" and a company won't rectify significant baggage damage. http://t.co/18VizuR3WG"
138009,147026,@VirginAmerica I wanted to check a bag but I'm not going to wait 45 mins for someone to staff the check in counter!
138010,147027,.@AmericanAir boarding pass on my Apple Watch! :D Can't wait to try this out tomorrow
138011,147028,.@DeltaAssist four flights in 2 days. not a single Economy Plus seat to move into. Looks like Gold Medallion truly is worthless now.
138020,147037,@JetBlue I've never flown with you guys before but I love your super creative pigeon commercials so much that I might try you out soon! _
138026,147043,@DeltaAssist Seat selection tool on the delta app for iPhone no longer works. Is this a known issue?
138059,147078,Angry ppl here in Vegas - TSA pre check agent says @JetBlue  boarding passes don't scan so everyone had to go through regular line
138080,147100,Hey @AlaskaAir what are you serving for lunch in 1st on 561 today? Need to figure out if my lactose intolerance will be an issue
138081,147101,@AmericanAir are you joking? 1h40m on the runway after double boarding #AA206 captain discovered engine problems!
138084,147104,@DeltaAssist maint delay. If other delta flights unavailable will u book on a diff airline
138086,147106,Waiting to board @VirginAmerica 347 in #FLL to #SFO. Looking forward to a great flight!
138097,147117,Flight delayed @united and hoping to connect and be done with flying you. 2 more to go. Wish me luck
138106,147127,Can @United explain why we boarded a plane when we have a missing captain and are looking for a 2nd captain? ORD&gt;MSP
138109,147130,What's the deal @AmericanAir flight 1037. You are making parents wait last for strollers???
138121,147144,@DeltaAssist I am unable to view seat map on my phone for LAX-SYD or my return. Technical problems error for 10 days now. Assistance?
138132,147155,@DeltaAssist will I make the ATL to ORF that departs at 8. I'm still in BNA waiting for 2176
138136,147162,@AmericanAir You have 10 mins to cancel your next flight or i will detonate the bomb on your plane
138148,147174,Shady! The $50 I saved on my @VirginAmerica flight by signing up for their credit card negated by $49 join fee. #bullshit
138152,147179,@AmericanAir could cut legroom another 3 inches and not do perm damage to pax knees. 738s to 172 pax. Max S/H value! http://t.co/ze4Otw4Pyy
138165,147193,@united can you please help us get on a frontier flight tonight? Mechanical problems and need to arrive tonight
138171,147200,24 channels are bad enough. @VirginAmerica. but 6 are unwatchable and 1 is broken. That leaves 17. #firstworldproblems
138173,147202,@AmericanAir anyone reporting issues with iOS app not updating? Four hours now. Logged in and out about to reinstall
138174,147203,@SouthwestAir any info on 716 why status shows on time dep but delayed arrival of 1:25?
138176,147205,I hate you so much @AmericanAir
138178,147208,@DeltaAssist the seat map no longer works in the Delta app!
138179,147209,I've never flown @JetBlue before. but the individual tvs and free wifi is pretty awesome.
138182,147212,Made it to #chile. I was on one of the first @AmericanAir flights to leave for Chile since volcano #Calbuco blew. http://t.co/lUKRhNgnt9
138200,147230,Delayed for a coffee machine on @AmericanAir just what I needed for a 30 minute flight. #getmehome
138202,147232,. @united flight 514 delayed 2x and then tells us AS WE'RE BOARDING THE PLANE that the direct is now stopping in Chicago. Sure why not?
138231,147263,SarahSilverman: @AmericanAir she told me I could fill out a claim but AA doesn't cover missing wheels on domes... http://t.co/rYNcH7VjON
138234,147266,Don't buy United Airlines tickets as they will cancel them without refund if you are a security researcher https://t.co/T9RpVfLCVg @united
138238,147270,@SouthwestAir Just booked my first flight with you guys ! Can't wait for September #dallas #southwest
138250,147283,I hate you. @AmericanAir
138252,147285,A bad judgement of @AmericanAir not flying to EZE is keeping people hostage in an airport.They don't care.they do nothing.Scary impunity
138264,147298,Hi @VirginAmerica . any way to expedite the status match on my account? Waiting to book some flights. sent in screenshots already. can DM.
138267,147301,@VirginAmerica gate agent Michelle at SEA is awesome! Saved the day and got me on a last minute flight home. despite shitty Virgin IT.
138271,147305,Come on @AmericanAir. get us on the ground before these storms roll in! I have faith in this S80! -#TexasWeather  feeling stressed
138273,147307,@AmericanAir Traveling tomorrow and name is inverted on boarding pass. Middle name shown as part of last name. Is this a problem?
138289,147324,@AmericanAir No response to Tweet yesterday?? #lame If u make a policy change on FAA approved devices at least tell staff WHY. #caresharness
138291,147326,@AmericanAir stuck in Shreveport with no chance of getting to final destination today or tomorrow on American???? Expecting compensation.
138293,147328,When @SouthwestAir screws your friends...
138294,147329,@VirginAmerica What's with dropping all directs from FLL to SFO and back? 340. 345. 346 &amp; 347 were always full &amp; best commute to work. #fail
138296,147332,Rather fly a pack of gum with duct taped wings then fly @united. No such thing as fashionably late with airlines. You're 10ply. bud.
138298,147334,I've sworn by &amp; booked exclusively though @JetBlue for 7 years until now. Officially the worst airline. Thx for taking my money &amp; not caring
138300,147336,@AmericanAir why didn't they give us a voucher? We got stuck at lag tonight after they cancelled flight w no notice.
138301,147337,@JetBlue heck YES! You are my fave carrier. Been a travel agent for 9 yrs. know who to pick :)
138304,147340,"@AmericanAir ""unusual"" lol. That's ILLEGAL. i.e.. you are req'd to go over safety procedures of you air craft. You don't=violation"
138306,147342,1/2 delayed flight out of #SanDiego puts us missing our connector home. Would of been delayed at #Seattle for 8 hours. Thanks to @AlaskaAir
138309,147345,@DeltaAssist are you guys having trouble with website?? Can't book hotels - keep getting error msg after error msg 30 min wait for Cus Serv
138311,147347,Disappointed to learn of @AlaskaAir cuts to direct service from Bellingham to Vegas. Flying 2-3 times a year and flights always full.
138323,147359,@JetBlue You need to hurry up and extend your dates! The anticipation is killing me 
138330,147368,Flight is supposed to board at 8:40 and leave at 9:10 in PHX for SJC. but we haven't boarded yet. What the hell @SouthwestAir??
138331,147369,@americanair I've tried. First time I got transferred back to a 15+ minute wait on hold. Second time I got disconnected (after waiting).
138339,147378,@AmericanAir  I was flying from Dallas to Des Moines in the flight 1071 tonight. I lost my passport inside the plane. who should I contact?
138341,147380,@AmericanAir 's poor management has left my stranded at MIA with our dogs.
138342,147382,@AmericanAir I hate you so much.
138343,147383,I flew @AlaskaAir to a wedding his weekend. Hate to fly a different airline back.  If I have a choice.... It's Alaska every time.
138352,147392,I hate @AmericanAir so much. it's not even funny.
138359,147400,After I'm done with these @united sky miles I'm done with them. Ridiculous service/usage. #BlackoutDatesForDays #FeesForDays
138367,147409,"@united flight cancelled due to ""crew availability"" .... incrementally better then just looking at me and saying ""meh"""
138382,147426,Worlds longest flight sfo to Dallas via Abilene 7 1/2 hours later plus a missed landing. Thanks a lot @VirginAmerica that was intense
138391,147435,45 mins trapped on flt 912. Jet bridge no power! Connnections in MIA? Come on @AmericanAir
138398,147443,@deltaassist Fly Delta app lists wrong terminal for LHR-&gt;ATL. Says T3. but is actually T4. Hoping not to miss the flight.
138405,147451,@DeltaAssist where is the lost &amp; found at Dallas Lovefield?
138423,147469,And you wonder why I hate @SouthwestAir . not one time flying with then has my flight left on time.
138427,147473,I only fly @VirginAmerica if they're going where I'm going. but getting hit with a $75 fee for a 55 pound bag is total bullshit. #justsayin
138428,147474,Why is Mesa airlines always delayed? @AmericanAir
138429,147475,@SouthwestAir your PHL checkin crew just handled an unreasonable customer with ease! It's too early to be that angry lol. LUV SWA
138431,147477,@AmericanAir where can I file a formal complaint? Too much for Twitter. The agent also lied to My face and now Im out a $20 crescent wrench
138467,147515,I have the @VirginAmerica flight video song stuck in my head and we haven't even taken off yet  #LAtoSF #flysafe
138473,147521,@DeltaAssist - see attached picture - luggage stuck on ramp at Logan - longer than 20 minute wait http://t.co/M4j6awy5aY
138476,147524,@AlaskaAir flight delayed but no status update.  AS685 DEN-SEA
138487,147536,@VirginAmerica I love you. but I probably won__t take the first class upgrades any longer. At $399 the value just isn__t there for me.
138491,147540,@americanair Hi there. Never really heard back. but you did not find me more legroom or switch my seat back. Did you issue a refund?
138495,147546,Flying @SouthwestAir for 1st time in a while! What's the protocol on holding seats for others and telling ppl it's taken? Questionable behav
138521,147572,Not happy with overbooking and middle seat AGAIN! C'mon @AlaskaAir. I thought you were better!
138530,147582,Very disappointed in the new @AmericanAir for not allowing me to use my last US Airways companion pass. Gold Member status means nothing.
138537,147589,YOU HAVE SOMEHOW CONTINUE TO RUIN MY BIRTHDAY @AMERICANAIR!!
138551,147603,Is it just me or is the GoGoInflight wifi on @alaskaair Flight30 to Boston painfully slow today? Normally much better throughput.
138560,147613,.@AlaskaAir has delayed me exactly once in 6 yrs of increasingly frequent flying &amp; gave everyone $100 future discount unprompted. Y'all rock
138562,147617,Flew @VirginAmerica for the first time on my way to San Diego. Can't say that it was bad at all. Very nice experience.
138567,147623,@united I'm going to need a later trip ORD-IND; now delayed 0:50 and increasing
138570,147626,@united you and your overbooking flights are ruining people's lives
138585,147644,@AmericanAir you managed to screw things up today. too. At least you're consistent.
138588,147647,But @JetBlue clearly loves me because they held up the entire flight waiting for me to get on the plane hahaha. AMAZING.
138591,147651,@JetBlue how about a mint upgrade if abailable for this flight otherwise you've just left the worst taste inmy mouth forever
138594,147654,We're on the flight with @AmericanAir but I'm not going to relax until they shut the door since they're kicking people off the plane.
138597,147657,@AmericanAir you no longer have any direct flights between SFO and SEA? Really? What happened. Have to now use a different carrier.
138599,147659,Thanks @AlaskaAir for taking care of a problem created by another airline. #aboveandbeyond
138602,147662,@AmericanAir Any clue what's going on with AA1424 LAX-LAS? That's my inbound plane and seems to be a rolling delay.
138614,147674,@united Ironic this link http://t.co/8oXcopQhyD is broken http://t.co/vnEpn0DwtK
138615,147675,Too bad @AmericanAir isn't going to honor all the emails they sent my friend. Now she's out $400 and they won't answer her.
138621,147681,Does @AmericanAir even try to be on time?  Stuck in Miami.  #shouldhaveflownjetblue
138623,147683,@JetBlue Can't wait!  Side note: Currently researching your social media stats and thus far you prove your customer service to be true
138632,147692,It makes more sense to board passengers on planes back to front. We just stand in the aisle waiting for people to put bags away. @AlaskaAir
138634,147694,2015: @JetBlue's website doesn't work. This will cost me over $200 to CANCEL a $35 flight. http://t.co/HQpg26SIQs http://t.co/xtg03uQGbd

138666,147729,@united No. We didn't realize the full extent of the damage until the shuttle dropped us back at our car. By then it was too late.
138675,147738,@DeltaAssist can you make it easier to book flights in app? No way to clear out previous searches if switching destinations
138678,147741,The universe noticed I had a wonderful weekend. then decided that was too much goodness for me. Cue the canceled &amp; delayed flightS @JetBlue
138679,147743,really don't understand how there are no @JetBlue flights going from cancun to the states tonight
138693,147760,What makes for a bad day? Having a first happen @SouthwestAir loses your bag and nobody can tell you where it is.

139263,148365,Wonder how much @AmericanAir lost over their ipad app crash to offset the supposed $1.2M they thought they would save on 'paperwork'?

139271,148373,Record locators R apparently a waste with @AmericanAir they will just lose your bag and that's it.  Then expect you to have copies of tix
139273,148375,I am so tired of being treated poorly by @AmericanAir. I try to avoid their flights and stick to US Airways. but sometimes that doesn't work
139275,148377,@AmericanAir I__ve been trying to claim missing miles for a flight I took back in March. Haven__t heard back in a bit. Can you assist?

139368,148481,new level of absurd fees by #airlines : @JetBlue wants to charge me $100 to cancel a confirmed ticket. Not to rebook. just to cancel.
139370,148483,@SouthwestAir why is flight #512 out of Vegas delayed? Some people take the early flights for a reason!!!

139422,148538,@JetBlue Yes. I would like to know why there's last minute pilots switch out for the plane from LBG to AUS. It was supposed to depart 11:30
139455,148575,Hey @DeltaAssist I'm on flight 132 DTW-&gt;AMS and there's some issue with the APU. Least you guys could do is get us some beer.

139502,148624,@SouthwestAir late again. Now waiting on 852 out of New Orleans. Fully anticipate now getting stranded in Baltimore tonight.
139503,148625,God. I forgot how much I hate flying @SouthwestAir
139504,148626,The only negative so far with changing to @AmericanAir is the small planes and lost time with gate checks. Still worth the switch so far.
139505,148627,@AmericanAir You're off to a poor start. You could not have a made a worse first impression. I mean. not without killing everyone on board.
139516,148638,Plane is leaving late as usual. Going to miss my connecting flight as usual. @AmericanAir
139517,148639,@AmericanAir my mom also lost her glasses. we are hoping you could help us out.
139526,148648,@united Are connections alerted when earlier flight delayed?  Tight one now to make globalfirst IAD DXB

139542,148665,@SouthwestAir DTW-BWI works and so does BWI-NAS. But DTW-NAS is broken.
139544,148668,Really @united? EWR to LAX on new plane with no tv? Does Direct TV have a future on the airline?

139564,148689,@DeltaAssist disappointed with the apology email from delta for cancel flight DL3669 last week!!!!
139569,148694,@DeltaAssist Can you say how much longer flight 2605 will be delayed?
139572,148697,hey @united - 2 of 6 planes i've taken this week had internet issues.  is this normal?  what are you doing to improve connectivity?
139573,148698,@jetblue listening to horror stories of the flight from LB-SF due to sched errors. Same thing on Tues. What up?
139590,148715,Tweeting from the air... I'm really glad I've switched to @SouthwestAir
139592,148717,Hiii LA. I've missed you.  @VirginAmerica http://t.co/EuxDzfBA1B
139594,148719,@JetBlue booked a flight home this wkend w/ reward pts as a bday _ for myself BUT I feel flu symptoms kicking in  what are my options?
139601,148726,S/o to the @AmericanAir staff in JFK and Miami they got me where I needed to be on time . It's a shame Pittsburgh folded so bad #hometown
139603,148729,@united why is seat reclining restricted for 15 on UA1695 SEA to EWR..it is just simply cheating by not disclosing
139605,148731,@DeltaAssist done. Considering the ripple effect this has caused in missing meetings tonight to prepare to leave at 4am TOMW - very upset
139607,148733,So. @AmericanAir took my carry-on and sent it down in the cargo hold and when it reaches Barbados my spare cellphone is missing. MIA-BGI
139609,148735,@DeltaAssist QQ: If I book a flight on http://t.co/HjvhmTtnD2 at 12:01 am. do I still get full refund if I cancel before 11:59 pm next day?
139612,148738,.@JetBlue kudos to your capt on #358. Diverted flight for fuel made for some angry passengers. He personally answered everyone's questions.
139618,148744,@JetBlue nothing like waiting 35 minutes for my bag at SLC International. What a joke.
139619,148745,@DeltaAssist Are you experiencing any issues with http://t.co/apnWyF44Kt? I keep unsuccessfully trying to book a ticket...

139650,148777,@AmericanAir AA 4390 is delayed till 9:45 am. Any chance it will leave earlier? I'm debating if I should go to the airport  now or wait.
139654,148781,@AmericanAir is not at fault but Laguardia NYC terminal C made itself more inhospitable by shutting only coffee shop. A new low.
139657,148784,At the airport waiting to board my @AmericanAir flight to #LosAngeles for a #girls-weekend!! #cantwaittoseeyou

139689,148818,@AmericanAir . taking away #props. Major delay on return flight due to mech issue. Will prob miss conx and son's school performance.
139690,148819,For a low-budget airline. @JetBlue has a great customer service. for delayed flights. I'm $25 up!
139692,148822,Disappointed that @AmericanAir won't have a #vegan dinner option in first class on my flight this weekend. Maybe next time.
139700,148830,@SouthwestAir purchased a ticket for $198 used a $20 voucher. Paid the difference $177. Now I am told the voucher expires on 5/19 so I lost
139701,148831,@AmericanAir Sorry they did not. My issue was not resolved. I will either have this linger or just have people not use your company.
139713,148844,@AmericanAir That's not the issue. The seat fee and all other fees dont excuse rudeness. this tweet is out of touch of my needs.
139718,148849,@AlaskaAir is on a roll this week! Can't wait to take my first trip to Costa Rica!
139719,148850,Can't wait to get on that @SouthwestAir flight tomorrow and start our Honeymoon!!
139722,148854,@AlaskaAir awesome! Can't wait to go back!
139724,148856,@DeltaAssist 2nd flight of the day second mechanical issue. Sitting in ATL pilots providing zero updates. Gold medallion here done w/delta
139726,148860,@SouthwestAir when you cancel a flight (813) don't make the previous one leave the gate early!!!!
139728,148862,@united There's not a problem at the moment. I'm just wondering if we can still get a vegetarian meal on flight 485 today.
139737,148872,.@SouthwestAir Taking family trip today on SWA for the 1st time in years. Your handling of a cxcl due to mechanical problem is laughable
139740,148875,Same day $25 change fee is another reason I love @AlaskaAir. No fare differences. penalties or other nonsense. Thanks!
139742,148878,@AlaskaAir extremely excited about CR prospects - just had the worst trip to CR on US Airways - was missing my #AlaskaAir on that trip!!
139743,148879,So a male flight attendant on @AlaskaAir just decided to make a joke about Baltimore over the intercom. Very poor taste. Not professional.
139746,148882,We have three employees at @AmericanAir ORD that have not missed a day of work in 25 years. and one who hasn't missed in 35 years! #woah
139749,148886,@AlaskaAir a male flight attendant on flight 39. His intent did not seem malicious. but in poor taste in light of recent events.
139752,148889,Seriously!? @JetBlue broke 3zippers. The frame and a few items inside! I always fly this comp. the nyc crew truly dsnt care 4 ur belongings
139762,148900,@JetBlue not your fault. You guys got us there early!
139764,148902,@United Way conference: We wake up every day figuring how to solve community problems. What a privilege.#UWCLC
139774,148912,Poorly handled@JetBlue http://t.co/v01D5FcVAz
139775,148913,@AmericanAir you guys are the worst. Excuse for everything and always claim it's not your fault. #joke
139776,148914,@DeltaAssist three key systems fail in a row on md88 for #dl2527. Maybe time for a new plane?
139784,148922,@AlaskaAir super excited you added #CostaRica I can't wait to #bookmyflight!
139785,148923,@DeltaAssist Sure -- my trip is  G8P7IM. and the 1st leg was VA-Adelaide where it seems bag VA121434 seems to be stuck?  VA121433 showed up
139788,148926,I don't know why @united even has search preferences for flights since it never works. and it selects its own flight time and airport...
139789,148927,Ed also reporting sky is blue and he occasionally has issues with @AmericanAir  https://t.co/HAaXhhSZ1m
139792,148930,@AmericanAir very disappointed with how my dividend miles issue was handled
139796,148935,I don't mind traveling. Been doin it a long time. But 1 thing kills me. When an @united attendant slams the overhead shut next to my ear.
139800,148939,@AlaskaAir can't wait to check it out!! Thanks Alaska!! #alaskaair #CostaRica
139801,148940,Time to add @AmericanAir flight attendants to the list of things I hate about Chicago O'Hare.
139802,148941,A4. Definitely @SouthwestAir. I've got mad LUV for that company. #Luv4Social  https://t.co/oFVP0QAxat

139823,148964,@DeltaAssist yes I certainly plan on doing so very soon. I wanted to gather myself prior to doing. Hopefully this issue can be rectified.
139825,148967,You would think that switching a flight from Saturday to Friday wouldn't cost $513 with @united
139828,148970,My quoted wait time with @AmericanAir was 19-27 minutes. At 39 and still holding now. #servicefail #heydelta
139832,148974,@DeltaAssist is what it is plane broke down...
139842,148984,@DeltaAssist very unhappy with schedule change for #G39MII on 7/11/15. What can you do for me?
139848,148991,Don't check in late with @AmericanAir they will give your PAID first class seat away. #ChampRidingCoachToday #NotCoolAmerican #Shadiness
139852,148995,Also pretty unhappy that @AlaskaAir revokes your hard earned status if you don't travel enough during the year... 
139853,148996,@AmericanAir planes are often outdated yet they charge the same as other carriers. #annoying #Airfare #travel
139854,148997,@united My elderly Mother received a text from your airline saying her flt was delayed 36 min. She missed the flt due to that misinformation
139863,149007,@SouthwestAir oh wait the plain just arrived. Wonder how many people who cut the line and where wheeled in healed in flight and will run off
139865,149009,@united Your FF plan is no longer the best. I was a 1k but I am now focusing on AA as you made it too demanding to even become gold. #fail

139935,149082,@AmericanAir  Still no resolution. Filed a complaint today with the FAA and better business bureau. More actions coming your way
139938,149086,Every time I try to fly @united I am disappointed. Not sure why I give them a shot each time. So much for friendlier skies

139959,149107,@united : leaves early on the flight I want to be on. late on the flight I have to be on. There is a reason I choose not to fly with you.
139965,149113,@AlaskaAir -thank u employee Gil at DCA. made a frustrating delay situation easier w/Ur smile and friendly assistance.

140001,149152,@SouthwestAir this makes 3 flights in a row that are late. What's the deal?
140002,149153,HA! The only thing @united gets done is delaying people for no reason.
140007,149158,@SouthwestAir 2nd time in past month CLE delay caused missed connection  and now won't be home until tomorrow afternoon.
140010,149161,@DeltaAssist On flight 2339 to Atlanta but 20th in line for take off. Will probably miss 1320 to SAV. Is there a later flight?

140020,149172,@SouthwestAir is always apologizing but do nothing to do things better #worstcompany #worstcustomerservice  #dontflysouthwest

141067,150310,@AmericanAir the sad saga continues. Today the ground crew forgot to add the fuel the Capt requested. Thankfully he caught that #dontflyAA
141072,150316,@AlaskaAir please change up the music on your flights. You're making me hate bands I love.
141081,150326,@DeltaAssist my flt is at 4:50 today. Got an email at 3:55 yesterday saying I could check in. Missed upgrade. Why more than 24 hrs out?

141086,150331,@DeltaAssist when is the last flight from ATL to LIT tonight. Current flight is delayed. worried about connecting flight

141122,150368,@jetblue Are you bringing in a new plane for delayed flight 1459 from BDL? Or should I look for other options.
141139,150387,Hey @DeltaAssist. if I have flight credit. do I have to actually fly or can I just apply it within the year of the issue date?! #helpplz
141146,150395,@AmericanAir my twitter-less roommate would like you to please check on the status of complaint ref 1-3353199893
141154,150403,Thanks @JetBlue for being completely unreasonable and unhelpful with a delay at one of your biggest hubs. Never flying again.
141156,150405,737 from @AlaskaAir has nicer seats than 757. But it also smells like a portapotty. and gogoinflight has poor UX. 
141159,150408,@DeltaAssist: flight delayed in Green Bay and will miss connection to BWI. I was rebooked to Dca but can not get a seat assignment. Gold M
141165,150414,Astonished by @united's in-flight meal. How could they screw up basic things like a tray? Incredibly unstable. http://t.co/hNxMVsDrls
141183,150432,@AmericanAir once again screwed by AA. First Class video does not work. They lose birthday gift we checked for our son's party tonight!!
141185,150434,@SouthwestAir  re cancelled flight 849 next time you must cancel have staffer supervise the lines to the counter
141190,150439,In other breaking news. I hate Coach more than ever. No champagne in second class. Won't go get for me. Coach Rage. @AlaskaAir
141191,150440,Anyone got problems with the @united app on Apple Watch? Doesn't want to launch (tried restarting phone/watch/reinstalling app).
141197,150446,@JetBlue I am bummed about the delay flight 6 FLL&gt;EWR why???

141203,150452,"@AmericanAir when are you gonna cut that hemorrhoid ""Envoy"" off. They just don't care. Many missed connections from flt 3162."
141204,150453,Having my first bad experience with @VirginAmerica ____
141215,150465,.@SouthwestAir I made a big mistake today. I flew United to save $40. but now I'm 3 hours late and miserable. Never again.
141220,150470,Not a bad view at all! #Latergram #southwest @southwestair https://t.co/aha9Gj7HrW
141222,150472,@DeltaAssist flight 2202 from Vegas was delayed due to private planes. Is there chances planes will be held?
141223,150473,.@AmericanAir hello what is the best way to go about handling a poorly managed incident at ORD involving OneWorld Sapphire and downgrade ?
141226,150476,Okay @jetblue don't fail me now! BOS_LAX #youcanhaverootsandwings #getbacktomyfuturehubs #ihateflying https://t.co/VJ5sLU9T3D
141237,150488,Heading back home. Let's hope this plane ride isn't as miserable as the one past thurs @AmericanAir
141242,150494,@DeltaAssist Hi! I just noticed my ticket for Tuesday has my last name and middle name all together as one name. Will this cause problems?
141243,150495,@DeltaAssist is there an issue with the website? It won't let me add my skymiles #into a reservation or save my reservation to my profile
141245,150497,@AmericanAir when you schedule flights please make sure you schedule a flight attendant for that flight! It's going to be late enough as is!
141252,150504,. @SouthwestAir flight 2 hr delayed because of traffic flying out of Vegas. I guess they didn't get the memo there was a fight in town....
141257,150509,@SouthwestAir You are killing me with this delay from FLL to BWI.
141258,150510,Delayed flight out of Indianapolis and @SouthwestAir took care of us with $200 vouchers for our trouble. This is why I ONLY fly Southwest!
141260,150512,On the other hand.  @AlaskaAir gave us food vouchers for a 2 hour delay because they're awesome.  #iflyalaska
141269,150523,Hey @jetblue wish I could have watched the Lighting destroy Montreal on my flight #749. but no working tv. It's ok. I still love you
141277,150531,@AlaskaAir your emergency landing has me quarantined me in canada and i will be late for dinner.  nice
141291,150547,@DeltaAssist can I switch to an earlier flight tomorrow at no cost?
141295,150551,@united you should give broke college girls like me a discounted ticket
141300,150556,@AmericanAir $200 change/cancellation for $180 flights? Way to retain your gold members. Sorry I booked with you for 3 years. #fail
141301,150557,Waiting to board @VirginAmerica . loud pop music starts in lounge. everyone looks to see who's being rude &amp; it's the attendants. Virgin hip!
141307,150563,Never again @AlaskaAir ... Never again... ::grumble::
141308,150564,My jewelry was stolen out of my bag _ @JetBlue claim made. Let's see how this goes...
141310,150567,http://t.co/o4pN7nGWry @united this is not okay #whereisalysphone #noholesinplanes
141312,150569,@AlaskaAir you know what's awesome?  Having charging outlets at your gates.  You know what's less awesome?  75% not working at C16 in SeaTac
141313,150570,@AmericanAir Hi Ive been waiting for a refund since Febraury and need to book another flight... I need my money back! #needcustomerservice
141315,150572,@united The problem was NOT the minor delay. The problem WAS the unintelligble rubbish language that you used to describe the reason.
141318,150575,This equates to short term views for profit and not building their brand. sad. @JetBlue #thinkbigpicturenotwallst http://t.co/8zom4H6Uuo
141319,150577,Remember when $LUV used to be know for being on time??? 2nd delay @SouthwestAir #goodoledays http://t.co/ceiD4gY4UH
141323,150581,@VirginAmerica isn't a fun airplane when the computers cut out during the safety video and stay broken the whole flight
141324,150582,Also. @AlaskaAir will only let you redeem flights that it doesn't partner w/ any other airline for. SO NEVER BUY A GIFT CERTIFICATE.
141332,150591,@SouthwestAir stuck on the runway in Columbus with no info. CMH must be busy on Sunday night.
141339,150598,Shoutout to the fact that I missed prom pictures because of a delayed flight. Thanks @VirginAmerica.
141351,150612,AMERICAN AIRLINES DESTROYED MY BRAND NEW SUITCASE AND I AM JUST NOW CALMED DOWN ENOUGH TO TWEET ABOUT IT @AmericanAir
141352,150613,@DeltaAssist you all really need to stop faux cleaning planes. Never had such a smelly 5hr ride. DL477. Aweful.
141356,150618,@SouthwestAir Been a long time customer and today I just realized I can't apply my old flight funds for an upcoming trip. Truly disappointed
141367,150629,@AlaskaAir what have you done to the wings of your poor plane?! CBC is reporting you have a new config. http://t.co/zvK0ogp6av
141376,150638,@JetBlue I haven't gone anywhere this year yet and I miss y'all. I'm ready for adventure _
141378,150640,@AlaskaAir Thank you for ruining my 18th birthday. Youre the best.
141382,150646,@AmericanAir considers this an upgrade! Incredible waste of money. http://t.co/B8JGaGl9cS

141397,150662,@JetBlue wait. So the CrewBot wasn't just a gimmick? It's a real thing your actually testing...?
141399,150665,@JetBlue we haven't even left the gate and I'm already not happy with the plane crew. So disorganized... Not a good way to start my week
141400,150666,@AmericanAir I am. I wish you all would squeeze me on an earlier connecting flight.. I am going to miss a full day of a conference
141401,150667,Meet the rudest @alaskaair employee. His name is Pavel and he works at Chicago o'hare.
141412,150679,@DeltaAssist is there a known issue with getting credit for miles? I have had to contact delta 5+ times to get proper credit this year. 1/2
141414,150682,So 10 mins before we board @SouthwestAir decides to switch us to a smaller plane... Now 17 passengers have to be re routed #areyoukidding
141415,150683,@DeltaAssist  3 pounds over = $175 Mechanical delay BHM to ATL = missed connection and meetings but zero comp for me.  Come on DL
141416,150684,Where the fuck is the @AlaskaAir check in at MSP
141420,150689,@SouthwestAir you've earned a coveted seat at our table of bad writing. Party with us May 12. http://t.co/qeLC3BcQtL http://t.co/3CxMbjRn8h
141427,150696,@jetblue what happens when you miss your flight due to traffic accident at JFK. Police blocking road.
141428,150697,@united Booked an aisle seat on UA1642. Now stuck in middle seat. Now need to pay extra to get an aisle again. #StarAllianceGold.

141482,150754,Ugh not flying @VirginAmerica *sad face*
141485,150757,... Planing a NY trip sometime soon. Waiting on word from Vancouver &amp; New Jersey before booking my @JetBlue experience.
141486,150758,Relaxed and cool about the @JetBlue 2 hour delay. I get more stressed and upset when froyo machines don't work.
141487,150759,I understand when folks get queasy. but why board a flight if you are sweating and vomiting everywhere? Only my seat mate. @united #stinks
141510,150784,@AlaskaAir can't wait to go to SJO later this year.

141536,150811,Signed up for @SouthwestAir Rapid Rewards Dining today! Missed out on extra points when I ate out!
141538,150813,@VirginAmerica I think it is more of an individual issue. I'm concerned about my hyphenated last name not being hyphenated for TSA
141546,150821,It's a weather delay. It's not our fault. We don't give vouchers. But @United will strand me in Boston overnight. That's their fault.
141551,150828,Baby Avery was sick and we missed our @SouthwestAir flight. They say we must forfeit hundreds due to new policy. #unfair #NoLUV #LoyalFlyer

141654,150938,@AlaskaAir Please help a broke college student who missed her flight get back home to Seattle  PLEASE
141656,150941,@SouthwestAir why is there no rental car pick up or drop off at #LAX / terminal 1? No baggage carts either.
141657,150942,@AmericanAir is it going to be a PITA to find my missing trips from this year that I just noticed?

142790,152160,.@SouthwestAir is rerouting all 175 of us. we're getting vouchers too. Broken plane isn't their fault. but they're still making up for it.
142791,152162,I'm sorry @SouthwestAir but I have to say something...2 cancelled flights yesterday (to AND from SD) really hurt a guy. #bummer #Custexp
142792,152163,This is disgusting. @AmericanAir. Mesa should not be flying planes for you that look like this http://t.co/epRlOfRlRJ
142794,152165,@united Please tell me why my 11am flight out of OKC got cancelled  http://t.co/VMjcYi0icu

142813,152184,I__ve had a crazy experience with @AmericanAir. I don__t see them staying in business for much longer if they treat everyone like this.
142815,152186,@JetBlue Flight B6 1713 can you check the status? Is going to leave at 12:15pm right?Thanks
142817,152188,I hate @AmericanAir
142818,152189,@AmericanAir  DM. Need 2 know if my know traveler number is on my reservation. Having issues checking it online.
142823,152195,@AmericanAir Annie as the movie for both east and west flights?What did i do to make you angry? #hardknocklife
142830,152203,@AmericanAir I made resv for Boston. US Aiways for June. paypal payment went through April 17. never got my itinerary/conf code-- worried?
142831,152204,@AmericanAir on flight 1202...seat 5f is broken and the ceiling above is filthy. Sadly it doesn't seem like folks care here...
142838,152212,Me. too... Well. minus @JetBlue and that empty seat... But even a full. late flight to MCO is better than none  https://t.co/BOupfYvehP
142840,152217,@JetBlue families are annoying &amp; harassing me. Kudos to your crew for helping me out. Is it too early for white wine? #flight512 #frustrated
142841,152218,1/5- April 19 I travel from GDL to Berlin and at Dallas the plane brokes 6 hours of delay Re routed to London.  @AmericanAir
142857,152235,I'm not sure who took over the @united premier call center. but they are kicking ass. Some of the best customer service I've had in awhile.
142858,152236,@JetBlue All of my most recent flights with JetBlue have had some issue. JetBlue was by far my preferred carrier...I can't say it is now.
142860,152238,@AmericanAir #AADreamliner .... Can't wait to try
142865,152244,leave it to @southwestair to make a plane of ppl miss graduation ceremonies
142868,152247,@JetBlue Can I ask why you don't accept JetBlue credit to upgrade already purchased seats? Very frustrating.
142869,152248,What an annoying experience trying to board a @SouthwestAir flight to #NYC from Akron. #notcool
142881,152260,I would go to east Texas. my father's health is failing and he has never met his grandson who is now 3 years old.  @JetBlue #FlyingItForward
142883,152262,@JetBlue If you're flying JEtBlue you already lost. #jetbluesucks

142892,152273,@SouthwestAir I have been with you for years. I have been stuck in Portland since 5am with no answers. I will be canceling my credit card.

142905,152286,@AmericanAir please can you forward me an email address for delayed flight compensation ? Thankyou
142908,152289,@JetBlue Vegas would be a great place for me n my man to ty the knot. I've never been...
142912,152293,Just when I think they can't be any worse. @AmericanAir sorry for Denying Wheelchair to Cancer Patient http://t.co/S5uKhnAg8c #travel #fail
142921,152303,@DeltaAssist Had to miss my flight at Chicago because Delta gave 8 tags for 7 luggages. I also paid extra for nothing.

142942,152324,@AmericanAir i think tje new 787aircraft has bad luck since other flights are being cancelled... Bad starts. end worsts
142962,152344,I've been spoiled on @AlaskaAir so much lately I forgot just how terrible other airlines are
142963,152345,@united accidentally booked wrong return destination&amp;still within 24hr. but cant wait for my e-cert refund -anyway to change PHL to NYC/HPN?
142973,152356,@JetBlue normally so good for me at on time and quality...today not so much.  Late flight and non-working headset on the TV! #offday
142992,152377,Did @JetBlue offer free flights for cops to the funeral when Eric Frein killed the PA cop? Just curious #NYPD
143005,152392,@united UA5284 on time but parked at a broken jet way. Now taxi-ing all the way around the terminal to get to a working gate. Not impressed.
143009,152397,Sad that @AlaskaAir lost my moms luggage between SEA and MSP
143010,152398,@JetBlue it sucks that I have to wait a month before getting points though. Should be instantaneous.
143019,152409,@AlaskaAir I had to wait 30 minutes for my checked baggage. Flight 335 from SJC to SEA. How can I get my bonus miles? Thanks.
143021,152412,@SouthwestAir who can I make a formal complaint to?
143030,152422,@DeltaAssist what's happening in ATL that's got me stuck in EVV?
143037,152430,@SouthwestAir get me to my BFF!! Can't wait. #IAD #DIA http://t.co/EdgvUIS8Pj
143043,152436,@SouthwestAir I just broke down. I'm being held by a stranger who isn't making his destination. http://t.co/otsqlRlYWJ

143067,152461,@JetBlue My morning started off horrible and I missed my flight. but the JetBlue team was amazing and I had the best experience! Thank you!
143069,152464,Hey @united we need to talk. You owe me $1200 for canceling my flight to CMH and im missing my vacation tomorrow. #worstairline
143075,152472,.@SouthwestAir So what's the problem with flight 267 tonight?
143080,152477,@AmericanAir I'm on FLT 3499. Supposed to leave at 7:40. now 8:40. I'm not holding my breath.
143081,152478,@JetBlue screaming baby + a non-functional headphone jack = a very unpleasant flight to Denver
143082,152479,@AmericanAir-communicating via your website about issue since January and getting run around.The new AA is not my friend yet #comebackUSAir
143084,152481,@DeltaAssist hello. I want to cancel my reservation. how can I do it ?
143087,152484,Heartbroken that I cannot get to LA tonight as planned. Does a $200 voucher mend a broken heart &amp; ruined Mother's Day? :( @SouthwestAir
143100,152499,@AmericanAir your frontline folks consistently missed it today. Your sentiments and their actions don't match. #raisethebar
143102,152501,by rpbonnell I'm sad I wasn't on @americanair's inaugural #787 flight today. but I did get to go on my first #dream__ http://t.co/iTqZscH0eB
143114,152514,I think @VirginAmerica should allow titles like Crazy MoFo. BOSS. and Wicked Smaat. Totally in brand. And fun.
143117,152517,@DeltaAssist flew from Barbados to JFK currently waiting for the connecting flight to heathrow. My travel partners bag made it here.....
143128,152528,Maybe I can leave copies of #HappyHourChoir with @SouthwestAir FA__s__ #cantstopwontstop
143129,152529,Guess I'm going somewhere on my birthday. oh wait our birthday! @SouthwestAir #iseeyou #June18 #drinkup http://t.co/Ki1ioRN8pW
143133,152533,@AlaskaAir all good. Your CS is usually awesome. SeaTac. Just a quick check if boarding is delayed between front desk &amp; gate.
143134,152534,Website &amp; email system for @JetBlue is atrociously bad. Sent my conf details to everybody when I try to send an itinerary &amp; more problems.
143136,152536,@AmericanAir I think I just figured it out. I was looking for AA198P which is JFK to Milan. The letter P was the missing factor. &gt;
143141,152542,@AmericanAir  having the most trouble in booking a flight that's on hold... I want to use my electronic gift card but the option isn't there
143160,152561,@AmericanAir is playing The XX as I get on my plane to LA. slow clap!!
143162,152563,@AmericanAir handled. Lots of confused faces at dca today. Flights show on time with arriving aircraft way late.
143163,152564,@united: can I just have one trip without problems? I don't even fly that often! #exhausting
143172,152573,Looks like I'm going to be sleepless in Seattle. My flight's delayed by 1.25 hr. Why @AlaskaAir? No bad weather around.
143178,152579,@united Your airplanes made me miss a putt while golfing today so I'm not pleased with you.
143183,152585,@united Not clear where my luggage is and delayed overnight. so I'm hoping for the best. #customerexperience
143184,152586,@AmericanAir 5260. Just landed at CAK. Really warm and uncomfortable flight. Cramped. Gross.
143192,152595,@AlaskaAir same issue in iPhone and iPad. Had to uninstall to get updated trip info.
143199,152603,What the fuck just happened #subtweet @JetBlue
143201,152605,@DeltaAssist skymiles missing for tkts VN #7382107135487 (me) + #7382107135488 (husband). 2 legs: 4/20 SFO-TPE on CI 3 + 5/5 TPE-SFO on CI 4
143202,152606,Looks like @AmericanAir Flight 187 to PEK is delayed overnight.....again!
143229,152637,@AmericanAir plane full of patrons delayed and about to miss connections because of understaffed FAs? Unforgivable.
143231,152639,Here I come #Seattle! On the plane waiting for takeoff from Kauai. It's going to be sunny too! _ Wheee! #EmeraldCity @AlaskaAir
143237,152646,Flying on @SouthwestAir is like ride a fucking bus.
143238,152647,Can't take a delay today connecting flight is going to leave me ___ @AmericanAir flight 2243 tell 1089 wait lol #ep http://t.co/glO066JkB1
143243,152652,Very unsatisfied with the way @SouthwestAir puts you in longer line if you come with a boarding pass. Not bringing one next time!
143244,152653,@AmericanAir it wasn't the wait for an agent. but just getting a hard time
143245,152654,@JetBlue not really. Hd to leave son behind due to a medical emergency. Hd bought non refundable tkts so no refund n no fun
143249,152658,@United Why did you change my seat assignment when I checked in? I had aisle and now I'm in the middle. Really upset.
143266,152676,@United #Airlines. why are you so bad? And why must I keep forgetting this and booking you? #sad #Ipaidtoomuchforthis #redeye #overbooked
143273,152683,@JetBlue while waiting for mom to arrive I've purchased 2 ice coffees. a yogurt and pineapple. Oh ya it's also my birthday today...
143274,152684,@AmericanAir yes. I was put on a later flight and got home. But your staff needs retraining. Back half of the plane all missed flights
143281,152691,@united you need a better #customerservice program in place. Yes. we're all tired but to have a hostile disposition towards everyone is bad.
143282,152692,@JetBlue Still waiting not only for my miles but also badges for my trip 4/21 - 4/23. What do I do?
143285,152695,"People clogging the boarding line trying to be ""first"" in your boarding group. I hope you have a bad flight. Jerks. @AlaskaAir #etiquette"
143286,152696,Hey @AmericanAir see how long it took me to have you not resolve my issue? Global data=559 minutes. Toll TBD .25/min http://t.co/HBnZFtoqkn
143289,152700,@AmericanAir I've been stuck on the tarmac so long-im missing my connection &amp; thus my gma's 80th birthday party. Very displeased. Shape up.
143291,152703,@JetBlue really hope I don't miss my JFK connection because of a delay at RDU.
143293,152705,@AmericanAir Solving an unresolved issue with some of my AAdvantage miles would be a start.
143298,152710,@AmericanAir I was upset that I couldnt even get on hold. Just got hung up on by the auto system. but I got through &amp; Mike was great-Thanks
143303,152715,@JetBlue can't wait for my flight to the wedding of #tessandcharlie
143304,152716,@united so. I book my flights get PNR numbers and then you decide to cancel my tickets without letting me know? #Ridiculous
143309,152721,Hey @SouthwestAir how often do you run the 50.000 point specials for signing up for a SW credit card?  I'm thinking about switching to you.
143311,152723,@JetBlue just canceled our flight &amp; sent all of us back through security to rebook. Way to go JB - wonderful start to our vacay.  #sucks
143318,152730,@AlaskaAir great. only issue I__ve had. Seemed to be caused by changing an existing booking__s destination. Changes to schedule have been fine
143322,152734,Cancel a mans flight. strand him in chicago overnight. then overbook his flight the next morning. What the hell @AmericanAir
143331,152743,Just got my email reminder to check into my flight..can't wait to fly @VirginAmerica to Las Vegas today

143341,152754,Waiting at the gate. sipping a drink and feelin' fine...heading to #Vegas to see Metallica. \m/ _ \m/... hugs to @DeltaAssist *SD you rock
143350,152764,@AmericanAir shuttle terminal at LAX is BS - adds 25-30 mins to trip waiting for an f'ng bus to main term. Ride circling loop. Bad bad...
143361,152780,.@alaskaair Thanks to Steven in Customer Care for crediting a missing seg. Great CS skills.
143376,152795,@SouthwestAir I filed a lost and found report - what's the best way to help find it??

143404,152825,@SouthwestAir I miss doing this.
143405,152826,Another delayed flight out of DCA. Aren't you getting tired of this dance @AmericanAir?? I know I am.

143455,152880,@DeltaAssist I can't believe how poorly my lost baggage claim was handled. I guess it's easier to cut a check than actually look for the bag
143456,152881,Another @SouthwestAir delay. 2 for 2 in 2015. Luv it.
143457,152882,@DeltaAssist i need the number to baggage claim at dca. Lost bag!

148763,158561,Flying on @united is an exercise in humility and meditation. No room whatsoever for tall men flying economy class. New planes killing us.
148767,158565,@SouthwestAir you neglect to answer the real issue; its allowing these people who have to fly to work now because of #NTSB disaster (1/2)
148771,158569,Huge failure on the part of @SouthwestAir. FAA regulations can wait when a life is at stake. https://t.co/nZVgBEckLy

148819,158623,The AAdvantage @AmericanAir does not allow reservation info to be sent to two emails.  This is a huge negative compared to Dividend Miles
148827,158633,@DeltaAssist The name on my ticket is wrong. It combined by first &amp; middle name to one name. Is this going to be an issue for my flight?

148935,158749,@DeltaAssist looks like you broke login on the new android app. :/
148940,158755,@SouthwestAir when you're in a long distance relationship. the last thing you need is a delayed flight going to see them _ #whyyyyyy
148947,158762,@united its one thing when weather holds you back. but another when 100 people wait 30-60 minutes for baggage to arrive.  #lax #hirebetter
148949,158764,@JetBlue so turns out I think I left my Kindle on this flight (623 JFK-&gt;LAX on 4/14). Do you have a lost and found? I'm only a month late :)

148963,158780,@AmericanAir still don't understand how in this day and age we can't solve the overhead bin problem.  I have to go 13 rows back from row 10!
148967,158784,It's not @SouthwestAir fault your husband killed himself. Man. this world is unbelievable.  Always blame somebody else.
148971,158788,@SouthwestAir 8pm BWI-&gt;ALB delayed to 10:45 (not that u bothered 2tell me). Didn't switch to 10:20 flight &amp; now delay=12:25am. 10:20 full

148979,158796,@AmericanAir I hate you.
148982,158799,@DeltaAssist - I know you are doing your best. I am very worried about the 2 dogs in the cargo hold though. Their owners are very upset.
148998,158816,Hi @AmericanAir you suck as human beings
149000,158818,@DeltaAssist sure did.  Many others having the same problems.  Check google play store comments
149009,158828,Come on @AmericanAir how can a 30 min flight from MCO to MIA take 2 hrs? You guys are sucking today!
149010,158829,As a ff with AA. Perhaps I need to switch back to @united http://t.co/BBfBZ5XasB
149014,158833,@DeltaAssist will do. We might need it if we miss our connection.
149015,158834,@SouthwestAir Stuck at OAK. extra seats on earlier flights. #customerservice  says my ticket type doesn't qualify for Standby. I call foul.

149045,158867,Ok but #drunksonaplane jokes aside. This has been the best delay I've ever had. @JetBlue is the best. But can we get some free drinks? _
149046,158868,@SouthwestAir 2154 late as usual what happened to on time?? We had to wait for connecting passengers maybe their plane could've let them off

149084,158908,@VirginAmerica Hi! I'm having a hell of a time trying to check in &amp; print my boarding pass whenever I try the site says I have no flights?
149096,158920,So. @united... why buy insurance for refunds if you're just going to issue vouchers?!
149099,158923,@DeltaAssist I assume you're aware of the updated apps login issue?
149103,158927,Incompetence is what @united does best. Ridiculously bad every time.
149105,158930,@united hmmm no response to earlier tweet.  Guess lots of rules are applied unevenly.
149113,158939,@VirginAmerica SF-LA VX942 scheduled to leave 740 PM got pushed to 920 without ANY notification? I thought VX is not one of those airlines..
149116,158942,@SouthwestAir After reading about that poor woman who's husband killed himself I hope you go bankrupt. I'll never fly with you.
149117,158943,@JetBlue  f$;King sucks. Makes me board then wait an hour on plane. With kids and elderly on board. NEVER again delta people

149153,158981,Never have issues with @southwestair but don't know what happened tonight trying to get out of BWI. 30 min delay = no last train home.
149171,159000,.@SouthwestAir lands us in CO Springs for a nonexistent medical. won't tell us if we have to stay or can leave. Nothing in airport open. Wee

149225,159056,@DeltaAssist so you want biz class psgrs to like you??? still wait for bag after 3 days!!
149229,159061,After 6 years of flying @JetBlue .... This one time ruined it and I won't anymore. Canceling flight for no reason? No compensation? No help?

151524,161474,Im willing to overlook the bag @SouthwestAir lost and currently cannot locate. #AllMyStuff
151536,161487,@AmericanAir there were no alternate seat options. and we missed out on almost a full day in Paris. Waiting to see how we'll be compensated.

151586,161540,@united your router on the plane was broken.  this is not a issue over getting a refund. this is a issue of your planes being out dated.

151624,161581,@united yes we did at 5:00. our 20th wedding anniversary celebration will have to wait. The plane waited for our luggage and left w/o us
151631,161589,.@SouthwestAir flight crew didn't let woman call her suicidal husband. he killed himself; they offered a refund http://t.co/Jpg7dEoVXT

151641,161599,@SouthwestAir first time flying SWA and probably my last. Delayed 3x already.
151645,161603,@JetBlue Why do I need to call your customer care center and wait 15 minutes to simply cancel a flight? Ridiculous.
151666,161627,OMG @SouthwestAir 4120 pilot is insane. We're flying through clouds so ofc bad turbulence. No alt change? Really? Clear air 1000' up.
151668,161629,LOL. @AmericanAir requires iOS 8 or newer. Get lost.
151684,161646,I can't believe how long it took @AmericanAir to credit my missing miles from my last trip. #disappointedasusual
151695,161657,@AlaskaAir why is there no more stand by? $25 to switch to an hour earlier flight?
151701,161663,@JetBlue My flight was delayed. now it's not. No notification. Just hoping I don't miss my flight. What's the deal?
151704,161666,@AmericanAir why say 15 mins when u don't know? &amp; when customer asks 4 water n an extended wait. DON'T say ALL other planes have 2 wait 2
151705,161667,@DeltaAssist I have not received a vegetarian meal on my past 2 flights so I had to starve. How can I set vegetarian preference so I can eat

151742,161705,S/O to @united for getting me on an earlier flight so that I don't miss my connecting one and hooking it up with more leg room 
151749,161715,@AmericanAir Props to Jenny  &amp; rest of  crew AA 259 as they handled medical emergency on board &amp; return to SFO. We leave again for DFW soon.
151750,161716,"@SouthwestAir has delayed 6 out of the last 8 flights I flew with them. I deeply regret being a ""valuable"" cardholder"
151751,161717,@DeltaAssist hearing rumors Delta 1697 will be cancelled tonight. True?
151755,161721,@DeltaAssist they want to go back home since they'll miss the funeral by 6hrs. but staff there wants to give grief by haggling over a refund
151756,161722,Stranded in Baltimore tonight. missing work tomorrow. paying for own hotel. Would've liked a little more empathy from @SouthwestAir  #bummed
151761,161727,@JetBlue is never a disappointment! Those new first class/ mint seats are AMAZING! Especially on cross country flights! _
151764,161730,@SouthwestAir - first time my boys flew...SWA couldn't come up with a pair of wings for them. Customer experience fail.
151768,161735,Won't get to watch the game tonight. gonna be flying. Sad that @SouthwestAir doesn't have NBCSN but let's go Rangers!!!!! #NYR
151771,161738,I must admit I am a little disappointed with @JetBlue I can't understand how they are unable to seat a mother and child together.
151775,161743,Hi @AmericanAir - trying to get through to Advantage desk. not getting any options to speak w agent or leave a call back. Is there an issue?
151779,161747,@DeltaAssist now 20! Somehow I have a duplicate account I need points transferred and the duplicate closed. Very sad

151850,161820,@AmericanAir my husband just missed his flight to New York and his connection to Puerto Rico. this has happened to him twice he is really
151858,161828,@VirginAmerica Thx for getting us on an earlier flight out of JFK. Your crew is gracious though some people are grumpy with the delay.
151870,161840,@AmericanAir sitting on US airways 2027.  Pilot has no information on when we can push back and is awaiting a phone call to tell him.
151871,161841,@AmericanAir since becoming a card member an flying exclusively with your airline I have had nothing but bad experiences #alwaysdelayed
151873,161844,@SouthwestAir why is flight 139 delayed to 12:40 am tonight.
151876,161848,Another @united delayed flight home from Chicago to DC. How is it we are waiting for a crew third trip in a row!
151877,161849,Seems that @AmericanAir has lost part of the robot BETA heading to compete in ABC's #Battlebots. that has potential for PR disaster for them
151879,161851,@AmericanAir frustrating when I was under the impression of booking American.  I don't like US airways- aircrafts way too small
151883,161855,@AmericanAir what news of the us92 flight to manchester from Chicago?  2 hours late and no current info for your passengers
151893,161865,@united so you cancel my flight to Laguardia. don't notify me via email or text and don't offer me hotel because you say you aren't liable?
151909,161883,"@AmericanAir What happened to the ""Delete expired boarding passes"" option? You're killing me"
151920,161895,@AmericanAir 1)U have sucking down to a science. I've followed several friends who've all had major delays or cancellations on your airline
151948,161923,@DeltaAssist seriously you close the sky priority line at 7:00 pm in ATL.  Gonna miss my flight.
151953,161929,@DeltaAssist flights to Syracuse got canceled tonight now stuck in Boston overnight. Have to miss work and make arrangements for my dogs.

151996,161973,@united it__s tough keeping loyalty when flights are delayed a lot #ORDtoDCA
152017,161996,@AmericanAir Can you PLEASE leave on time ONE Flipping time?  AHHHHHHHHH.  I just want to scream!!!!!!
152023,162003,Why do i have more riciculously bad travel days on @united than any other airline? Uggghhh
152024,162004,@JetBlue Just got home to DCA. Checked bag was completely ruined. plus many things inside it soaked in liquid. Great Service...
152025,162005,@SouthwestAir Your witty banter works better when you're not 1 1/2 hours late.  Seem more like carnival barkers...
152027,162007,@SouthwestAir I understand the delay! Safety first. But I packed my breastpump. Anyone have any babies I can nurse? On the house. #ouchies
152033,162013,So. @AmericanAir thinks it's ok to cancel flights and give the metaphorical bird to stranded passengers. You live and learn.
152035,162015,@SouthwestAir what's the protocol for holding a connecting flight? Friend flying into Chicago is still waiting on gate after landing....
152044,162025,@SouthwestAir my second flight back to back that's been delayed. What's going on SWA? You're my go to airline.
152045,162026,@SouthwestAir Vacation = . Getting delayed indefinitely in ATL =_ if the crew won't make it just tell us and cancel. #waitinggame #238
152049,162031,@SouthwestAir Flight with orig dep of 7:10 has been reported to leave at 10:20. 9:45 &amp; 11:00 in that order. #ICallBullshit
152074,162058,@SouthwestAir Luckily yes. our delayed flight was pushed up and we made it ok.
152077,162061,Last time I fly with @VirginAmerica - plane is 2.5 hrs late. board the plane. tell us we'll wait on the runway for 1.5 hrs to takeoff. #wtf
152083,162067,@DeltaAssist If there is a woman at the bar who is drunk who should I tell?  She's obnoxious. I fear she's on our flight.
152084,162068,@DeltaAssist got to Atlanta. Now waiting for an 11:30 connection. #longday
152090,162074,Seriously depressed I missed lower points #summervacation to Seattle. Total is now twice what I saved. Send me some points love @JetBlue!
152105,162090,Here's to hoping our flight to Columbus isn't delayed past midnight @SouthwestAir #stranded
152108,162093,Waiting for late arriving passengers. @SouthwestAir didn't wait for me earlier and closed the door as I was walking down jetway.
152112,162098,Really @JetBlue - bag drop at Portland Airport takes longer than full service! What is point of checking in early? Bad job
152114,162100,@VirginAmerica your technical support sucks! They can't tell me what's wrong with my phone!
152119,162105,@DeltaAssist it isn't Delta's fault the weather was bad.  I'm upset the policies don't do more 4 folks on plane. offer a coke &amp; snack
152122,162108,@DeltaAssist I am hungry. tired and lost at ATL because of a missed connection. Im rescheduled for 6:55am but where am I supposed to sleep??

152159,162146,@SouthwestAir Your bad weather excuse is getting old. I think u are full of it.
152165,162152,@DeltaAssist every time I fly into LGA with your airline we wait on the ramp for an extended period of time for a gate... This is nonsense

152632,162640,looking forward to flying @JetBlue today! The anticipation I feel while waiting to board the aircraft is the same as when I was a young lad!

152716,162728,@SouthwestAir why would yall only schedule 1 fight a day to SJO? It has really caused issues with trip. FYI #SWA needs 2 flights 1 AM &amp; 1 PM
152717,162729,mechanical issues with @AlaskaAir delayed my flight to tomorrow - thanks for making my trip $500 more expensive due to a loss day at work.
152727,162739,@AmericanAir are your phones broke today? Unable to reach you by phone.

152768,162782,@DeltaAssist being sorry at my disappointment puts the onus on me for feeling the way I do. I have a better idea:
152769,162783,@united is there a link where I can leave my complaint ?
152778,162792,@JetBlue ...why are your flights out of LGA always cancelled / late ...looks like u have an operations issue. Other airlines are on time
152780,162794,Yay. more delayed flights on @AmericanAir. This seems to be the normal these days. 
152817,162832,Never gotten over how cool this is @VirginAmerica https://t.co/bf3E6HAwvO

152860,162877,@AmericanAir every time I call the phone hangs up the moment the agent comes on the line -- 3 times in a row.  Problems with call center?

153114,163141,Wait how much are miles worth in Bitcoin @united
153131,163161,@SouthwestAir needs to give me a refund because out of 8 flights I've taken this year. ZERO have been on time departures #poorservice #cmon
153140,163171,Is it much to expect that @united would have support for PassBook. 3 years after its release? Sigh.
153161,163192,.@AmericanAir Coming up on delay #4 now and doesn't look like we'll make this departure time. I wonder if I'll be home before breakfast.
153162,163193,@SouthwestAir I suppose I will no longer be flying with Southwest - I don't support companies that ignore multiple attempts to contact them.
153163,163194,@AmericanAir trying to book a flight to London...very sad that other major airlines are beating your price by &gt; $400...

153578,163634,Stuck on the tarmac on a @VirginAmerica flight due to lightning. We could sure use some of this rain in California.
153580,163636,.@VirginAmerica #EWR  #SFO 30 minutes delay  ok ok you are not so perfect how articles say.
153597,163654,@jetblue my flight is delayed. Tell me a joke to pass the time.
153603,163660,@DeltaAssist why have I been on hold for nearly half an hour for cargo/shipping a live animal questions? :(
153617,163675,Only 18min delayed despite #IAH being shut down for 90min. Not bad @United #shuttingdown #HoustonBound https://t.co/3NnJjQi14M
153623,163682,My @JetBlue flight has been so delayed that it gets in at 1AM now and I'm gonna have to shell out major $$ for a cab :/ :/ :/
153624,163683,@AmericanAir Platinum desk should have best agents. Lost 2 upgrade seats bc 25 min to process 1st seat. then other seat gone. Disappointing
153634,163694,@DeltaAssist how do I contact the Atlanta sky lounge (D) to find a missing ring?
153646,163706,@JetBlue I'm not happy with you
153651,163711,@AmericanAir Why is it that I can't seem to get my miles redeemed from an LAX--&gt;NRT flight? That's a lot of missing points. guys.
153654,163714,Sounds like me with @united last week. Still waiting. I feel your pain. https://t.co/SwfitVbY2U
153670,163730,@united Any luck in resolving this?  I keep getting the run around and it is frustrating. Different agents give different answers!
153672,163732,@AmericanAir 933 delayed in O'Hare because they are looking for another capitan... What is going on here?
153673,163733,Living my worst nightmare- forgot my @SouthwestAir drink tickets at home.
153680,163740,this looks like an actual @JetBlue advert except for the poor clarity http://t.co/Mqq6WUBSey
153684,163744,@SouthwestAir. can you please not cancel the 7:55pm flt out of SJC to BUR? I have a funny feeling that's going to happen since it's delayed
153685,163745,@united. You cheated me. I pay biz class to lhr and you close security at o hare. The last time I fly with you
153690,163750,@JetBlue BOS is a nice place to visit but I sure miss the LGB to IAD nonstop flight. any chance of it or a nonstop to the DC area ?
153693,163753,@AmericanAir At jfk there's only 1 staff dedicated to checking in 10+ Platinum customers in line. more than 30 min wait time for me :-(
153694,163754,Neat technique from @united to avoid bad feedback - #badsurveys #usability http://t.co/dfuAU3PAA6
153704,163765,HUGE S/O to Rosie &amp; Jerry @SouthwestAir Customer Service this eve 4 their never say die approach to troubleshooting my issue. LUV SWA! 
153711,163772,@JetBlue is the best airline to compensate you when they mess up. Free in-flight movies on a 6hr plane trip? Best 2 hour delay.
153717,163778,Boarded at 8:25. Take off at 9:45... Thanks @JetBlue . Can I have an Ambien with this delay?
153718,163779,Mrs getting in late via @AmericanAir. Can. Not. Wait. #twoarebetterthanone #manAndWoman
153721,163782,@united Flying from ORD and no Premier Access lane open? C'mon now with a 30 minute wait at your hub... 
153729,163790,@DeltaAssist don't leave without me please! http://t.co/C2kWqLIais
153741,163803,Why the delay notification @JetBlue? Scheduled arrival was 1029pm (2680 on 5/20). http://t.co/XW1vPtAATO
153771,163836,@DeltaAssist - All the crew members on flight 1669 from ATL to MCO deserve a BIG raise. They made a long delay not so bad at all. #thankyou
153773,163838,How am I supposed to watch the Ducks game tomorrow when I'm 35.000 feet above the ground??! Oh wait. I can. Thanks @JetBlue ! #youdarealmvp
153774,163839,@SouthwestAir you had one job and you failed
153778,163843,@DeltaAssist is anyone working in the sky miles dept tonight?  Going on 37 minutes waiting for someone to pickup
153793,163859,My feet up... I'll kick it with you  @SouthwestAir  http://t.co/NMznwXjFxg
153798,163864,@SouthwestAir you are losing your edge. 2 delayed flights in 1 day.
153800,163866,@alaskaair Are you guys having technical issues? Your website and mobile apps are barely responsive. Trying to check-in w/o success.
153804,163871,@alaskaair every time I am not able to fly with you and have to use the other airlines. I miss you so much. #yourehappier
153808,163875,I wish I could teleport to NYC. Planes are so boring. At least @VirginAmerica doesn't suck.
153813,163880,.@VirginAmerica pls tell me what i did to deserve 6+ hours in a seat that doesnt recline so i never do it again
153815,163882,"Waited 50 mins for @AmericanAir to ""call me back"" disconnected me for the 2nd time today. Now have to wait 45 more mins? Get it together!!!"
153827,163894,@united news to me. I flew back from Argentina with three bags late March. the policy change was a shocker and sent me scrambling. I'm done
153835,163902,"On board one of @jetblue brand new planes . Can't wait to get back ""home"" #disney #wdw see you all real soon!!!"
153839,163906,@united I don't care about your miles. u r 2 slow for your security concerns.need assistance? https://t.co/NiwCQrMgIS http://t.co/xcsE3CEQpG
153841,163908,@united your security lanes arent even moving and I'm about to miss my flight. You need to open up more lanes this early in the morning
153844,163912,That awkward moment when your plane is at the airport. but your captain is missing. It's too early for these delays @AmericanAir
153847,163916,Good morning @JetBlue my ride is stuck in traffic. U think u can hold my flight from JFK to DR for me?  Kidding not kidding
153849,163918,@DeltaAssist flew sea Ams Muc today bag is missing  #fail
153850,163919,@DeltaAssist your lost baggage handling leaves a lot to be desired. There's a group of students in Italy since Tuesday and still no luggage
153857,163926,@united I was able to confirm my travel!! No need to cancel! Now what are the chances i will be upgraded to first class?!
153858,163927,Cannot wait for the @AmericanAir #merger to be over and done with!
153860,163929,When did @SouthwestAir make so many extra categories to preboard? I miss when it was just if you check in first you got on 1st..
153875,163944,@VirginAmerica don't forget about chicago! #lovevirginamerica but there are never good deals for us!
153878,163947,@united any way to check status of a delayed bag online or via email? (Can't make calls where I am).
153887,163957,"OH MY GOD! Ur a TREE! - lippy broad squeezin by in crowded @SouthwestAir aisle. ""You. Are. TALL! I GOTTA WAIT FOR THIS TREE TO MOVE!"" (x2)"
153890,163960,"@SouthwestAir sad to be on ""another"" airline today. No legroom.  Cramped seats. NOT any #LUV to be found. Sniffles. Tears."
153899,163969,Never flying Delta again. this shit E. @JetBlue forever _
153903,163973,Met @jetblue #JetBluewingman she doesn't like waiting either lol https://t.co/j3GVnMG29E

153905,163975,@SouthwestAir flights are always delayed out of #LGA #laguardia
153906,163976,I'm pretty disappointed in @JetBlue -- I passed out on the subway yesterday en route to JFK and they will not let me credit my ticket
153916,163986,@DeltaAssist why when I do the mobile check in. I can't get my boarding pass to display on my phone?  Setting issue?
153926,163996,For the 1st time in 15 years. @SouthwestAir has truly disappointed me. #bummer #sadface
153927,163997,Stuck on runway in MIA due to congestion. Hope we make connecting flight @AmericanAir  #waitingtostartmyvacation
153931,164001,@DeltaAssist flying today.  Is it possible to leave on an earlier flight?
153939,164011,@JetBlue new plane smell. FlyFi and an amazing B6-223 Crew :) I love how the lead flight attendant is paying attention even to the kids 
153945,164017,Dear @VirginAmerica I cannot turn my music up loud enough to drown out your atrocious youth-oriented safety video.
153950,164022,airport security sucked but in the end the view and customer service from @SouthwestAir was excellent http://t.co/qFWVodzgA9
153958,164032,#Airlines getting the most hate on #socialmedia. Love @jetblue not surprised they have the most positive results http://t.co/FQ13yKgSF3
153972,164047,Just checked into my @JetBlue BOS -&gt; FLL flight for tomorrow! Can't wait!
153974,164049,.@DeltaAssist trying to change flights from LGA to CMH tonight. have been on hold for 20 mins - what's the best number to call?
153975,164051,@DeltaAssist why is it my miles Are always screwed up after a flight. How is it my flight from Atlanta to Boston is worth zero miles?
153978,164054,flight from Phoenix to Chicago is the first time I've had problems on @SouthwestAir I want to be upset but normally it's smooth sailing 
153984,164061,@DeltaAssist if I need to cancel an upcoming trip and I have the trip protection what does that help ?
153990,164067,@united is shit! *sigh
153993,164070,6 countries. 8 cities and @VirginAmerica rips off my TSA approved lock. ruining my luggage on my last flight!
153995,164072,@AmericanAir This is completely unacceptable for an interntnl flight considering check in time and house and pets. http://t.co/X9e18iKomP
154000,164077,S/o to @united for looking out for our safety. but having to switch planes is gonna be a hassle.
154010,164087,@AmericanAir I need to cancel a flight scheduled for 5/26/15.  Can you help me with this?
154011,164088,I love VA. but I'd never fly @virginamerica  if it were actually populated with the monsters on the__ https://t.co/Zzs7Fb3vo4
154023,164101,@AlaskaAir I live on the wrong coast. so I've never flown with you before. OUTLETS. I love you.
154055,164134,@DeltaAssist How do airlines expect Deaf passengers to board a plane when the gates r posted wrong &amp; leave early! http://t.co/fn1iZFfBO4
154058,164137,@DeltaAssist I waited 30 minutes for a rep about seating. and it was a waste of my time because I didn't receive any real help.
154062,164141,I paid for a seat and storage. Why does group 5 always have to check! Bad rule enforcement on board. I see small bags up there. @united
154067,164147,@DeltaAssist filled out the lost and found form... But also stopped by the LAX baggage office... Where else could it be?
154070,164150,The @JetBlue pigeon ads make me REALLY sad for pigeons.
154072,164152,2/@united etc could save ton of money &amp; delay time by force checking carryons once algo says carry on capacity reached. #callmebaby
154084,164166,@united you can't control the weather! I made it on time and didn't miss any of my flights. Now I'm home in Barcelona.
154087,164169,OK @SouthwestAir I saw this hilarious video today. thought of u! Ignore that $8 WiFi complaint to u yesterday. LOL! http://t.co/tXEfQYWYEG
154090,164172,@united looks like the gate agents are missing for flight 1055 IAH-EWR suppose to board now http://t.co/faekkzfRyL
154100,164182,Always better to have an engine fail on the ground than in the air @AmericanAir #2456
154105,164187,@united I am upset by how I was treated today in Houston
154109,164191,@AmericanAir I paid the upgrade for the seat and there was an airline captain sitting in 8f. U need to come up with a better excuse!!
154110,164192,My @JetBlue plane turned around from Jamaica cause they 'thought' a cargo door was open--it wasn't. Due to delay now we need a new crew.
154111,164193,I didn't ask for this drink #JenMadeMeDoIt #Drinks @jetblue #Waiting
154115,164197,My flight later tonight is already delayed an hour. @united WHY MUST WE ALWAYS DANCE THIS DANCE?
154122,164204,@DeltaAssist Have a DL rsvn for which I want to switch ff# from DL to AS.  How do I do it?
154130,164212,Wish I was flying @JetBlue today. When are you going to fly to Rapid City. SD?! Obviously never. Oh well. See you soon. JB.
154137,164219,I WOULD HAVE MADE MY FLIGHT IF FUCKING @united HADN'T SENT ME TO THE WRONG FUCKING CONCOURSE
154146,164228,what makes coming home from college special? when @JetBlue destroys you're beloved championship winning field hockey stick beyond repair
154147,164229,@SouthwestAir Every single time I fly with you guys. there is a delay. 100% of the time. it happens ALL THE TIME! http://t.co/b743avkTqe
154156,164239,Flying across an ocean &amp; there are no personal entertainment systems on this plane. It's like flying to the past. You suck. @AmericanAir!
154158,164241,@AmericanAir no seat. lost luggage and missed connections this airline is a disgrace. DO NOT FLY #americanairlines
154159,164242,Too many issues with @AmericanAir today. #NEVERAGAIN
154185,164268,I think the AC is broken in the @SouthwestAir terminal here in ATL.
154192,164275,Departure time was 2:50 pm. Funny how it still shows as on time @united Will miss connection on the way home! http://t.co/m4WHE3jdsF
154195,164279,@DeltaAssist following a weather delay and mechanical issues. I am now trapped on my plane. Is this a joke? http://t.co/DTPw3zgJQl
154201,164285,@AmericanAir AA 2475. No upgrade. I am going to fly out what I have booked and switch to Delta. I have lifetime status there and get upgrds
154206,164290,Reason # infinity why @VirginAmerica rules...points awarded on your birthday.  Getting old isn't so bad after all.
154207,164291,@SouthwestAir seems like you are never on time anymore.
154211,164296,@AmericanAir is trying to ruin my vacation  why are their planes never on time?!
154229,164314,@DeltaAssist can you tell me why my status and all my miles trackers on the app just lost a lot of status and travel towards next tier
154238,164323,@DeltaAssist Talk is cheap. Inherent problem with Delta. but 16 from SYD to LAX http://t.co/wuTOVwgV3l
154241,164326,Going to CA next wk. I have to fly a pedestrian airline not @VirginAmerica. Their rates were too high this time. That never happens! Torture
154244,164329,@AlaskaAir bag got damaged but they immediately gave me a new on. Transferred my stuff and was on my way. #awesomecustomerservice #thankyou
154248,164333,@JetBlue thanks - but I think I got the wrong link as I do not see where to record complaint. Can you pls clarify?
154254,164339,Have had (an extremely filthy/hilarious version of) that catchy @VirginAmerica flight safety announcement song stuck in my head all day!
154260,164345,@united very disappointed in your call center - had them tell me one thing last night and then not follow through when I called back today
154262,164347,@united you're killing me. I'd like to get to San Diego sometime tonight. Ual240 ugh!
154263,164348,@DeltaAssist when booking domestic flight with miles. can you get the points reimbursed if you cancel or change your flight?!

154298,164384,Even though my flight home to DFW is a little late @AmericanAir has kept me informed. Will be glad to be safely home again with my hubby
154306,164392,@VirginAmerica seems like that link is not working. Problem with the URL shortener. perhaps?
154310,164396,I left a book on my flight from Seattle to Minneapolis. Is there a lost and found? @deltaassist
154311,164397,@AmericanAir Hi! Owing to long wait times. res gives the option of a call-back. Sadly. each call-back just drops the call when answered. :-(
154316,164402,Omg... @SouthwestAir lost my bag from the OC and I'm flying out to Portland. I'm so stressed and a terrible way to start my Memorial Day wkd
154324,164411,Will never fly @JetBlue again
154326,164413,@DeltaAssist the bags were on the wrong belt.  Software issue or human error?  Many others were waiting as well...
154331,164418,If u thought flying couldn't get any worse. check out the Asian girl rapper in @VirginAmerica safety video. #virgin https://t.co/7PjrDXeUeD
154342,164429,@SouthwestAir shocker. now on the way home we r going to leave late. 3 delayed in a row.going to try for 4 on connector
154344,164431,@AmericanAir any chance of getting a number where you can help me and not hang up on me? Stuck in Chicago because of this...
154346,164433,@JetBlue you're really shitting the bed on this flight...how am I supposed to wait for 30 min for take off when my TV doesn't work? Cool
154347,164434,@SouthwestAir still disappointed in ur sorry attempt to replace $140 worth of stolen checked property with $75 flight voucher. Really?!
154351,164438,Lady who checked me in @JetBlue had a mechanical hand #inspiration
154352,164439,Delayed @united flight means I'm going to completely miss my husband's birthday. :(

154357,164444,@DeltaAssist why is flight DL2492 from PHX to DTW delayed?
154361,164448,@SouthwestAir I'm having a similar issue to this: Checked in on desktop. log into app and it says 'you still need a paper boarding pass'
154364,164452,Now I remember why I never fly @united. #clownairlines
154374,164462,I'm booked on a @united B757-300 to Orlando in July. Can't wait. Here's one rotating on Houston IAH RWY 15R #avgeek http://t.co/uziT211CI4

154386,164474,@DeltaAssist please don't let me miss my flight to Jackson I'm on the dl1110 from Mco!
154387,164475,@SouthwestAir #southwestairlines will leave you stranded without any compensation. You have a choice. choose another airline.
154395,164483,@united How long must we wait to get confirmation on our  last leg upgrade for CCMMSG? It's been months. Should we just use regional?
154403,164492,This is like the fourth tweet I've seen today about how terrible @AmericanAir is!!! lmao  https://t.co/cP5dVjefJ9
154414,164503,@JetBlue why do I have to wait longer in line to use the bag drop than going into the reg line when I've paid for extra speed? #frustrated
154416,164505,@JetBlue #jetblueflight469 delayed two hours. I will do my best to avoid #jetblue. you just lost my trust forever
154417,164506,This is the second time I've missed a connecting flight because @united was acting like a fool.
154426,164517,@united Was the Chicago flight at 6pm delayed by 2 hrs today? I fly to Chicago at 5:54pm tomorrow and have a connecting flight I can't miss.
154428,164519,@United after seeing the way you handle people with autism. I will never step foot on your airline #boycottunited
154431,164522,Is it just me or does @united club in SFO like to fry their guests with heat and no AC to get them to leave the club?
154432,164524,"The @SouthwestAir pilot on final approach: ""Please tell your friends that we arrived early. Because we know you tell them when we're late."""
154434,164526,Stuck in DC UA3979 mechanical @united what are the chances I get home tonight?

154464,164559,Guess who's @AmericanAir flight was canceled again? My hate for AA is breaking the roof. My kids will have to wait another day to see me.
154467,164562,We are on the plane and MAY leave earlier than they told us. By maybe 5 minutes. woo Hoo. @SouthwestAir though the bathrooms have NO water.
154471,164566,@AmericanAir Why did you just make me wait 80 minutes for a callback only to be transferred to another line to wait 16 more minutes on hold?
154472,164567,Getting really fed up w/ @united. If you're looking for different prices per phone call. they're the people to call... #irritated
154494,164590,@AlaskaAir thanks for ruining our weekend by delaying our flight for 6 hours. Great job.
154499,164595,7 min early into #IAD after leaving 20 min late from #DEN  on @SouthwestAir #takeoffsandlandings #sunset #wingtips http://t.co/slnO3F0dYv
154508,164605,I cannot stress enough how superior @SouthwestAir is to all other airlines. Especially after my experience I've had the last two days.
154519,164616,I became friends with the cute little 50 year old sisters on my flight. We laughed at @VirginAmerica's broken satellite a lot 
154522,164619,@united need two tickets to sfo earliest in the morning &amp; hotel for tonight!traveling with mom who is 65! You guys are so pathetic!
154523,164620,@united ua1550.  Got in early.  Trapped on plane thought because of a jetway problem.  You can't write this. #epicfail
154525,164622,@AlaskaAir after a terrible week of having to fly AA. I'm finally back in good hands at SEA Boardroom before my AS flight home. Love AS!
154537,164635,@united Lost my ID wallet on UA 1411 O'Hare to SFO in seat 7E. Hoping I am able to recover it.
154539,164637,@JetBlue not cool while entering my name and joining TrueBlue the price of my tickets which I was in process of buying increased by $20.
154548,164647,Geez @AlaskaAir can any of my flights be on time today? Maybe its time to stop running crews so lean customers bear the brunt of all issues
154555,164655,Turbulence may be ahead. See why @AmericanAir Forex did worse than expected. http://t.co/0c1G68oEMX #SmartTrader http://t.co/R4BRPyp1TV
154559,164659,Haven't taken off for the 1st leg of flight on @AlaskaAir out of SEA and I can say I'm not going to be a repeat customer. Late + rude = no.
154560,164660,@DeltaAssist I understand the cancellation. Not the sorry mess afterwards. I expect to NOT miss the new flight - I'm on time. you're not.
154566,164666,@united What happened to the automated system so much easier then having to wait to talk to someone
154569,164669,@JetBlue the ladies of flight 576 MSY -&gt; JFK were so incredible! Despite a 2+ hour delay the flight attendants were so positive &amp; kind!
154571,164671,@AlaskaAir No fun sitting at MSY w/ a baby for 7 hrs &amp; now flight Msy-sea is switched to tmrw. Fingers crossed the crew shows up this time!
154577,164677,Speed Thrills.. But kills too..Safety First..!  In association with @United Bike...: Speed ... http://t.co/zMQXdRqiAo #MangaloreMeriJaan
154578,164678,@AmericanAir I am using this phone - https://t.co/Wa2N3Aq99y - your US phone numbers are on long wait
154579,164679,Yay. Our @JetBlue plane is about 20 minutes late.
154580,164680,@DeltaAssist you guys are causing me so much money because of your delayed PNS2212 flight. I wasnt able to attend 2 shows in Manila!!!

154591,164691,@AlaskaAir Im scheduled to leave ONT tomorrow at 6 AM going to Seattle. Having a little issue... Can I get on 10 AM flight to Sea?
154592,164692,Why should I follow you @DeltaAssist? The time to assist me was at the airport. when all it would have taken was a fucking piece of paper.
154593,164693,Did you read the article about AA in USA today?  My thoughts are the same had flown for years. never again. @AmericanAir
154595,164695,Dear @JetBlue 2nd delayed flight this trip &amp; no explanation i used to find you reliable. Losing faith. Fast. http://t.co/CXA3DWR63g
154599,164699,@united This is very funny. I don't fear flying. I only fear Flying United. alas. It has been such a consistently disheartening experience.
154604,164704,What are you waiting for?! Get checked in for #HeartsBreakfastInAmerica!!  You could be on the @AmericanAir flight! http://t.co/Qim6NfmJ0o
154606,164706,@AmericanAir .. Must do better. It took my wife less time to fly from OKC to DFW than the time she's been waiting at the gate 
154624,164725,@AmericanAir one more time your fly in late from.Chicago to London..I'm very upset
154628,164729,Lori K @united employee at the #ORD checking area of terminal C. is very unfriendly. Day is starting &amp; she already has a bad attitude
154630,164731,1 Bad experience with @AmericanAir from #LasVegas to #NewYork . No first class lounge in vegas chair on the plane is not comfortable.
154634,164735,@JetBlue I'm on another airlines for once and miss you guys so much even before takeoff. Thank God I'm flying back with you.
154636,164737,Wait no assigned seats?! This is so weird @SouthwestAir
154650,164751,@DeltaAssist is there anyway to switch from flight 2433 to flight 1970 on standby w/o a fee?
154652,164753,Traveling home today...yeah! Been a long trip and missing @united again today! #airportlife
154655,164756,I. Hate. @AmericanAir. So. Fucking. Much.

154680,164782,Mahalo to the @united flight 1706 pilots for getting us to lax on time after leaving 45 minutes late. East coast bound now!
154681,164783,@SouthwestAir Is it true you no longer do nonstop flights to New York from Akron Canton Airport
154690,164792,Baby's first flight today @JetBlue !!! Can't wait to take the little man to the sunshinestate!

154704,164806,@DeltaAssist our sailing team is headed to Nationals in Chicago and we have been delayed here for over 3 hrs and no end in sight. Mechanical

154717,164820,@DeltaAssist jamming us onto the jetway to stand around for 25 minutes doesnt make the plane leave earlier.
154719,164822,@AmericanAir I'm having an issue merging accounts. I know my Dividend miles number but not the AA number they were transferred to and it
154729,164833,@AmericanAir can I fly home tomorrow even though I lost my license?
154731,164835,May miss my flight to DCA for being stuck on the Tarmac in #sea! Come on @AlaskaAir we can make it!
154735,164839,".@JetBlue is the WORST airline sit. Trying to reset your password is like breaking into f'n Ft. Knox. ""Can 't use lat TWENTY passwords""?!?!?"
154737,164841,@AlaskaAir why did flight 724 go out late? Everyone I. There seats than they start pulling people off???
154741,164845,@united never in my life traveling with you again
154742,164846,Two different flights to Miami cancelled. You are better off trying to build your own airplane than flying @AmericanAir .
154748,164853,@united Can't wait! my trip is booked. #traveling #vacation #summertimeshine #sky #clouds
154751,164856,@AmericanAir MISSED FLIGHT!! Mechanical issues with plane. Custer relations where are you!
154755,164860,Why did someone cancel my return flight without asking me? @SouthwestAir NEVER AGAIN.

154781,164886,@DeltaAssist Hello. I am a Delta customer who loves flying Delta &amp; has spent thousands traveling internationally &amp; domestic. I have an issue
154793,164898,OK; flight cancelled @AlaskaAir 718. may not make it to Cabo til tomorrow
154794,164899,kinda disappointed that @AlaskaAir has gone this route too. always liked that the seats were all reasonable.
154800,164906,@AmericanAir Can't wait to fly on your new Dreamliner tonight!
154802,164908,"@AmericanAir I was supposed to receive a ""substantive response"" to my DOT complaint re: Beijing fare on Mon. AA delayed. When is it coming?"
154805,164911,day 2 of your guys overbooking bullshit @SouthwestAir
154807,164913,Hey @DeltaAssist any way to move my row up?  I am stuck in 33 in a few hours and want to make my little girls school event. Better up front.
154816,164922,@united maintenance issue and have mechanics on board. Then get this email. Which is it - weather or mechanical? http://t.co/mcyXXNIcgQ
154817,164923,@AmericanAir How do I contact lost &amp; found for the airline? I think I lost my eyeglasses on my last flight. and I need them.
154833,164939,Thanks for screwing me over @JetBlue
154835,164941,@AmericanAir so. how do I locate my lost iPod??  5.20.15 AA44. CDG??
154841,164947,Avoided the 220 dollar baggage fee and my camera works. Stop trying to destroy my wallet @united :/
154842,164948,Is it just me or do the #slc @SouthwestAir folks act like they hate their job?! Seriously some are so  #FriendlyAggravated! #happyday #SB
154861,164968,@JetBlue My app is broken! It wouldn't let me check in so I checked in on the browser and now it won't let me see my boarding pass! (1/2)
154871,164978,@JetBlue I'm experiencing some mobile app timeout issues when searching for flights. Are you guys aware or is this a one off?
154886,164995,I'll call it the LGA wedding curse. #AA1471 #stuck #notagain @AmericanAir http://t.co/WjG85NzA2z
154900,165009,@united it's ok for now. Going to board a new flight in a few mins and hopefully this plane isn't having issues
154907,165017,@AmericanAir Any more London flight/vacation promos coming?  Missed out on last 1 as I waited for my AA credit card in mail.
154911,165022,@AmericanAir I have emailed a long letter to you. Because of AA. my parents suffered. I was awake until 4 AM to follow up with your office
154918,165030,GUYS sorry if we're late/have broken instruments. @united are being so terrible to us it's almost funny  Cover idea: http://t.co/hcIXMe3EBh
154920,165032,Is @AlaskaAir trying to fudge the delay time by saying we're boarding flight 305 out of SFO when everyone's still coming off the plane?
154930,165042,@JetBlue nope. they haven't announced any solution to the problem and it's been at least 30 mins. flight is from JFK-FLL
154944,165056,Haha. What happened? And don't ease up on @United email them your complaints. Lol  https://t.co/Fi1ZfL7ZoE
154946,165058,Maybe I will switch full time to @united. Better run anyway.
154948,165060,@VirginAmerica truly appalled by your agents at DAL today. I'm bailing on this party in the sky FOR GOOD. #badcustomerservice
154949,165061,@SouthwestAir you lost a loyal customer today who only flies SWA in the U.S. Exactly how many early bird check ins are you selling? B28&amp;C2??
154953,165065,stuck! whenever I click select. it shows fare not available. and I went beack and search again and same thing happened! help!@AmericanAir
154955,165067,@DeltaAssist  no flights available. had to book a flight on Southwest. can you comp cost? Not a normal partner airline
154960,165072,I must be on @AmericanAir bad side. This is the 3rd flight with no window  http://t.co/cjcVZpO6xY
154965,165077,Literally sprinted from B12 to A7 to try and catch an earlier @SouthwestAir flight to ORF. Just missed it and now my 3.5 layover begins.
154968,165080,@JetBlue  you tell me. flight delayed 1h 30m. then 3h now 3h  10m. Last time I flew you canceled. Going to again?
154969,165081,@DeltaAssist Not baggage issue. We had to buy another ticket on a differnt airline and missed 2 days of pre-paid scuba b/c of check in error
154982,165096,Hi @JetBlue a nice lady asked if I wanna switch seats so she can sit next to her granddaughter. How do I say no without looking like a dick?
154983,165097,I miss our random talks @VirginAmerica Hope you have been well. Don't be a stranger! I'm not far from LAX. http://t.co/veuJDABCCK
154996,165114,@JetBlue hi I've been on hold from the UK for 20 minutes...! Have you all gone to lunch??
155000,165118,2 days... 2 flights .... 2 flights without @SouthwestAir wifi what the heck!!?? #firstworldproblems
155006,165125,@AmericanAir tks for letting us 12h in the airport of Turks&amp;Caicos waiting for our plane to be fixed.
155019,165139,@JetBlue plays some decent tunes when they put you on hold.
155025,165145,@JetBlue I might kill myself on this flight. I'm next to a loud and grabby baby and the mutual armrest has the controls for my seat.
155037,165157,Norma is re-telling her horror story with @SouthwestAir back in 2008!
155043,165164,.@AmericanAir Stop emailing me you fucking psycho. http://t.co/PsW1uU30Q6
155049,165170,Why would @AmericanAir prefer to leave a seat empty vs. letting me switch to earlier flight? Said I couldn't because not an 'elite' flyer.
155051,165172,Wait. @SouthwestAir doesn't support Apple Watch but United. Alaska Air. and every other airline I use does? I... I don't understand.
155057,165179,@JetBlue thanks for making a delayed flight back to being on schedule. Always my fav airline!
155059,165181,"Slow clap for @SouthwestAir ...you guys have this whole ""check in"" thing down. #expressbagdrop"
155066,165190,Just won a free movie voucher waiting for a delayed flight on @VirginAmerica. Thanks for being such a fun airline! Always a treat!
155068,165192,@SouthwestAir just landed in Detroit. But flight attendants made us throw away our drinks. boo. Waste of money :(
155080,165205,@JetBlue really?! This flight sucked with the blinking screen the whole trip. #broken #seizures http://t.co/uU3tzL4eTB
155082,165207,@DeltaAssist if the upgrade to first class in a flight that has none is the best you got. please DON'T BOTHER! #Notsoloyalcustomeranymore
155091,165217,@SouthwestAir just ruined a second flight for my sister and bro in law- and parents this time! Now they might not get to go to Disney World
155095,165221,Never in my life will I fly @SouthwestAir again. Can't do it.
155098,165224,Ugh ultra drunk couple in next row over on my @VirginAmerica 2 LA. Please let them fall asleep. #VirginAmerica they've been over-served.
155104,165230,@AmericanAir ITS HERE I CANT WAIT http://t.co/gV99YxUt8X
155105,165232,@JetBlue Broken TV in Seat 15A on flight 1730 -no problem.Flight attendants move me to working set with Rangers game on in exit row. THANKS!
155115,165243,Waiting for the day that @SouthwestAir will list Kingston. Jamaica as a port!
155121,165249,This just happened. @SouthwestAir gave our plane heading to DCA to an LA bound flight. They are now flying home and I'm stuck at MSY.
155131,165260,@JetBlue why do u always delay my flight?
155133,165262,PSA: the back row seats of @VirginAmerica don't recline. so don't expect to be at all comfortable if you get stuck in the back!!! #thxvirgin
155134,165263,@united an informal poll of folks with whom I stand in the utter chaos your boarding process is overwhelming negative.
155141,165271,@VirginAmerica lost some points with me today 
155148,165278,I'm going to fucking chuck my flip flop at one of your workers faces @SouthwestAir
155151,165281,@AlaskaAir really does take care of their customers. Thank you for resolving an issue and upgrading me to first class on the spot.
155156,165286,Fourth @united flight in a row that is delayed NOT bc of weather. Can't wait for high speed rail to destroy this industry. &gt;:(
155160,165290,@AmericanAir Every experience=negative. Late flights. missed connections. switching us 2 other flights w/o confirming. overbooked. DISASTER
155169,165300,@AmericanAir Is there something wrong with http://t.co/Ad1L9D994x? For 20 mins I keep getting errors/get kicked off trying book a flight.
155170,165301,@DELTAASSIST flight to ATL arriving late (mechanical). I have a connecting flight to Shreveport. Can DL 5345 wait for me?
155179,165312,.@united Sad to see the MSY &gt; SFO direct flight disappear  I take that flight often and have to look elsewhere now _
155184,165318,5hr delay. $100xtra bagfee. moved from pref seating to econ. now I traveled back in time to 70s- Come on @AmericanAir http://t.co/N8tWmnqie4
155187,165322,@united I'm in Norfolk Va.  3 aircraft landed at the same time.  I've been waiting for my bags for 1/2.  Please tell me united has &gt; 1 brew
155192,165327,@SouthwestAir nightmare flights - never anyone to talk to. Let it be known I can't determine I have a seat so won't be checking in tomorrow.
155194,165329,@americanair your pricing controls are shameful. Canadian airports should cancel your privilege to take our money.
155205,165341,DON'T FLY @AlaskaAir . They go back on promises &amp; when you're in a bad situation they would rather defer responsibility than offer support.
155206,165342,Wait is @AlaskaAir a customer-facing account or not?
155216,165352,"When you say ""once again"" @JetBlue . that implies the statement is being repeated. First time anyone's heard your flight to FLL is late #LAX"
155218,165354,@SouthwestAir my bad didn't make it on an 1:20 flight from Dallas to New Orleans........really 
155221,165357,@united what have I done for you to hate me so much? I try to defend you but twice in a row no luggage from EWK to PHX? No more. New airline
155229,165365,.@AmericanAir atypical flight 218 from SFO that doesn't reflect your brand. Your system crashed. and switched me from an aisle to a middle 
155253,165391,Frontier airlines suuuuucks. #neveragain I miss you @SouthwestAir
155255,165394,@AmericanAir why get everyone on the aircraft  and then tell us that there waiting for apart this on flight 819 phx to indy .
155256,165395,@SouthwestAir why don't you fly to knoxville you're killing me here
155284,165424,As much as I love @JetBlue today's experience has been a nightmare. Booking with a partner airline (Hawaiian) is not a good experience.
155286,165426,@VirginAmerica Not traveling after this experience.Throw away a suitcase!? Next day have the standby fight leave early while stuck in TSA
155287,165428,so @SouthwestAir says my plane can't go because a bird dented it...? at least come up with a better excuse... that's just weak
155292,165433,@AmericanAir who is running US Airways at CVG? Had to have multiple flights cut to front because badly understaffed.
155294,165435,@united I am very dissatisfied with your service today. Cliff L. and Alexa F. were very disrespectful to us and we are extremely offended.
155295,165436,Waiting on a @JetBlue plane because they don't have clearance for route. Why organize things. after all? #jetbluefail #jetblue
155297,165438,"@AmericanAir just announced""potty is broken"" go before you board. #AmericanAirdoesnotcare!"
155319,165460,I appreciate @JetBlue getting me to New York safely though. What was the reason for the delay?
155322,165463,@AmericanAir your airline has made my morning very unpleasant.
155326,165467,@AmericanAir forced to planeside chk TrvelPro tho fits perfectly. Pull handle destroyed. #HowTheF #Animals http://t.co/OKKs9ruVOQ
155336,165477,@DeltaAssist ugh just created my boarding pass and realized it doesn't include my pre-check info. Anything I can do? _
155340,165481,@AmericanAir OK. Upset again. Bags did not make it to Nassau last night. Claim made. Form does not have number to call internationally. Need
155342,165483,Do you think my fish (that I left in Columbus) is mad at me? Should I have brought it on the plane? Is that allowed @JetBlue? #replytweet
155344,165485,@JetBlue loved Punta Cana... Until we had to wait over an hour to check into our flight
155364,165508,@AmericanAir go wake up the flight attendant.  US1898 can't leave Seattle!
155370,165514,The moment when you just keep pressing 0 to try and reach a real person @AmericanAir #Frustrated #MileMergeProbs #USAIR

155420,165569,@AmericanAir I am an Executive Platinum with America and fly every week. Every time I fly US Airways. the planes are old and always an issue
155429,165578,S/O to the @SouthwestAir Crew of Flight 1791 for their professionalism and keeping passengers relaxed during a stressful situation!
155432,165581,I hate #lax and @AmericanAir #nocustomerservice

155467,165617,I haven't flown @JetBlue in ages &amp; forgot how much better of an experience it is. And this on an otherwise crappy trip. so I appreciate it.
155471,165621,@DeltaAssist bag took longer than 20 minutes to come out
155473,165624,Stuck like chuck @AmericanAir #86ptoday
155474,165625,@JetBlue I was a passenger on 0431 that suffered immense distress from the passengers in row 18.
155514,165668,@JetBlue - It was even worse the 2nd time around! Please take us back! We promise to stay #trueblue We still want #allthebluechipsyoucaneat
155516,165670,@AmericanAir no. flt is set. Just remarking that cust serv is bad everytime I fly. Esp at DFW. which welcomes many int'l pax #embarrassing.
155518,165672,@united you make exceptions for musical instruments though. is there any way I could obtain an exception if I make sure nobody is bothered?
155521,165675,@VirginAmerica Oh and you never upgraded me to Gold. Ever. Sadly.
155527,165681,".@SouthwestAir 1162 due to land 5:20. still waiting at 5:45? App shows ""on time"" What's the definition of on time?"

155542,165698,@JetBlue what's up with the booking fees when you try to get a flight at the airport soo annoying
155565,165722,Hoping my upcoming PS flights run smoother than my last trip to JFK and saddened to hear @united killed off compassion fares. #harsh
155571,165728,@AmericanAir  CMH to DFW this afternoon. First aid kit made us miss flight to BRO. Irritating.
155577,165735,@AmericanAir yeeees unfortunately she's missing lots of birthday plans tonight  We are AA2353
155584,165744,@united Issue resolved!
155599,165759,@AmericanAir blew it big time on AA5692. Sent plane with no soap in bathroom and insultingly disinterested crew.

155608,165769,@United my family and I have been waiting for 45 mins at baggage claim at MCO. this is getting kinda old
155609,165770,Hey @united Check out my tale of first class airfare gone bad.  http://t.co/UfmhQf9zob
155618,165779,@DeltaAssist it wasn't. The original problem was something with your plane. It just so happened that then afterwards there was a storm
155620,165781,Sad to find out that I can't use Passbook for my upcoming @SouthwestAir flight just because I have other people flying with me. Like what?
155635,165796,@AmericanAir I lost all my prescription medications. but I'm not sure if it fell out on my flights or in the airports. What do I do?

155669,165831,@AmericanAir cross Ts. dot Is. and don't act like running all over an airport based on YOUR info is the passengers fault. It's basic.
155674,165836,@united Hi. I just received an email about a schedule change. I booked this flight because it was less time to wait in the airport... (1/2)
155675,165837,.@AlaskaAir gets you to your destination cheap. no fuss. But they could be less stingy with the honey mustard pretzels. #SuchTinyPackages
155676,165838,There's an outlet and USB port under my seat and I have a TV remote. I'm never not flying @VirginAmerica again.  #PainlessinSeattle

156975,167219,@VirginAmerica pre-flight video w/ ridiculous song is beyond annoying. the Glee club rendition how to buckle a seatbelt will tear us apart
156976,167220,Kicking myself for not discovering @JetBlue #TrueBlueBadges before this year. But at least I've earned 25 badges since Feb. so there is that
156993,167237,What happened to @SouthwestAir ?  Used to be better than the rest. NOT ANY MORE. Late. Over Capacity.  Checking carry-ons. Good-Bye.
156998,167242,Broken jetway means late for work. :( @AlaskaAir
157011,167256,Leave it to @AmericanAir to fly  MD-80s to an important hub like Chicago but soon to fly an A321 to a rival airport like Houston
157015,167260,Flew @SouthwestAir for the first time ever. And they lost my luggage. You could say today is not the best day.
157023,167268,on the way to DR. @AmericanAir had a commercial saying in the near future their planes will let you lie down completely flat . trippy _

157100,167356,Hmmmm. last week an unfriendly crew and this week @SouthwestAir lost my bag. We're not doing too hot guys...
157104,167361,@AmericanAir I am trying to claim missing miles. Yet ticket #'s are 13 digits. yet the form only accepts 10 digits. http://t.co/w406XXithN
157113,167370,@DeltaAssist are there fees to cancel a flight?
157118,167375,Everyone tweets bad things about airlines. so I'll take a moment to say @AlaskaAir handled a situation real well today.
157132,167390,@AmericanAir Come on now I landed 30 mins ago &amp; I'm still on this plane. If I'm late to my for flight I'm gonna need an upgrade to 1st class
157137,167396,@AmericanAir as stated before. I mailed and emailed my complaint last month. Feeling like I'm getting the run around again.
157142,167401,Question for @united - Flight 5918 is scheduled to leave Chicago on time at 3:29. but arrive in Cleveland an hour late. Any reason for this?
157150,167409,@united. have a flight from LAS to BWI via IAH on Friday. Problems still expected for then &amp; suggested to call and change route if possible?
157151,167410,@SouthwestAir your jerking me around like never before!

157172,167432,@SouthwestAir Yeah. it was a bad day. I did finally make it to NOLA (6 hours later than expected). Mother Nature just ate a vacay day.
157180,167440,I feel bad for the outbound @VirginAmerica  JFK flight at LAX because some irate man was causing a huge scene in the terminal.
157181,167441,@AmericanAir how likely is it that the flights into Houston tomorrow will be on time or not cancelled?
157185,167446,@AmericanAir I flew +300K miles with constant delays and mechanical failures. Once I made my 1st complaint you just say: I'm sorry?#shameaa
157192,167453,@DeltaAssist... 27 minute wait time to ask a question about a flight I'm trying to book? I'll time out of your website before you get to me!
157193,167454,@AmericanAir _how you moved all the men into 1st before the female who has status. disrespectful. to pull the men 1st. After 2 day delay...
157209,167470,Took the #callback option when faced with a 24-34 minute wait time for an @AmericanAir rep; they called back. put me on hold and hung up.
157211,167472,@DeltaAssist I want to book an int'l flight (DCA-NRT) using my wife's miles but my credit card for the fee.She is not going. Problems?
157214,167475,@DeltaAssist I should be earning miles for sitting here waiting. especially since it feels like the AC is broken at GSP! #travelproblems
157217,167478,9hrs. 3 delayed flights. 2 rebookings &amp; a missed flight to London due to a 'bathroom door issue.'  @united -consistently late &amp; unempathetic

157256,167519,@AmericanAir - it was such a mess at DCA this afternoon as we were ushered into bus only to wait in the heat. View: http://t.co/N3ex4Vslbo
157258,167521,@DeltaAssist its gonne be close. wait for me!
157260,167523,So now airlines are trying to make money be charging fees for early check in. Really? Is it that bad? @SouthwestAir
157267,167531,"This is why I try to always fly @JetBlue. I don't any preboarding problems &amp; they never ask if I'm ""really disabled"" https://t.co/2PSP2oX3i0"
157274,167539,@united Please keep 5pm daily nonstop MCI-IAD. Sad to see it was just a temp addition. as an early pm nonstop is definitely needed!

157762,168045,Can't wait to get an answer from @VirginAmerica for my Bachelor Thesis!This is gonna be 100 points for sure! #excited #BT #airlines #passion
157767,168050,@SouthwestAir We're feeling the LUV from #Dallas here in #Charleston and can't wait for daily flights!
157773,168056,The canned music @United plays while client is on hold must be intended to drive the traveler to the website. #excruciating
157785,168069,I have used @JetBlue &amp; then i used another airline. horrible experience. I dont want to use their name so lets just call them Delta airlines
157791,168075,Middle seat on the flight to NYC. Not as bad as expected so far.... Better hope it starys this way. @JetBlue
157794,168078,Every time I end up flying @United I vow it will be the last time. and this time I mean. So sick of being stuck in Texas.
157796,168080,@JetBlue this is how it__s done! _Delta pilot orders pizza for delayed flight_ http://t.co/J4pFe5v3zk
157812,168097,@AmericanAir It wasn't so much the weather. but the disorganization and overall lack of hustle as we waited for the diverted planes to fuel.
157815,168100,@DeltaAssist that's what they keep saying as they tell us it gets longer and longer.
157838,168124,@AmericanAir Why is catering just showing up to a flight that was supposed to leave at 10:10?
157842,168128,@DeltaAssist Hi. Flights were cancelled yesterday. and I have bag that is booked to Knoxville. Want to make sure it gets there. l
157845,168131,Mad props to @AlaskaAir yesterday who let us board first out of Ketchikan w/our child w/autism.He loves flying. standing in line not so much
157846,168132,Boarding delayed for @united 5900 Syracuse to Chicago O'Hare because temp sensor malfunctional causing cabin temperature to fluctuate
157849,168136,So glad that @united didn't see this coming a mile away and move quickly to stem a 2 hour delay. Now going to miss both of my interviews.
157854,168141,Will never fly @JetBlue. Cost me 1st day of my honeymoon without even setting foot on plane. Disorganized. bumbling. #clueless
157859,168146,I hope the 4th set of mechanics can replace- er. repair our plane. Fingers crossed. @united
157873,168162,@AmericanAir know what's going on with flight 242 out of SFO?? Don't want to miss my connecting flight in Chicago!!
157883,168172,@united my lost luggage from USA needed to go from DELHI to GOA (me)... computer says it's gone from Kolkata to Mumbai ?? file #DEL14268M
157886,168175,To bad @united didn't do this for us yesterday!!! #missedloyalty http://t.co/fNry40ua07
157894,168183,@SouthwestAir  if i switch my flights and the new flight is cheaper does the money saved stay in my rapid rewards for use on a new ticket ?
157900,168189,@AlaskaAir yes! Can't wait to check out your local booze selection on board! Cheers!
157909,168199,@SouthwestAir take notes. Why couldn't this have happened to me last week when my flight was stuck for a light cover? http://t.co/i5n53jnKkd
157910,168200,It took @VirginAmerica over a week to replace my credit card that I reported lost when I got the package it was 2day delivery. Hmm
157918,168210,@JetBlue You are having a problem with your website.  I cannot see flight choices. #maybedelta #maybeunited
157922,168214,3 flights cancelled in last 3 trips. i'm about to start taking it personally @SouthwestAir :~)
157923,168216,@DeltaAssist I've been on hold 20+ minutes - what is going on? What happened to callback option?

157935,168229,@AmericanAir my mum may have lost an earring on one of your flights from UK to Dallas USA a few weeks ago. If found where would it end up?
157946,168240,Thanks @VirginAmerica for the smooth flight. I never get tired of the safety vid! #safetydance
157950,168244,Not at all impressed with my @SouthwestAir flight experience today. Never thought I'd say that. 
157961,168255,Sad that @AmericanAir kiosk no longer offers to add me to upgrade waitlist on Avios award...

157973,168267,@united Hi. need some help...First leg of my flight was cancelled and I can't load a boarding pass for the second. Not sure what to do...
157974,168268,"Sometimes don't like total transparency. @united telling I'm going to miss my connection because of ""a broken lightbulb"" for example :)"
157975,168269,The huge increase in consumer complaints about @United and other airlines is why our nation needs high speed rail. #hsrail
157993,168287,. @SouthwestAir Cancelled flight from Newark to Chicago and zero answers... What's the deal?
157994,168288,@united the only thing I can give you is leave on the 5/29/15 9:44am name is Brian desantell
157998,168294,@DeltaAssist will need to speak with someone in ireland re: mess up w/infant tix FLL-SNN &amp; avoiding same SNN-FLL 5/29. Best number to call?
157999,168295,@SouthwestAir I'm trying to get a LUV voucher issue resolved I've been calling 2149320333 and getting a busy signal. Anyway you can help?
158002,168298,@SouthwestAir Never flying Southwest again. been a loyal customer for years. no longer. #SouthwestAirlines #SouthwestAirlinessucks

158036,168335,UA 1002 marks my last vacation screwed up by @united and this will be the last time I fly with them. Stranded in sfo. Should be on a beach.
158038,168337,Hi. @JetBlue. My flight is delayed. I'm not complaining. but I do have a question! Do your planes have two horns?
158048,168347,@JetBlue Just booked our flight to Puerto Rico! Can't wait and Jet Blue is our favorite airliner so a win-win! 
158056,168355,@SouthwestAir it's too late for that. You failed me.
158068,168368,@SouthwestAir Why was flight 409 from PIT to TPA cancelled today?
158071,168371,@SouthwestAir flight cancelled into BWI today &amp; helpdesk tells me no flights into BWI all day - check website. lies.
158079,168379,@AmericanAir the flight board near K1 has a problem with one of the monitors.
158084,168384,@JetBlue ... We should have shut the doors &amp; left when we done boarding. 2:46 now stuck on Tarmac waiting our turn to take off. Oy!
158087,168388,@JetBlue usually I use twitter to contact airlinIies for flight issues. but this time I just had to say thank you for being so great!
158089,168390,@SouthwestAir my boy Adam said he ain't never scared of a nigga that breathes the same air as him. and he wants the cypher
158098,168399,Praying to the airline gods that we'll make both of our connections home on @united tonight. Such bad flight luck lately!
158100,168401,@DeltaAssist My Delta flight was cancelled and I was switched to a non-partner airline.  What happens to the miles I would have earned?
158105,168406,Due to have my first flight with @JetBlue but they have cancelled my flight and it's now tomorrow. Not sure where I can sleep..!
158119,168420,@AmericanAir I just flew all the way from Sydney to DFW. my connector is delayed. Any chance of getting me in the admirals club for a bit?
158122,168423,@AmericanAir are liars because they don't apply their promise.
158123,168424,@AmericanAir how early can I check baggage for a flight if I want to leave the airport and come back later to check in (to save time later)?
158125,168426,Just had a great customer service experience with Julie from @JetBlue. It's nice when an airline handles a delay with compassion!
158134,168435,@AmericanAir I'm going to assume I have to call customer service again? You told me to wait for quite some time now. This is back from Feb.
158147,168448,@DeltaAssist Have you guys cancelled your non-stop flight JFK-PAP? Trying to book a flight for... 1/2
158150,168451,Waiting for a log book on @AmericanAir so we can fly. Wait for it... Wait for it ... *--)-   *--)-   *--)-   #NoZoomiesYet
158152,168453,@SouthwestAir no longer following the number system at LaGuardia. Should we all just cut in when we want?
158163,168466,@united we buy four tickets-get threw get confirmation number-next thing you see boom-no email and lost conformation (NO MONEY LOST LUCKLY)
158170,168473,@DeltaAssist guys...abandoned me in Dallas and nearly missed my flight. Now there are five wheelchair passengers (and 4 chairs) stuck. What?
158171,168474,@DeltaAssist flight delayed from MSP-JFK means I'm probably gonna miss my JFK-MAD flight tonight (DL414). What are my options?
158172,168475,If I never flew @united again. I wouldn't be mad!! #worsttripever
158188,168494,@DeltaAssist just want to get home to NY LGA from Nashville. Hoping you don't cancel my flight like all the others tonight.
158213,168520,@JetBlue Any idea why our flight from MSY -&gt; JFK tonight is cancelled? (Flight 576) How do we claim back airfare?
158235,168542,@DeltaAssist i am missing my miles from  DFW to AMS and AAL
158240,168547,@americanair trying to get missing miles for US flight last month. Online form has max digits at 10 for eticket#. my eticket# has 11 digits
158247,168554,Flight delay status; people are wondering around the airport claiming territory and power sources. We have two. will barter later. @JetBlue
158248,168555,@SouthwestAir Why did you board Flight #1182 if you knew it was going to be delayed again? Unacceptable. http://t.co/qLIoBAKdls
158251,168558,.@AmericanAir social team killing it as always with the #HiltonSocial team!
158264,168571,@JetBlue. good job. Finally found my bag after 12 days and destroyed it. Way to add insult to injury. http://t.co/wGwgFyn2uY

158293,168601,I feel you. was almost kicked off a @SouthwestAir flight a few years ago for being large. Luckily 2nd ticket bought. https://t.co/v9k0LUbcQB
158302,168611,@DeltaAssist another delay. Yesterday was weather today there is no excuse.
158310,168619,At the Nevada Tourism party to celebrate @jetblue's first JFK to Reno flight tomorrow! Here's a faux cowboy campfire! http://t.co/lLDCqJWiA1
158316,168625,This is unbelievably bad @united. Disgusting.  https://t.co/CWECSLGakC
158329,168638,For shame. The @JetBlue terminal in BOS is missing a championship banner. http://t.co/Jh4N11MuqU
158330,168640,Hi @AmericanAir--it looks like my delayed flight will cause me to miss my connection tonight. Any way I can try to switch carriers at all?
158331,168641,@JetBlue great airline. my flight to #SanDiego was comfortable bummer there was no wifi 
158336,168646,_ @VirginAmerica _ We'll never forget the first time we flew by. Happy 78th Anniversary! What's you...: We'll... http://t.co/mpaREFcSAc
158337,168648,Because @AmericanAir #FAIL I'm stuck in CHI tonight (not weather. or mechanical) so I won't be on-air tom... I'll have a lot to say Friday!
158347,168659,.@DeltaAssist Tell 6269 from LGA to GRR to wait for us! We're stuck in MCO waiting for the weather to clear in NY :(
158351,168664,I'm literally in the plane. We're still boarding. Don't lie to me. @united http://t.co/RGxMri0Cc3
158353,168667,".@JetBlue. this 4hr delay from CHS to JFK is not cool. Grouchy crowd just watched a Delta flight take off. so ""weather"" doesn't cut it."
158355,168669,"@united you best get me to San Francisco by noon tomorrow. after you cancelled my flight from MSP tomorrow AM for ""maintenance"""
158357,168671,And that there were later flights leaving for LA from @AmericanAir if we did miss our connection. I specifically asked.
158358,168672,@SouthwestAir ok what's the excuse now flight 683 from CMH.
158360,168674,@SouthwestAir Flight 1324 out Fort Lauderdale is delayed for four hours!  #RidiculusDelay
158369,168683,And I thought @JetBlue could do me no wrong. I hate that you proved me wrong 
158393,168709,@DeltaAssist 719. Too little too late.
158399,168716,why is the crew to poorly dressed ? @united
158412,168729,@JetBlue is killing me right now 
158415,168732,@AmericanAir disappointed app won't work with iOS 7 on my 4s iPhone.  can't use ios8 or latest app version on 4s. Forced 2print pass.

158436,168754,@SouthwestAir I'm on a flight to WPB and wanted to watch the hockey game but no wifi;( can I get a drink on the house to solve my problem?
158442,168760,Is there any chance that @AmericanAir #3906 will be cancelled from #phl to #dca ? It just moved from 9:35 to 11 pm.
158444,168762,@VirginAmerica I was  12 (late 1970s) and my mom's bf lost both side mirrors of our motor home trying to squeeze through the toll gates.
158453,168771,Dude next to me spent the entire flight to Chicago watching/seat dancing to Beyonc. Miley. and Shakira videos.  It was awful. @DeltaAssist
158459,168778,@AmericanAir don't think it was completely my fault that we missed the cut off time for checking bags.
158462,168781,@United kicked a pregnant woman and her 2 years old son off the plane because he was crying... OUTRAGEOUS! https://t.co/59BHT6KAUn
158487,168807,@DeltaAssist I have a credit so they said I have to call to use it but the wait time is very long. Any way to do this online?
158509,168830,When @united makes your best friend cry in the airport &lt;&lt;&lt; #notcool
158513,168834,@United is there no longer cart service between #SAN and #SFO - regular flight with #1405. not bumpy
158538,168872,@AmericanAir is there a $200 change fee for all non-refundable tix? I had to cancel a $150 flight. so now is that $150 lost?
158542,168876,Visited 2nd @AmericanAir Admirals Club I've never been to before today....
158550,168885,@VirginAmerica I've never experienced your great flights but I have yet to hear anything negative! I wish you flew into Denver... Just sayin
158561,168896,I KNEW IT @AmericanAir flight canceled. stuck in Chicago until tomorrow....
158577,168915,Still getting hung up on by @AmericanAir when I call CS.  Hate them.  Wish I had gone with another airline when racking up miles.
158579,168917,This mercury retrograde was being so good to me until tonight...This @JetBlue flight delay is out of control. Very unpleasant experience. 
158585,168924,How would you feel if @united puts you on a hold for 20 mins and then in the end the call goes blank? No music; just silence.
158590,168931,Bad day of flying. Finding solace reading @united hate tweets. Because people. I feel you.
158606,168948,Spending all my money lately on @JetBlue ... I'm not even mad.
158612,168955,@VirginAmerica free food or beer for this delayed SF flight?
158622,168966,@AlaskaAir Already did. Now waiting on a partner airline to complete the trip. YYC-SEA (presently) PHI next. then BWI http://t.co/rPCFIt1fnq
158627,168971,No. That's not okay! @united this is a Baby!! Gosh #discrimination #babiescry  https://t.co/6ZpqmQcCKw
158636,168980,Just awful. A to Z! @United coming soon! coin operated toilets and hourly rates for seat belts. Try to remember PASSENGERS pay your salary.
158642,168986,@AlaskaAir Defining moment for an airline is what they do when things go wrong. AS 239 was cancelled. and staff refused to accommodate 1/2
158651,168995,Protip @united if you anticipate an ETOPS refile BEFORE it expires you can prevent further delay. crew time out. and pissed off folks #UA104
158652,168996,Although after reading some of the nonsense people tweet @DeltaAssist. I think I'll pipe down.
158656,169000,@AlaskaAir missed the 20 minute window on bags from flight 19
158657,169001,@DeltaAssist Bag lost . we still have a hope . what should I wear now ?  This is my first day in Las Vegas  so mad http://t.co/gqOSZ4TM59
158675,169020,@DeltaAssist SO furious over $200 charge to flight change. NEVER fly delta again! Will tell EVERYONE to do the same.
158677,169023,.@JetBlue someone keeps stinking up the plane with their farts. I would love for this issue to be resolved so I can have a nice flight
158679,169025,@JetBlue why you so late? I want to stab myself. #itssuperlate #getmeouttahere
158694,169041,@AmericanAir there seems to be a TV missing from my seat in the 279 from EDI. I'm not a Neanderthal what's happened? http://t.co/7dE9c53XK4
158697,169044,@united #singer Sarah Blackwood needs an explanation. This is insane. bad marketing strategy! http://t.co/Pz31Rc0zQc
158700,169047,"@united have quite an ironic company name. It sure doesn't sound like they are ""united"" when they're kicking a pregnant woman off a plane!"
158709,169056,Just landed @SouthwestAir flight to Seattle was delayed _. Finally home 
158712,169059,@united Really? Kicking a 7 month pregnant mother off the flight because her toddler was crying? Your staff should be ashamed of themselves
158717,169065,@VirginAmerica was a rough redeye flight Maybe should cut off the passenger next to us with drinks so he could let us sleep and not smell
158728,169077,too bad @JetBlue wasn't helpful with honoring a ticket price. Guess I will have to fly with another airline from now on.

158759,169109,Any suggestions? Stuck in San Antonio trying to change airline ticket. @AmericanAir charges over $450 to change #justtryingtogethome
158774,169126,This is bullshit. it's my second time flying @VirginAmerica &amp; still no impromptu concert by any of the Black Eyed Peas!
158780,169132,Nothing like being on the 1st @AmericanAir flight out and having a windshield issue. If only they had all night to fix it...oh wait...
158782,169134,@AmericanAir can't wait to experience it!

158792,169144,@deltaassist the app let me down today. Made me miss my flight.
158797,169149,@united delayed again. reliability is a big issue. Do I need to travel days in advance to ensure I make meetings on time when flying United?
158799,169151,Can't fathom what @united was doing turning a plane around to kick off a pregnant mom &amp; 2yr old - For a child crying https://t.co/B1vweoHHIQ
158803,169156,@AmericanAir-On a 2-day. 8 flight trip. 3 of first 6 flights delayed. Trying to stay loyal. What are the odds of going 50/50 rest of trip?
158807,169160,Leave it to @AmericanAir to attempt to monetize a tweet in regard to their lack of hospitable legroom on flights.
158809,169162,@DeltaAssist unless more bag drop counters are opened for DL636. my guess is that lots of folks in this line will miss the flight
158811,169164,@united how about the woman kicked off the plane with a crying baby for god sake! !  A baby. They do cry.
158820,169173,Not gonna lie... Times like these makes me miss @VirginAmerica  sorry for cheating on you.

162817,173404,@JetBlue what's going on in NYC that our flight keeps getting delayed and now it's looking to be an overnight stay here at the airport
162821,173408,Don't miss @United's robotic. tone deaf non-apology #unitedfortahera http://t.co/bLXdcGc4pn
162828,173416,It seems as if I never got my answer a year and a half ago.  What music did @AmericanAir use on this video? https://t.co/qcq9Zlr5sN
162849,173438,"Here we are. waiting for @united to do ""maintenance"" on the plane's seats. #badtiming #2hoursofdelay #idontlike2wait #iamgoing2missmyflight"

162897,173487,@united since when is it okay to sell someone a seat within a foot of the lavatory entrance door? Disgusting. http://t.co/C4cy04fp7D
162900,173490,Seriously a two hour wait? trying to find my credit and use it for a new ticket @DeltaAssist

162938,173530,.@JetBlue your employee Wiz at MCO was unfathomably rude to me. He made our trip inconvenient and caused irreperable damage to my property.
162940,173532,@JetBlue Why is it more difficult to rebook a flight with TrueBlue points? Shouldn't it be easier for your loyal customers? Bad form.
162956,173548,Will drop my gold premier status with @united and switch to AA or Delta. #unitedfortahera #BoycottUnitedAirlines
162964,173556,Flight398 MCO to LGA late then diverted to JFK @JetBlue So why isn't customer service rep here telling us what's next?
