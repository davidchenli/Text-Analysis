Lesson from this trip. never flying @AmericanAir again!
Come on @united. we'd like to get off the plane now. I am missing the sunrise in Cancun sitting in the plane waiting for stairs! #thatsbad
Anyone else had stuff #stolen from their suitcase at #EWR when flying with #UnitedAirlines?? ;( ;( ;( @united @NY_NJairports
All these random delays. @americanair needs to get it's flight situation on point. Watch us miss our connecting flight in Dallas.
@JetBlue  yeahh umm you people better get your priorities straight cause the way you treated @MatthewLush  is completely unacceptable!
@DeltaAssist the fact my issue hasn't been addressed shows that DELTA has no interest in the 300 employees I'm my company using them!
So we have been sat on the Tarmac for an hour now ... No going anywhere ... I just want to go to sleep 😣😩😴 @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir flight 3324 got cancelled from YYZ; got put on @WestJet flight but my checked bags went missing. Reps say to talk to the other.
Just spoke with the RUDEST customer service rep after @VirginAmerica CANCELED my flight.  Thank you for your "great" customer service.
Hey. @AmericanAir staffing all (2) check in stations at #sea with trainees is a bad idea. Staff should know how to use the computers. Awful.
@AmericanAir flight 1049 was terrible today May 9th
@TodayInTheSky No. a relative waited 5 hours on tarmac w @SouthwestAir today! #SomethingsWrongPart2
Upset that @United is not crediting me flyer miles for my Thailand trip.I fly a lot.Wont be flying any company affiliated with them again
Response from @americanair. Working lavatories are not a safety issue on a flight. Therefore can remain indefinitely unfixed. #shameful
@mattfazzi @JetBlue I've never had a good experience with them.  Sorry man.
No more @JetBlue for me! Had the worst experience with them last night flying from RDU. Time to switch it up.
As seen on a @united itinerary. Seriously. what the hell is an "International Surcharge"? That one's new to me http://t.co/HfRgkg3had
@AmericanAir Yes. Both planes I flew on had maintenance issues yesterday.  And epic delays. NO concern for customer.
So many iphone6 apps suck @united @hootsuite I'm talkin bout you
. @SouthwestAir Hope you get this tweet from the sky. Your WiFi may have been the worst 8 dollars I have ever spent. Help me out!!!!!!
New @VirginAmerica site is all screwed up. The drop downs won't scroll. New interface hard to work with. Fix it guys. I'm giving up :-(
Never flying with @united again. The employees are incompetent and the airline has no respect for its customers.  @SouthwestAir here I come.
@DeltaAssist can you confirm my medallion upgrade? I've been on hold for an hour!
@united any idea why we are waiting for a gate at DFW international when there are quite literally 6 open united gates? Flying in from IAH
@united unfortunately Nope. Missed my connection entirely &amp; spending the night in Bush Intl for 5 sleepless hours. Waiting to get home now
@SouthwestAir I’ve been on hold all day trying to reschedule my flight that was cancelled. Can you please help here?
@subnetwork @AmericanAir I've never seen the mobile boarding pass cause anything but problems.
Remind me to never fly @united again.... Worst. Airline. Ever.
1.5 hrs into delay on @united 438 @fly2ohare ....can't we just #getanotherplane??
@united fuck you
@united The last 2 weeks I've flown wit u. you have given me 4 reasons to convince me it was a bad decision. Time 2 go back 2 @SouthwestAir
Hey. @USAirways. you've been delaying my 1:35 flight more and more since 8 am. You'd think you could fix that in 5+ hours. @AmericanAir
Hey @JetBlue first airline to boot me out of a seat I requested months ago... So unhappy with you guys.
Waiting patiently for @SouthwestAir to release their Thanksgiving flights so I can book one to see @keepcalmmKERIon #anythingbutpatient
@_hgordon @AmericanAir you really don't care about your customers whatsoever. We are all suffering from your unprofessionalism.
The story about @united doesn't surprise me at all. Any time I have had issues it has been on that airline's flight attendants.
This is not how I wanted to start my holidays. @united and @AmericanAir lost both of my bags. Why pay $60 if I wasn't going to get my bags?
@DeltaAssist can you help ? Trying to get to Rome from Milan. Flight 1017 cancelled. William abernathy
@SouthwestAir I know it happens - I was feeling so sorry for the Canton people and their delay. Just wish the agent had some details.
What's going on with @deltaassist ? Three days in a row I have been put on hold for over 40 minutes and still haven't talked to anyone.
@AmericanAir- my daughter had a horrible three days. 3 cancel flights.  2 delays. Trip from chi to Paris. Customer svc stinks
Long trip over a large part of the planet flying @united! Looking forward to it. but starting off with whats prob gonna be 1hr delay sux!
Still waiting. Is this a joke?!  @united All I want is to change flight times. #helpmeunited Almost an hour on hold. http://t.co/X4AmIWTFbk
@AmericanAir you are the worst airline in the world
@ItsNickBean @AmericanAir stop missing your friking flights 😂
@VirginAmerica I just wanna say the experience I had today at San Diego airport was horrible. The supervisor I believe whose
@SouthwestAir hours late for flight to leave due to mechanical problems. This is the last time we give you our business.
Anyone thinking of using @AmericanAir: Don't. REPEATEDLY one of the worst experiences I've ever had traveling and offer zero customer care.
@united wish someone would care that I just missed my second flight because the plane sat on the taxi for over an hour. Some vacation start.
@AmericanAir after dealing with your crap for a month you screwed me over on a second flight while I'm stuck in a foreign country. Terrible
Flying with @JetBlue were a disaster so far. They changed all our flights this morning. Both changed flights were delayed also!
I mean. I'm stuck in a middle seat. With a perfectly handsome man in first class sitting by himself. Come on @VirginAmerica
@AlaskaAir hey team. my bag got lost between you guys and TSA after I dropped it off at customs yesterday morning. Any help?
@united Where do you see this? When you sent this. a few hours later. and even now my flight shows as cancelled.
@AmericanAir conair - why did I have to pay for a ticket change yet I am now in the lounge waiting but my original flight is still boarding!
@JetBlue fuck you
How has @jetBlue been lately ?  Haven't flown with them in a while ?  I was MISERABLE on my so called @Delta "Upgrade" last flight.
@united 15 hour flight to China and no wifi or video. They just thanked me for my patience. I am not patient.
@internauta2009 no sabia que @AmericanAir iba a MAD en B757... @AlbertoPajaroto @fdeaguilaramat @MadridSpotter @El_Neyra @VolarEsPasion
C'mon @AmericanAir delay at JFK due to frozen pipes? You'd think preventative measures would be taken for winter; didn't suddenly get cold
@Sia wtf is this shit @united
@AmericanAir your lies about our delayed bag status ruined our holiday. instead of being w family we are waiting for your VERY late driver.
@JetBlue Exactly. that credit was from when you screwed up my flight the previous month. You have given me nothing for the second screwup
@united waiting for our Denver flight at the United club in jwa. http://t.co/e6SpQlUPJ1
What?!RT @RonaVGonzales: It's not "missing". it was "stolen"! RT @AmericanAir: @ronavgonzales Our apologies your baggage is missing. Rona...
@DeltaAssist I was cutting it close to DL4691 after TSA delay but arrived 11 mins pre departure; GA had already closed doors &amp; left. :( :(
@JetBlue I hope that flight 1533  on 2-21 from CTG to JFK has running water.  Because flight 1532 JFK-CTG ran out of running water Not cool
Airlines are playing dirty with seat assignments of late.  Chose my seats with @AmericanAir on flt tomorrow now unavail &amp; have to pay extra
@DeltaAssist flight DL662 disappointed with care and service in first class. where can I get complaint addressed.
thanks @JetBlue for the ability to jam out to @JSchwartzNYC on my flight to Vegas... he's killing it right now... http://t.co/4sw6ofMssR
@AmericanAir you're scaring me with this talk of 226 seats in the 787. BA has 214 and it's torture in Economy.http://t.co/wIUsBTFpkw
@DeltaAssist Where is my lost item? I never heard back from the lost+found team. It's been 3 weeks now. I want my item back :(
Why can't @SouthwestAir send out more timely delay info? They had to know 335 was late way before 1250 as the plane was coming from ft laude
Flight AA3331 delays after delays... @AmericanAir is this the new AA??? Remind me to fly United next time. UGH!!
@united When is a cancelled flight not cancelled?
@DeltaAssist #fail #epic #fail Your customer care is closed today even though I was requested to contact them today. #noreply on tweets :(
@united Friend called for change of flight. United wanted change fee of $1.250 per ticket. A joke and rip off. And there was room on flight
Delayed flight... Smh @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Do you have an ETA on the logging in issues
@chrisdelia on a scale of 1 to ricky martin. how mad are you at @united ?
When @United spits on 1K members. it's time to leave &amp; head to @Delta  Read my #travel story: http://t.co/1cI5BQyKMe http://t.co/AGaq9m5v47
When you're stuck in a middle seat and check the @Delta app every 10 minutes if something's opened up @DeltaAssist HELP!
@morgypotpie @SouthwestAir @mayabatshir It's okay. @SpiritAirlines screwed me with a 13hr layover In Ft. Lauderdale (aka Ft. Fucktville)
@AmericanAir Can you help me get home to my daughter? My flight tomorrow from Chi to DC is cancelled (322). I am flex on airports.
Possibly gonna miss our flight cause of super slow bag check in at Boston. Thanks @JetBlue.
To the bitch at @SouthwestAir who thought i was hiding something in my hair FUCK YOU THATS WHY YOURS WONT GROW BITCH .
@united first delayed. then cancelled. You SUCK.
@JetBlue My flight was just cancelled and I can't get anyone on the phone. How do I book a new flight?
@AlaskaAir I'm sad you don't have an #ipad #app b/c I got one for xmas. But happy that #iflyalaska for my first flight of 2015 tomorrow.
@AmericanAir what the hell does "baggage not located yet" mean??? How can it not be known where it went
@united Need to file complaint about this overall experience. Could you please provide a point of contact?
Sad @AmericanAir @USAirways w/NOT respond to my complaint letter re: the offensive behavior toward me on flt 755 from France #custservice ?
@SouthwestAir delay my flight... I dare you.
@AmericanAir why is your wait times so grossly underestimated? I gave up after waiting on the for over an hour despite AA saying 5-8 minutes
@Americanair please open up a gate and get flight 78 off the DFW Tarmac and off this plane!
no response? @DeltaAssist how is it possible you have not found ipad left on flight when you have the flight #. seat #. exact location. etc?
Delayed again. Does @SouthwestAir ever leave on time? #miserableflying
.@SouthwestAir the customer service at Oakland is horrific. never cared. #soutwest #customerservice given run around all day....
@DeltaAssist Where can I mail a written complaint?  Delayed bags on back to back flights to me is an unacceptable service standard !!!!
@SouthwestAir I don't understand early arrivals when we just sit on the tarmac waiting for a gate WN2275
@Convertbond @united you act like United cares about it's customers. They never have and never will.
@united My Aunt was asked to share room w stranger in Houston after flight delay. Unacceptable. Best way to contact live person?
@VirginAmerica what's up with the counter staff at LGA this morning??  Rudest hospitality staff ever...definitely going back to AA.
Man. and I thought @united flight attendants were horrible before they were all infected with ebola. @thehill
@united connection flight in houston several hours no customer service. no compassion
@rwang0 @SouthwestAir It always makes me sad because it's usually people who can't afford to get kicked off.
@Zak_Bagans @SouthwestAir I hear ya I do not like Air Transat seats are horrible
Both flights delayed tonight. Now no crew to push the plane back. @AmericanAir . my row volunteers to get out and give us a shove off.
@united been waiting for a gate at dca for over an hour with 2 children. Unacceptable.
â€œ@alexishenson:Hey @SouthwestAir. you've made my mom mad &amp; now she's says she plans on calling you to let you know. You've been forewarnedâ€ðŸ˜‚
It's too late. Since @SouthwestAir couldn't get me home in a timely manner I had to switch airlines. Frustrating and unfortunate experience.
@united #UA5105 complete terrible flight to #cmh First told delay was ATC. then no pilot. then no crew. then mechanical. 6 hour delay unfair
@SouthwestAir I am a huge fan &amp;loyal customer. but my last two flights hv been delayed for several hrs. SFO-&gt;AUS. Flight 2day delayed 4 hrs!
On the 2nd day of Christmas @AmericanAir gave to me a cancelled flight and a change fee
Its a pitty that @AmericanAir gives Venezuela's customers so bad service. For years we were loyal customers #platinumaadvantage :(
@_rakeshjain @TarekFatah @united   It's worse airline. I traveled once from Melbourne Australia to LA. That was worse experience I ever had
@VirginAmerica worst inflight service ever! Not UA low. but an order of magnitude worse than the usual delight I've come to expect. #VX027
@AmericanAir I've been delayed WHILE sitting on a plane for 2 1/2 hrs to be cancelled and now they won't give me my luggage. I want to leave
_@good: Passengers shout "leave her alone!" as United Airlines removes girl with autism from flight @united  a bowl of hot food too much?
@AmericanAir flight 1521 - unacceptable that we were delayed 2.5 hours for airplane maintenance and over an hour wait for luggage at LAS!!
@DeltaAssist Your website just robbed me and said my card was declined. now im missing $600
@united Worst service EVER. Used 1K global upgrades yesterday. Ok'd by mgr on phone. today taken away by other mgr. Shame on u United UNFair
@AmericanAir flight attendants you're RUDE! -s
@AdamSinger i've never flown with them! maybe i will the next time i head to SFO... @VirginAmerica
Why are we delayed on this very full @united flight?  The catering company failed to deliver galley carts?  Seriously??  #lifeontheroad
@united ASHAMED
@DeltaAssist I don't understand why the bug hasn't been fixed yet with the calendar? This is pathetic. PATHETIC. FIX THE DAMN CALENDAR.
.@AmericanAir youre a despicable. disgusting airline. Your crap doesn't get past me. You are bullies. And liars. I hope you go bankrupt.
@united are you going to an issue an apology to the racism and discrimination a passenger had received by one of your attendants ?
@DDonatelo30 @CNET @united I'm not an aircraft expert but any external intervention should be a security issue. regardless of the system
@JetBlue straight up Ive never flown another airline in my life other than yours but I'm flying someone else this week #newbaggagepolicysux
@JetBlue hey. flew with u last night BOS - MCO @ 8.20pm.Great flight but u lost my son's case.Spoke 2 desk @ MCO but not much luck.Help! :-)
.@United leaves crated dog in pouring rain on tarmac. #irresponsible http://t.co/BTVhIaOq5C
Silver lining of my cancelled flight tmrw: I just racked up a ton of points by booking last minute thru @SouthwestAir #moderntravelprobs
@United @Orbitz Shame on both of you! #bigcorpbully
@DeltaAssist Seriously?  Morning flight delayed due to mechanical. evening flight canceled.  No comp. nothing for a PM?  What the? #CXfail!
@JetBlue I have to travel intl to India with several connecting flights. And you guys cancelled my flight to JFK
@AmericanAir completely screwed me and I may miss a trip to Switzerland. @united did everything they could but @AirCanada refusing to help.
@SouthwestAir I didn't purchase. Was just the Alist login page not working. Just didn't use wifi today. Wanted to bring it to attention.
@united where do I go to provide feedback for a recent poor customer service experience?
Recent  @DeltaAssist experience has been less than    Stellar.  4 flights = 9 hours delay.  I live out west.  Weather not the problem
@united an entire day wasted by dropping us at the wrong airport b/c pilot reached max flying hours by getting to the dep. 2 hours late
aye fam. your plane needs to leave already @AmericanAir
Why is it taking @SouthwestAir so long to depart? More than a 45 minute wait on the plane. I feel like I'm on @USAirways.
@AmericanAir  I was wondering why my bag wasn't on my flight an it was promised to be on my next one at 11 an they never showed
@united a "passport problem with a crew member" returns a loaded a fully fueled 777 to the gate?   How about the truth?  #fail UA989
@AmericanAir You lost my Dad's luggage in a flight from DFW to MCO 10 days ago and not a word from you about it.He has to bought new clothes
@MelRuetsche @SouthwestAir - hey @SouthwestAir follow me so I can direct message you my confirmation # for the delayed LAX bags.
@SouthwestAir My flight just got cancelled help me out! What do I do ðŸ‘€
@AlaskaAir flight #626 to Las Vegas. attendant screams at caterer that door cannot be opened when slide is engaged. Waiting for maint. #fml
@AmericanAir   The bad attitudes of the gate staff and flight crew is getting old!
@United I need a corporate level contact to discuss issues that have occurred over the last 24 hours and not Customer Care.
@lybr3 Shame on âž¡ï¸ @Orbitz &amp; @united for bullying! When they're not #RAPING consumers all of a sudden they don't like their own medicine! ðŸ˜·
@JensenAckles @AmericanAir hashtag frustrated
I hate @United new mileage plus program. Total rip off in terms of earring miles and costs $$ to actually redeem them!
@DeltaAssist had a very disappointing flight on Monday 5/11 flight 472 JFK - San Fran. NO WIFI!!! Need to do work on a Monday morning.
@SouthwestAir Just got a @TripIt alert abt 3 hr delay on 2515. no word from SW. On hold for almost 30 min. Need info!
@camerondallas @AmericanAir Poor cam :( ease help him @AmericanAir
Homeward bound! Only 11 hrs 2 go. Only complaint is @united slippers not made for size 13.  #safetravels #NRT-DEN http://t.co/vKur7wgnZf
@HandicapThis In my experience. flying @united = lost luggage and bad customer service
@DeltaAssist how long does it usually take for you all to respond to concerns our complaints...?
@AmericanAir u never cease to disappoint.  Another epic failure!  #epicfailure
@United you suck. Your stewardess called me a bitch under her breath today. Classy. @JetBlue all the way from now on. you SUCK @united!
Another flight on @SouthwestAir means another ridiculous delay. Hopefully i make it home before I have to be at work in the am
@JetBlue Ticket agent switched my family member's seat. Customer svc didnt have record of the switched seat when I inquired. Very fishy.
@JustinNFJK @AmericanAir if I worked there I'd probably kick my own ass
@AmericanAir get your shit together
@AmericanAir @iamryanodonnell Ryan. we no longer support Windows Phone. Bad choice. @AmericanAir
Thieves target @AmericanAir and @united airlines and break into customer's accounts. Listen @KRLD @CBSDFW
@united Flt 1577 delayed 4 hours w mech issues. Got H2O after 3 hours. No food. #SilverStarAlliance #Disappointed
After queuing up for takeoff here at ORD. @united is sending back to the gate for a "Maintenances Issue." Sigh... #mcaTravelsMaintained
@AmericanAir I will NEVER fly with you again I would rather walk to Georgia I could probably get there faster anyways
Disgusting discrimination and profiling. Not flying @united until they apologize to her.  #unitedfortahera http://t.co/eh0aqz8lXE
@SouthwestAir I would be. but delayed!
2 canceled flights. 2 hour wait but @VirginAmerica got me home.
@SouthwestAir I know delays are part of flying but it seems you have delays on every evening flight nowadays. Becoming unacceptable!
I will never fly @united  again
@united won't let me leave #FAR without figuring how to take care of my guitar first. this is how you do customer service. #thankyou

@united #5582 delayed at ATL gate with no explanation from pilots. Lots of activity in cockpit. scurrying about.
Couldn't make one leg of @SouthwestAir flight. so they cancel the entire flight &amp; no refund?  A list for 3 years...never flying them again
@SouthwestAir I know there's bad weather. but I've been on hold for 30mins. Tried switching my flight. said change pending. now no record.
@Snugzmeow @DeltaAssist I wish social media existed then. I would have raised hell lol. Miss our flight because the gate attendant left

@united y'all canceled my flight last night @ 9 pm. put me on a flight to leave at 10 am. lost an entire vacation day and still haven't left
@RyanAdams41 @united lost mine and blythe's luggage too. My family had 3 people fly to Harrisburg and they lost all of our bags.
@united So if I have a problem with the refund I can't communicate w anyone?
I flew @united and watched them harass a Muslim woman who didn't speak English almost to tears about holding her baby on the flight
Very bad experience @americanair. Tried to curb check bag 1 hour before flight time. I ended up booked on a flight 3 hours later. $100 more.
Hey @united I just submitted feedback for you at http://t.co/inMybYJ7dl Please address my issue. http://t.co/jHclvWhBoy  #badService
@united you have ruined your last trip for me. Multiple delays and now just sitting. I will miss my next flight. My vacation is ruined.
@united screws up again! Changed seats so fam can't sit together. In Feb. they changed connection city and BROKE OUR SAND CEREMONY VASE!
@SouthwestAir Goodbye!  Your reduced flight schedule is no longer convenient for me from LIT to DAL.  I drive instead. Get home quicker.
@united So let's get this straight United has switched my seat from "Economy plus window" to a MIDDLE for the 3rd flight in a row - GARBAGE
@united File ref CMH35001M my luggage still not here. 40 minute wait on tf-number unacceptable. Can't do anything without bag. Where is it?
@AmericanAir I wait for the TWA - any date yet?

NEVER fly @AmericanAir under any circumstances...even life or death. #TheySuck

@Justin_Neuman @VirginAmerica The smell McD's french fries ARE pretty unmistakable.
Just got off the phone with the rudest @AmericanAir "supervisor" ever. Her attitude and unwillingness to help were beyond shocking.
Just booked to head to #NMX! Got killer rates on @SouthwestAir - and can't wait to stay at @MGMGrand hotel again! #vegas #media

Flight 1742 la to newark. missing necklace charm gold please help find @united
@AmericanAir I figured they could've taken care of the maintenance during the 2 hour delay while waiting for a crew...worst airline ever.

@AmericanAir wtf aa? Been 8 hrs on hold and can't  get a single customer service rep on the line
@united your signage for united express flight arriving in term 2 at ORD needs some attention. Poor service to let people know where it's at
@SouthwestAir my wife's flight has been cancelled and she's been on hold for an hour and a half to try and figure out a change/refund. #help
I really would appreciate some help from @JetBlue since my flight keeps getting delayed an hour at a time this afternoon
Delayed yet again @dfwairport @AmericanAir. It's sad when you expect it to happen . Whole trip a complete mess. #NeverAgain #aasucks
@DeltaAssist Doubt it over 144 characters on Twitter. Plus. it's taken you 2 days to respond already. You guys are just a horrible company.
@Rich_Crawford6 @VirginAmerica you wanna be Iggy azalea so bad ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚
Extremely disappointed &amp; angry w @united airlines customer service. You are NOT going to get away with talking down to customers like that.
@AmericanAir I've been trying to go home since Sunday. but you guys keep having maintained issues. Who do I speak to so I can get a refund
missed my flight. but thoroughly enjoying the eye candy at SFO. thanks @VirginAmerica!
@AmericanAir. you disconnected me after being on hold 20 minutes. After another 20 minutes. I found that you screwed up my reservation.
@Delta is literally the WORST tell me why they cancelled my flight the day of for no reason and a 2 hour wait over the phone?? @DeltaAssist
This is a new excuse for a delayed flight on @AmericanAir . pilot fatigue. Late departure as usual and still looking for a new pilot.
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for over five and a half hours... Can I please get help rescheduling my 6:58am flight?
waiting for boarding. (at @United Club in Chek Lap Kok) https://t.co/jiDMkghG1N http://t.co/ynIic9XiXV
@united "hard" is far from how the staff has worked the last few days in Texas. I've never had such a poor customer service experience
@AlaskaAir I keep flying w/u in hopes that you will treat ur customers better &amp; I'm starting 2 realize it's never going 2 happen #sadbuttrue
@AmericanAir The Silence is so overwhelmingly loud! I'm nearly at the point of questioning whether I properly submitted my complaint form.
I wish someone would response at your offices and on your main number abt how yall lost my luggage @SouthwestAir
.@united r u currently experiencing system wide IT issues impacting all flights? Can you let customers know the impact
8 hour delay. no apology. Vegas plans for eve ruined. 12 dollar voucher.  Really. @AmericanAir ?!?
@SouthwestAir just called me 12 hours before my flight to tell me it was cancelled. and my agent had the personality of a cardboard box. 👎
@jetblue been on hold 25 mins and counting to book a getaway! :( Why is it such a long wait on a Wednesday night?
@AlaskaAir I did &amp; it hung up on me the first 2 times. Just extremely frustrated bc the seats &amp; pricing are no longer available. What now?
This is how @united treats safety concerns? Never flying with them again. and neither should you. http://t.co/HT8btV8GzF via @usatoday
How is it that @united baggage claim at IAD is routinely one of the worst in the country?
Long commute this AM made longer by my @united delay
UGH. looks like @JetBlue is no longer my airway of choice thanks to added baggage fees and less leg room. Just another one in the mix now.
@southwestair Where are all your employees in St Louis??? You have huge lines and no one here to help us. I better not miss my flight.
That seems really odd @AmericanAir. We are sitting on the Tarmac in queue for takeoff...
You know who loves sitting on the tarmac and not moving. @AmericanAir? Little kids.
@AmericanAir Disappointed - 48+ hours since I booked awards ticket. not issued.1 call to address. call 2 on hold. no ticket for tomorrow yet
@AmericanAir I've never been so disappointed in service &amp; after today I'll be reconsidering my airline loyalty &amp; who I fly wkly
@AmericanAir YOU TOTALLY SCREWED UP OUR FLIGHT! NEVER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINE THEY ARE HORRIBLE
This is what a first class cabin with @AmericanAir looks like. Service sucks and food is gross.  All I got is a sorry http://t.co/o5elpsQNkZ
@mrdenny @united They sent it using the onboard wifi. its a bit slow.
Finally too 2months later after @AmericanAir and @iflymia told me it wasn't their problem for stealing 20k worth http://t.co/FNi6IzujLw
Hey! @flyLAXairport and @southwestair there's two birds trapped and hungry and scared in this terminal! HELP THEM GET OUT PLZ
glad i'm not the only one that now makes an effort to avoid flying @AmericanAir horrendous new product. http://t.co/KFrtp1n8Bp
@SouthwestAir appalled at rude/horrible service from RICO just now in your customer service center.I just lost my dog &amp;a close friend. #SOS
@DeltaAssist Have been on hold for the RTW Award desk for over two hours.  Any idea on if I can get a call back instead?
@AmericanAir AA4322 JAX-ORD now delayed 1 1/2 hours behind original time!? Comp?
@AmericanAir flt 2212 (DFW - STL) has made me nvr want 2 fly AA again! Stuck on plane 2hrs to be moved to new 1. etc. extremely frustrating!
Oh dear @VirginAmerica. Just boarded your VX183 flight to SFO. Smells like an overripe gym. Air freshener possibly? Would really help.
@JetBlue why did you get rid of the refund to your travel bank when the fare dropped below your purchase price? #notcool
@AmericanAir - please consider upgrading to system that calls your customers back. 2.5 hours on hold hurts the neck. http://t.co/wEcMxtnarj
If #cellphone causes trouble w/ #airlines why was the guy trapped in the @AlaskaAir plane able to call for help without troubling the plane.
75% of all @united flights I've booked have either been significantly delayed or canceled. Guess we're spending more time in Vegas. =(
Missin nephews bday party @AmericanAir pilot decided 2 take hour lunch #notcool #americanairlines #flight3044 #imissSWA
Never going to book a flight with @united until a formal apology is given to @TaheraHAhmad ! We stand with you #UnitedForTahera
@AmericanAir i'm stuck on 4255. please get us out of here. i'm starving!!!
One hour of delay so far ..... #help @SouthwestAir http://t.co/P8PaVP7vhu
Ahh @united little help. First cancelled flight now no one knows where our bags are. #stuck #frustrating
@madisonrenee7 @AmericanAir I had the same issue
5 worst airlines in America and I'm not at all surprised that @united is in that list! #Aviation #Airlines  http://t.co/ZdUUEipGVd
Let's hope my @AmericanAir flight goes better than it did tonight my flight got delayed one time to many
@AmericanAir cancelled flight at LAX to SAN no communication. rude staff. finally on shuttle bus. Staff should communicate. Compensation?
@iamwill @united mother fuckers did it to some of us going to Vegas for a friends wedding. I'm sure u can pull a few strings no?
It's been problem after problem after problem with @USAirways and @AmericanAir I'll be damned if I fly with them again smh
@AmericanAir my flight has been cancelled. Who can I call to get home. This is ridiculous. This is the 3rd time this has happened this month
Not confident flying on @united again. 2+ hr "maintenance" delay from ORD to LHR.Makes me wonder if I should place my faith in @AmericanAir
Flights been delayed 2 hours. It's very nice watching the Mexican lady's giggle behind the counter while the rest of us sit here @AlaskaAir
Truly despise trying to work with @AmericanAir  Someone stop me if I ever suggest flying on an AA flight again. #frustrating
@DeltaAssist JFK--&gt;BOS @ 5:00pm cancelled. No text/email. 4+ hr hold for call. Am I rebooked? Refunded? Need to figure out travel options!
@united has a horrible service.Flight attendant "we do not give connection gates to passengers. You need to download the app in your phone"
I hope like hell @united responds to my online complaint!  You'd be remiss to let a talk show host walk away angry!
Aa screwed us w/out concern. Worse seat than paid for &amp; 40 hour layover.  U cost me &amp; @elmasrudy lots o time &amp; $! @AmericanAir @AmeriAirSux
.@United this is the worst safety video ever! Telling me how to buckle my seat belt whilst travelling in a taxi. C'mon.
So the wifi on this @United flight doesn't allow me to go on the @FreeOnes website. What the fuck is that?
@SouthwestAir I've been waiting on hold for 2 hours to reschedule a cancelled flight. Can you help?
@AmericanAir you've failed again.only today your AGENT cancelled  instead of backup booking &amp; gave away my 1st class seat. #sellyourstock
That's me pissed learning no WIFI on the flight to LA 4 bhetv biz....WTF @SouthwestAir got some tweets N Shit 2 send! http://t.co/eCBjye1JPH
Another day and still no news or update from @USAirways @AmericanAir #lostluggage #badservice
After maintenance was done. were waiting for a route and now the @united pilot timed out and we're waiting for a new one.
There goes what little hope I had left: @United Airlines just put its top LAWYER in charge of customer service http://t.co/PHhlBq6QJz #fail
@JetBlue if you're deciding whether to cancel a flight. don't make us wait over 2.5 hours to give us a verdict
Every @AmericanAir employee is either flat evil. an utter moron or both. Your shit company exists solely by government fiat.
The new @united site looks like a Windows Metro ripoff. https://t.co/OauqleQpeR
Sat on runway 2hr+1hr delay on@Delta.Wish my old colleague who whined for dayz about a 40min delay on @americanair endured it instead.#karma
@AmericanAir is the worst!!  They broke my bag &amp; won't help me. I will do my best to never fly with them again #lame
@AmericanAir DFW-OGG update these crappy planes! Spent $2K in upgrade fees for a seat falling apart &amp; mean flight attendants!
The internet was so unusable on my @SouthwestAir flight to St Louis that i couldn't complain on Twitter. $8 wasted.
.@SouthwestAir it's time to invest in a seat reservation system. The herding of cattle is ridiculous.
@AmericanAir cancelled my flight &amp;lost a day in cali because of it. put me on a new flight which is 100$ cheaper and they won't refund me
@DeltaAssist trying to see about an upgrade for intl flight tomm.  DCA/Lima.  Been waiting 30 mins to talk to rep.  Can u help?
@AmericanAir pilot on 1243... Reason we have been sitting here waiting for about an hour is all gates have  airplanes needing maintenance.
@SouthwestAir 50 minutes on hold is a bit too much don't ya think?
â€œ@USAirways: @jimzito please see a baggage agent for an update.â€ in Philly from SAT. Why are your baggage so slow? Learn from @AlaskaAir
@DeltaAssist you responded and didn't even bother to read the post. Typical.
Ouch. Gonna suck to fly WN tomorrow. And next week. MT @jonostrower: The 128 737-700s account for about 20% of @SouthwestAir's total fleet.
Worst experience with @AmericanAir never again !
Long line to #rebook #flight @AmericanAir #worst #customerservice stuck in #Miami @AmeriAirSux http://t.co/95SLGTbV7F
I Valerie Cherish'd my disgusting and rude @AmericanAir flight attendant. "Sir. that seatbelt sign is not a mirage. it's on." "Is it?"
@SouthwestAir delay is keeping my Christmas wish in Sacramento instead of Texas tonight. Another lonely night. Miss you. Come home please
@JetBlue Hello. Do you do customer service here? We had two cabs let us down. running late. can't check in via app or site. no call answer.
@gsrnn @KLM @Delta @DeltaAssist What did they do? Let the shame loose.
so @jetblue delays my flight to JFK which will make me miss @Fly_Norwegian to Sweden &amp; won't refund me any of my $$ #boycottjetblue #help
No better feeling than when the flight attendant gives you the WHOLE CAN instead of that bullshit cup. You stay classy @AmericanAir
@DeltaAssist Why is it over a 2 hr wait to speak with an actual person over the phone? A one way flight is costing me more than round trip
DELAYED + missing connection = SUCKS! After 1hr on hold w/ @united. my issue is resolved. Be at #PBRBIL w/time for a nap.
@SouthwestAir Worst flight ever.  Actually heard a FA ask if a CSA can look up a passenger to confirm he is a celebrity. Awful abuse of pwr
@AmericanAir is the worst! My flight to Chicago was cancelled due to a fire at Ohare. now I have to pay an extra $300 to rebook my flight
Hello @SouthwestAir. you have a bad habit of cancelling flight 596 on Sun nights.  Please do not cancel it tonight.
@Fit_CrazyCatMan @AmericanAir Oh noooooo! The worse ever!! ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜¨
@united I'm being offered a different flight. but do I want to wait another 5 hours on top of the 2 of delays that caused this? #waitformeee
@AmericanAir The worst experience of my life.on 01/06/15 I traveled with AA.all was OK until I arrived to baggage area and NO baggage.
81 bags left in Chicago by @united. not getting here until tonight. Worst recent travel experience. So much for #friendlyskies
@AmericanAir worst customer service experience
@DeltaAssist no one greeting the flight and a shift change? and u knew it never made my flight?
@AmericanAir The day of flights (25+ of them!) I want to visit my sis (on miles) are blacked out. #rude @SouthwestAir does it better.
@AmericanAir I have some problems with my reservation and I leave on Friday. Is there someone I can contact?
I know that to you @delta it's just another bag. but for me. it has all my clothes in it. and it's ruining my holiday @deltaassist #findbag
@JetBlue we did but that's not helping us get our bag now is it? never again will we fly JetBlue ever! it was our first and last time
@CokoNee @LMichelle10 @SouthwestAir has lost my luggage. Terribly disappointed.  What a aggravating way to start my birthday!
@AmericanAir  What terrible customer service. Sure there can be weather problems but why is no one at the gate when people get off to help?
@JetBlue Kudos; my 1st flight w/ u; love the extra legroom. wider seats. Fly-Fi &amp; friendly flight attendants. Switching from @AlaskaAir
is there anything worse than sitting on a delayed @united plane. watching the odds making your connection shrink by the minute?
Wifi &amp; TV is not working on flight 4018. Glad I charged my devices yesterday when I got this email. @SouthwestAir http://t.co/CDPBGN7ZIL
@JetBlue no compensation with TrueBlue Points or travel bank credit?!
.@SouthwestAir Your Wifi is terrible. http://t.co/eCq4GgPIq7
@JetBlue as someone whose brother was killed by a terrorist on 9-11. it's insulting that you would think @MatthewLush is a physical threat.
@AmericanAir better late than never.
@AmericanAir we have been sitting on the plane for two hours at the gate waiting for a pilot. And the power ports aren't working
@JetBlue website kept crashing. Very disappointed.
@SouthwestAir you cancelled my flight to EWR. Flt 3076. U also cancelled flights to LGA. Yet @united is flying on time to both. WTH??
@AmericanAir AA 46. I understand but it can get frustrating at times!
@united I am on the phone trying to get a flight changed and the employee is so rude. There is a discrepancy btw price hes saying vs online
@AmericanAir Now your website and mobile is broken. Can't login to check-in for my flight in a few hours. System maint going on for days now
@DeltaAssist Have been on hold for 20 minutes. Trying to get my Delta app account unlocked. Flying in the morning. Help please?
@DeltaAssist Hello. can I please file a complaint from my flight that I am currently on? Can I DM you the details?
Just realizing that not only did baggage handlers at @VirginAmerica ruined my MacBook Pro. my iPad is now ruined too. I mean seriously.
@Alancumming @VirginAmerica Please continue making Mr. Cumming suffer. I enjoy seeing him all riled up. Love. xo
@JetBlue just frustrating to pay for extra space and I'm getting it.
patience is worn thru. @JetBlue this is ridiculous. after a 3 hour flight delay. we've now been waiting on the plane for an hour.
@AmericanAir 1113 from PIT to DFW cancelled b/c your plane blew black smoke and maintenance needs to order parts? Can't call this weather
My @JetBlue flight out of Denver got delayed until 1:50 plus no one at the check-in counter. Starting to feel like @tomhanks in The Terminal
@AmericanAir The service at ORD gate K18 for  8:30 am flight 1192 to LAX was horrid. No need to take it out on passengers.
@AmericanAir Spent 2.5 hours on hold last night. Will I ever get my luggage back? Gone since Friday.
@enthused @united Sad to hear #custserv
@AmericanAir your baggage system at LAX annex for gate 44 is crazy bad. Slow. long lines and no lighting. Signed an Exec Plat #fail
@AmericanAir I can't believe how many times your people had lied to me! Never again I will flight in these company
Wow @JetBlue my aunt dies and I fly to TX to officiate her memorial and you won't refund a previously scheduled flight? Pretty pathetic.
@breakingtravel @WSJ @JetBlue that's a shame. companies that can't stick to their foundations.
@AmericanAir after personally spending on necessary accommodations&amp;26 hours late I’m back.rebooking wasn’t problem. The 1st mentioned was!
@JetBlue your app stinks as the last few weeks. Flight status says no flights found. constantly. Good thing @flightaware is working.
Worse service ever on @DeltaAssist DL 16. Makes want to not fly Delta again
@VirginAmerica this is the worst flight experience ever! I've been delayed 6 hours and gone to 10 gates! I'm gonna miss my first day of work
I hate @AmericanAir 😡😡😡😡 http://t.co/TuRxPKtPVz
@camerondallas @AmericanAir meanwhile cam tweeting his person flight  issues _ hope you get a flight soon xx_
@VirginAmerica smells like U are piping vaporized alcohol through the air vents. New #CDC disinfectant rules? :-) #DoctorOfficeSmell #NotBad
Hey @united - still sitting on the tarmac for ~120 minutes with no end in sight no drink/food. #ua3396
@AmericanAir  it's 547am &amp; im @ the airport waiting for a departure at 1040. Y? B/c u didnt  inform me that the flight had been cancelled .
@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago. without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed.
Worst part of being forced to switch flights: was Group A is now Group C. cmon @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir 81 year old had surgery missed flight rebook wants $175. Customer sat line is busy #wonderwhy
@JetBlue you have the worst customer service in the airline industry. and should really be ashamed of yourself as a brand #jetblue #travel
@AmericanAir crew notified us when we left at 7am that the internet was not working. Mid flight we were notified about the power.
@TheBiancaDelRio @VirginAmerica @Virgin 23 hours in coach.the very fucking idea I don't like delta n partners because of that #neverflydelta
@AmericanAir   How much longer is my delay???  I wanna see my baby!!!
Flight got delayed as the aircraft has to be replaced. At least they figured it out BEFORE the take-off @United
@united no expedited boarding for families travelling with infants? Clearly not a family-friendly airline! #badairline #unitedairlines
Had the WORST airport experience of my entire life with an @AmericanAir worker today
@SouthwestAir very upset. Yesterday. flight delayed from 9:55pm to 11:45pm &amp; now a 6:30pm delayed to 7:55. Consideration for passengers?
@united  There seems to be an issue with your new M+ app. Can't log in or see any items. http://t.co/2CPnsc0kmM
@SouthwestAir has some of the worst employees.Learn to show some concern for their flyers &amp; not be sittin in the office on your phones #rude
hey @jetblue can you help me with a reservation? been on hold for half hour already...
@AmericanAir screws a broke college kid ( @Justinfouts ) out of $90 for a hotel room due to a malfunctioning plane #seriously #ridiculous
@DeltaAssist I had a cancelled flight because of no pilot. No hotel and no food with an 8.5 hours sleeping on airport floor!
Hey @AmericanAir  maybe you should put more than 3 agents at the counter when you cancel my flight. Nothing like telling me 20 minutes prior
@AmericanAir 6 hour delayed flight AA94 to Madrid with no tvs? @united wouldn't play me like that :( @mktooley @runway4 #baitandswitch
@VirginAmerica Due to your flight from Vegas leaving over an hour late I missed my next flight. Now have to wait 6 hours for the next one!
@thomasaugusto @AmericanAir That's ridiculous. I've heard so many complaints from that airline lately. They need to get their shit together.
Well thankful that this 7 hour screaming baby flight with the nonexistent FlyFi @JetBlue boasts about is over.
big shout-out to @VirginAmerica for helping me get my lost ipad back!
Hey @SouthwestAir if I can't get the bag that was sent to St. Louis yesterday (I was not sent to St. Louis) I will be so sad
First and last flight with @AmericanAir. Worst customer service. 😒 #TeamSouthwest
I get to the airport at 6:45 for a flight that was delayed til 7:50. or so I thought. #Southwest #wtf @southwestair http://t.co/IlZsjBX0Pe
@AmericanAir I have been on hold for 45 minutes trying to book a new flight after mine were canceled. Any idea on phone wait times?
@AmericanAir how many emails and information do you guys need? Do you not have a database? #horribleservice
Has @JetBlue ever had a flight that wasn't delayed? Hint: that was a rhetorical question.
Tried to switch my @United flight to 4 different times today from Houston to Newark. None had wi-fi. It’s 2015. How is that possible?
@AmericanAir trying to reschedule a cancelled stopover but there's no one at support. Who do I talk to?
Can someone at @VirginAmerica please contact me about a damaged baggage claim? #Thanks
@AmericanAir will do. I can't wait for a single reservations system. code share tickets are crap. and US or AA can't help. Just blank stare.
@AmericanAir my flight shouldn't be delayed because you can't figure out how to fill out a maintenance report with @USAirways
@JetBlue snack boxes. Not meals. The flight is longer than ones that offer real food.
@AllegiantTravel never had this happen on @Delta @united @AmericanAir plus having to pay $75 in luggage fees
@JetBlue thanks just called and rep got the same we're experiencing technical problem message when she searched for flight using points
@DeltaAssist will call when I land - we have to figure something out. Unacceptable
@dataeditor @floodfish that's what i was thinking.  in this case. though. i was complaining about how slow @united's homepage is.
7 weeks now @AmericanAir since u took advantage of customers during a medical emergency&amp; refuse to respond to their request. #Pathetic
@DCHomos @united   I'm horribly disappointed.  Are there any airlines anymore that haven't discriminated against somebody????
@Delta @DeltaAssist just flew from #Dubai to #Atlanta and the entertainment system was broken. Yeah. it's 16 hr flight. nbd. #NeverAgain
@AmericanAir  I've now spent about 5 hours on the tarmac between two days and two flights. Ridiculous. Some weather but some ineptitude too.
@united 1st Class bump LGA. Promised Club pass as part of fix. Get to club. club says nothing in record. Denied entry. Broken promises. Poor
Where's the @voxdotcom or @FiveThirtyEight article on how to improve baggage claim?Cuz this sucks #30minsandcounting @united @Dulles_Airport
@DeltaAssist My first flight is 45 minutes delayed. I may be missing my connecting flight - have been on hold for 29 minutes now
@Delta @DeltaAssist any news on the new crew for DL4020? waiting for them for 2 hours now on the plane. Please help me get home to my girls!
@mpesce you can fly @united from SFO. I wouldnâ€™t (I go via NZ). but it is  an option. A horrible horrible option.
@DeltaAssist Boston to Atlanta 5:15. 10 upgrades and can't check the seats.   Sad service.
Departing almost 2 hours late. Glad I booked @AlaskaAir. #sarcasm #FlightDelays
@DeltaAssist why is 4610 delayed 4 hours due to weather and 4560. scheduled to depart *later* is on time?
(1/2) I have family in India who are adopting a child. The embassy issued an early Visa for them to leave ASAP because... // @united
#UnitedAirlines yall suck. It's 2015. grow up and issue an apology. @united
@AmericanAir At destination. missing 2 bags. It was scanned to be on flight but it didn't make it on the plane. 1st cancelation. now this!
@united no. I noticed it when home. Then phoned and got a mail address. But no response there at all.
@united you are hands down the worst airline!!!
@AmericanAir sitting on the runway at DFW waiting to park. I have a connection in 15 to AUS. Can they hold for a few extra minutes!? Please
@united two economy plus upgrades are not enough to make up for my last 3 flights with you #terrible #annoyed
@JetBlue Is your site having issues? I can't sign into my account.
@ansrthisone @SouthwestAir damn that shit sucks.
@HirlihyBoy @flystl @AmericanAir American Airlines has the worst customer service. I'll pay more to fly another carrier. They're awful.
@SouthwestAir are you going to rebook my cancelled flight (with no explanation) or am I left to fend for myself.
@ImJakePaul @united they should have warned you guys first before throwing you out of the airport. Plain rude and uncalled for.
Hey @united please ensure plane has in seat power if your offering personal entertainment. Nothing worse than device dying during movie
@AmericanAir @AmericanAir What an I incredibly iinappropriate response someone 4 hrs late to their destination.
@AmericanAir -So disappointed!  Couldn't check in online. ticket machine broke and no one at counter so no way to get boarding pass 😳
Worst airline in the United States is United Airline. Don't fly it! EVER!! @United Flown them 6 times and 6 times they have screwed us over.
@itsAbbeyyy guess what....@united is delayed. Surprise surprise. Never on time
@JetBlue delayed 1:30 hours after a damaged control entertainment panel. thanks for the lack of quality!!
About to hit a full. two-hour delay. Just sitting on the tarmac. waiting for our final load weight. or something. #notsnowing @united
@united YOU SUCK!!! How dare you to allow this to happen on your shitty airlines. You can't get away with this!!! http://t.co/LukriVTjbn
@AmericanAir AA1142 delayed and missing my connection at Charlotte....#fail

@united Patience - show me a Refund since you made the 10 hour flight miserable with audio/visual system not working. Time to look at DELTA
@VirginAmerica no longer my favorite airline... flight 0412
#sfo bad weather. flights cancelled behind us. but we found a window. But..wait. what? -- GET OUT OF THE LAVATORY- TIME TO GO @AmericanAir
@united you should be ashamed of yourself and whoever was responsible should be fired!  http://t.co/0RWBh6jx2i
@MetaGrrrl Tall. fat guy @SouthwestAir boarding tactic: buy Early Bird and hope like hell the A group isn't too large.
@united I had terrible flight attendants on my flight today. Very disappointed
@DeltaAssist  @KLM if Flight 9357 left JFK 3 hours late and arrived in Amaterdam after a scheduled connecting flight to Munich. What happens
Hey. @united. I sign up for frequent flyer program and 2 flights in 2 weeks are both cancelled.  What's the scoop? #Grounded
.@JetBlue really testing the penmen patience right now. 4 hour delay. board the plane. leave the gate. go back to the gate.. Brutes
Time warp flight in a very old @AmericanAir plane from Newark to Phoenix. A cross country flight should warrant a decent plane. #fail
Without fail. every flight I take to or from #SanFrancisco on @SouthwestAir is always delayed #annoyed
@DeltaAssist are you kidding me? ANOTHER flight with broken wi fi? Flight 5702 e170... Not the #deltadifference
@Delta @DeltaAssist can you guys explain that while I thought I would board now. I just got a 2 hr delay. Two hours as we should be boarding
@AmericanAir Cancelled dinner b/c told bags would b delivered after 6p.Been waking up every 2 hours 2 make sure didn't miss. What gives?
Another spectacularly shitty experience with @united. I'd say "flying with United" but they can't seem to get us IN THE AIR.
@jetbluescks @JetBlue looks like you have earned a professional troll for your good deed. I hope that you have reported the angry troll. Lol
@SouthwestAir my dad just told me when he returned from his trip last week his luggage had a huge hole and the handle was broken. Any help?
LAX. I hate you. @americanair. you should be ashamed for having only one agent open. You guys get worse each flight.
Looks like @Delta @DeltaAssist owes @mattnathanson a little more than an apology for destroying his guitar. #notshocked
@AmericanAir one man working. two men sitting. been waiting for valet bags for an hour now. Flight AA2569 in DFW B37. http://t.co/pQfSimb4im
Overheard at #LGA. Consensus seems to be that @SouthwestAir and #LGA Terminal B are the worst. Compared to Greyhound station more than once
@pedrosorren @united What a shame United
Will never fly @AmericanAir again!! Will be making a formal complaint in the am! Gave my seats away and it was their fault we were late. #BS
@united fuck you. Your airline is garbage and your service is even more disgusting. It'll only be a matter of time until you're bankrupted
@Scottmeyer @DeltaAssist @Gogo I've been experience the same issue on multiple flights!
After everyone boards the plane you go through each and every passenger and check their IDs after a 20 minute delay?!?!? @SouthwestAir
@DeltaAssist your workers are the rudest individuals I have ever come across and have no idea how to deflect any situation
@SouthwestAir @united @AmericanAir so like on a scale of 1-10 how much shit do you guys take on any given day #tougherthanjosswhedon
@united my friend can't make her trip 30 days from now and you can't refund her. can't let her change name. what can you actually do? #fail
@United United keeps dropping calls to avoid assisting us with rescheduling cancelled flight #6225. Need response asap.
Quite dreadful @JetBlue terrible. awful customer service reps at JFK. 2 hour queue for 1 rep ? Worst airline I've ever used #JustSaying
@AmericanAir WORST and most UNORGANIZED airline I've ever experienced. Been sitting on the plane waiting to take off for 2 hours!#NEVERagain
@united I fly w/ you a lot. But today your constant delays is making me miss one of the most important meetings/opportunities of my career.
@annaclendening @Delta is the worst.  Never fly delta. @SouthwestAir &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or nothing.
@AskAmex great!  Just to confirm my @JetBlue has foreign transaction fees but Delta Gold does not?  Sounds like I may be switching!
@kirsch71 @united Sounds like 3 out of 4 FA's were reasonable. Hopefully the FA who was not. was terminated. 1 person was the problem.
@SouthwestAir Way 2 FUCK UP my Mothers funeral! Do you have any regard 4people that use UR airline? I will never use U again. @JetBlue 4me!!
@united just had my flight home cancelled. been waiting in customer service for a couple hours now. not enough reps. A little help is needed
@kirsch71 @jaketapper @united Eloy now it is your turn to apologize for trying to cheat the system.
Never flying with @JetBlue. You should never treat people the way you treated @MatthewLush. PS-Have fun dealing with our #BoycottJetBlue 🙅✈️
I will never fly @AmericanAir out of #Miami again. If service were any slower Id think think the airport was closed.
@DeltaAssist what happens if int flight delayed over 4 hrs. Still stuck in JFK.
my first @united experience in a while actually has me missing @delta (can't believe i just wrote that)
I'm so sorry you had that atrocious experience @kristen. What on earth is going on with your staff @united? Disgraceful.
@AmericanAir delayed our flight to Dallas twice now and we're going to miss our connect. Came all the way from Aus to live in the airport.
@SouthwestAir this delay is ridiculous: I've never heard of people needing to leave the plane b/c it's too heavy. Can we please leave?
@JetBlue ah man!  2 hour delay flight 164 and then no flyfi?!  Come on now....
@AmericanAir Stuck on flight 1093 waiting on a "tool". Isn't this a major hub with maintenance personnel? 70min &amp; counting
@united got rerouted from @AmericanAir   Rudest ticket agent ever!!!
@united - why is our flight the only flight delayed 3+ hrs due to "air traffic issues"
Is @united the worst airlines ever?!? Yeah I think so!
@united The last 2 weeks I've flown wit u. you have given me 4 reasons to convince me it was a bad decision. Time 2 go back 2 @SouthwestAir
.@AmericanAir today is day 60 since my email/issue with AA and still no contact from anyone. Had been promised to hear within 60 days. Awful
@AmericanAir I will be filing a complaint with my MEP if I don't hear something from you this week.
@DeltaAssist just screwed my travel plans. Crew did not show and no credit for travel or reimbursement!!!!
After a 2 hour delay @united decides to swap out the plane. Basic maintenance omission! Really beginning to dislike this airline!!!
Will NEVER again fly @united! We'll be flying @SouthwestAir from now on!
@united As a 1k flyer I am becoming more disappointed with United. Why no Aloha feeling on flights to Hawaii anymore???
@peteleetweets @AmericanAir How many of them have been all screwed up?!
Dear @SouthwestAir you can have your credit card back. we're over.  This is my last unexplained 3HR delay at Midway.  Is @JetBlue up to par?
@united a plane without in seat power and no WiFi on the ord to sfo route?  #fwp I know but u can do better
No @JetBlue please. take your time. We've only been sitting on the runway waiting to take off for what seems like a day. #ugh #jetblue
@AirlineFlyer @AmericanAir I can never view new Arrivals issues on their first day.  I always get "Object not found. (WWC-50003)".
@SouthwestAir I never received my refund for the slow moving wifi
Never fails @AmericanAir is always late! And no it's not because of the weather in Dallas it's because of "maintenance".. smh
@AlaskaAir seriously second flight in a month over an hour delay. :( I have to work tomorrow... Eta now is after midnight!
@AmericanAir in the mean time. we all pay for old airplanes. Seems unfair
@DeltaAssist Maybe you guys can help find the missing flight attendant for Flight 2929 at JFK.
.@deltaassist To make @delta customer service experience complete: u overcharged bc of incompetence. then canceled plane. &amp; now LOST my bags
Hate @SouthwestAir. no corporate travel should have to deal with this herding of cattle.Good reason to fly @AmericanAir. they give me a seat
@SpiritAirlines since the flight experience is possibly the worst I've ever experienced. isn't it time to learn from the masters @JetBlue ?
I should have left at 5:35.. @AmericanAir  is fucking up
3rd flight cancelled this week. @AmericanAir.  Now have to fly United today. Guess you DON'T learn from mistakes as you assured me.
@citycynic @JetBlue @Jen_eration_x Well that just totally ruined my day.
@AmericanAir made mistake having only 3 elite tiers and making exec plat 120 segments. Have to make switch to @united
Bed time when WiFi doesn't work on @Southwestair as expected. Hope clients aren't pissed. Missed work deadlines. http://t.co/RVxy1Rv8Jx
@deltaassist I received a call that my flight has been switched &amp; now I am not with my original party. What # can I call for help?
@united and another delayed flight.. I think this is 8 in a row... Consistency is important
The day we wrapped series on good service. @AlaskaAir has given worst I've seen. 24hrs at #yyc w/ 2 flight cancellations &amp; 0 communication.
Never flying @VirginAmerica ever again. Talk about rude service and multiple inconveniences.
@DeltaAssist please help I can't make my flight because this plane is delayed so long and I can't find another option
@AmericanAir Forced to check a standard roller bag with $4k tool in it that has fit on every plane ever and being one of first on #nothappy
Holy shit @VirginAmerica website no need to be so cute with this UI. buying tix is stressful enough. Test your site in all browsers please.
@AlaskaAir I'm still in line which hasn't moved. There is one person working the counter. I have never seen anyone who works this slow
@SouthwestAir  on the runway at LGA. 18 hours late after you cancelled my flight.. Still no gate for flight 816. http://t.co/RQEHACcgSO
@DeltaAssist worst flight I have ever had. Moved our seats with out warning. No in flight service and the wifi didnt work. Never again delta
Getting refused to get re-seated by @united . The guy next to me SMELLS LIKE TABACCO! and I'm noshes ! ...
wait wait_ is @JetBlue really adding baggage fees now? _ glad I haven't booked any of my flights for next year_ Hello @SouthwestAir
@JacobWhitesides @AmericanAir ??? IS IT AMERICAN AIRLINES BC THEY BAD
@iamdanmoriarty at least your iPads were working 😉 I waited almost three hours for a 35 minute @AmericanAir flight on Tuesday
@SouthwestAir has the absolute worst customer service in America
@DamonJOfficial @united Ouch! Careless f****! And #1 on top of it all. Should make any guitarist sick and furious as hell.
Every time I give @united another chance to not be terrible they GET WORSE
@JetBlue needs to start paying more attention to the business traveler because @USAirways is awful
@dannysullivan @united @AmericanAir they respond.  Then you dm them. Then you never hear from them again. What a customer service fail
â€œ@ChrisAbdalla_1: Hooray. Going on two hours with this mystery delay @SouthwestAir. A little info from someone would be nice.â€ Hmm
@AmericanAir waiting to park at our gate...#Delayed
Our Russian corer never showed up in Miami. and @AmericanAir seems to have lost my students' frame packs on the flight from MIA to BOS (?!).
@EricaVarley98 @AmericanAir and I met one of your employees they hate it too
On @AmericanAir flight from LAX to DFW. Lil delay because Capt says they need to tape a cargo handle to make sure it closes. #gulp
Stuck in Steamboat. on the phone with @AmericanAir and my call dropped. Please help!
Tomorrow morning many @SouthwestAir flights have already cancelled. Contact @SouthwestAir for any changes to your itinerary.
Thinking of my poor experience with @DeltaAssist reminds me I'm still waiting for @SAS to reply re my complaint 7 months ago! So @SAS?
Hey @jetblue ... Communication on what gate or hell anything would be nice. A gate attendant would be a bonus as well
@DeltaAssist @iopgator HELP! Wife is going to miss connect in ATL
@AlaskaAir I just went through a really bad costumer service experience &amp; because of it now I wont be able to spend the weekend w/ my honey
@united you know y'all are really sad suing that kid. He's not doing anything illegal y'all are just greedy for money!
@DeltaAssist terrible experience on DL5689 on 9JAN. Pls direct message me to discuss terrible cust service and no compensation for cxl flt.
Has anyone ever got a refund for a cancelled @AmericanAir flight? Six months and I’m still waiting…
@AmericanAir Hey. my flight is delayed and they haven't told us anything. What's that about? #unhappy
@DeltaAssist i have flown 6 times and all 6 times i have been delayed...
For 3 weeks of weekly flights. @JetBlue has only let me down. So much for those JD Power customer service awards. #poorcustomerservice
Damn @SouthwestAir. You delaying my flight to NYC is making me miss @chrissyteigen at @lordandtaylor #nyc #delayedflight #lgastinks
@casieg @jetblue It still really sucks. It's sad that they are caving into investor pressure. Can't we just have a non-profit airline?
@united Why am I not on upgrade list? Should be automatic w/ status. Been on hold for 34 min. No response. Email. no response. Please help.
@JensenAckles @AmericanAir What the hell is airport things!
.@AlaskaAir why? RT @mcauliflower: Say your sfo flight to pdx is late... Do you delay it again to load food onto it for 15 min? Alaska does.
Once again. @AmericanAir fails to update passengers about flight delays. #LeftWondering #PoorCommunication
.@HeathrowAirport waiting on @united 97 from Houston #planespotting #travel http://t.co/VVcmIv4I88
Hey @united. maybe if a flight is delayed you make and announcement or put it on one of the monitors instead of not saying anything at all.
@tntradioempire @SouthwestAir Delayed - No plane Todd
@MDGonzales @ctrent @united that's a lot of screwing.
Airlines are ridiculous. @united charges $75 to fly standby when it would save them $ (freeing up my seat for later overbooked flight)
@SouthwestAir this is unacceptable delayed 2 hrs then you give us a broken plane so that we're delayed more remove ur heads from ur asses!
@SouthwestAir I'm having alt of trouble checking in my flight. highly disappointed. Online won't work and I've been on the phone for an hour
@United UA1252 deplaned twice already. Can we get PQM/PQS for each time. This is getting ridiculous
@united I've been on hold for over an hour. There can't possibly be that many people calling. Get it together
Hey @AlaskaAir you changed my seats today at checkin! If I can't have the seats I select at booking. then don't offer them to me! #NotHappy
@AmericanAir I did and no one is answering. This is very poor customer service.
@united if my flight that was supposed to land at 6:40 is cancelled due to weather at EWR why would a flight that lands at 9 get in?
Can the pilot make any more excuses? #seattlebostom @JetBlue
This is disgusting. @united http://t.co/049zcxyU8b
Our flight reservation was arbitratrily cancelled by @United. And they don't even know why. LOL United is a joke airline. Never again.
Oh hi @SouthwestAir! What's up with ur wifi? I paid &amp; it's a fail. Took 3 hrs to send this tweet. This girl's got work to do! Refund plz.
@ClaraHughes_ @united  my husband had a terrible time with United at O'Hare too. Booo! @truenorth74
@AmericanAir #AA208 #NoCustomerService Our flight was delayed 1hr. is it too much to ask for water? Major attitude given by your attendants

@mboute @AmericanAir this nonsense needs to stop ! @AmericanAir needs to show us respect #Haiti
Hey @united. My Flight got cancelled after being delayed a lot. I wasn't offered any compensation beyond a later flight. Can you help me?
@VirginAmerica it’s still the same issue that I raised with you two weeks ago.Just after 3 emails your customer service is plain ignoring me
Hey @united &amp; @AmericanAir Please find my lost bag. What could happen between AUSTIN &amp; ONT???
@VirginAmerica why is your site failing?! Cc @Shevonne_S don't have a cyber Monday sale and a broken website!
Thanks @VirginAmerica for screwing me over

@united you really need to get your gate operations in order; Denver. O'Hare. you name it; what a mess and getting worse
@AmericanAir so far. my connection home is cancelled and the booking agent rolled her eyes at me. was rude and unhelpful. #disappointed
@JetBlue I am terribly disappointed in the lack of resolution to my issue.  Empower your people to resolve issues. Major lack of cust svc
This is not how I wanted to start my holidays. @united and @AmericanAir lost both of my bags. Why pay $60 if I wasn't going to get my bags?
@AmericanAir Just got to SFO. flight was late. so I missed my connection. Can't find anyone to help me get a new flight. Help?
First #United you cancel my flight from IAH to CLT and I had a 5 and a half hour layover at IAH from a 4 hr flight from SEA @united

@DunkinDonuts @JetBlue #DunkinGOSweeps California - I've never seen the west coast
@Wolfiesmom @AmericanAir Sitting on the tarmac again what else is new
@JetBlue no TV on current flight BOS&gt;FLL. Paid full ticket price and got much less than promised. What % refund do you think is fair?
Irritated with @AmericanAir... ...who has time to be on hold. and then be treated rudely!
@AmericanAir you're gate agents are outwardly annoyed and sarcastic. Tried paying for avail. seat upgrade. left feeling 2nd class.
@chigirldc @AmericanAir you can claim for your delayed flight. Check to see if youâ€™re entitled to compensation- http://t.co/gspPqp8Diu
@AmericanAir I know I'm responding late but you messed up the date on return flight admitted it and still charged me to switch her flight
@united dealing with your customer care has been the worst service experience of my life. I am not young.

@united a dozen people on last night's cxl'd ORD-LHR flight due to maintenance issues with TWO different planes now about to miss... (1/2)
I am very disappointed by @VirginAmerica's response to my shattered bubble helmet. Instead of making good they offered a tiny flight credit.
@LANURSE1 @AmericanAir I lost my bag once I arrived back at DFW. It took them 95 days to pay for the Bag that disappeared.
@DeltaAssist pls give update on missing luggage flight FL 724. Jan 6. to Cancun.  Will notify baggage information claim on PM. Can u help?
@kalpenn @AmericanAir how about not being a cheap fuck and paying the $25 bag fee?
.@united. this Airbus A319 has all new seats. wifi. personal device entertainment. but no power under the seat? #fail http://t.co/UcTvLyJRsh
@HoodieAllen @Delta @DeltaAssist || you and @jarpad should get together and talk about fucked up airlines

@DeltaAssist DM2616597916 on DL3976 sitting for deicing for hour? Connect to DL1687 at risk which I can't miss! Priority gate escort please.
Currently on hold for @AmericanAir for 40 min + counting b/c my flight is cancelled! Should have flown @SouthwestAir http://t.co/x33Fzx55Mi
You're the best @SouthwestAir. Putting me up in a hotel even though my missed flight is weather related. @AmericanAir would never do that!
@AmericanAir @aairwaves officially the WORST airline. Lost a day off our vacation and God knows when we will receive our luggage.WORST EVER
@AmericanAir waiting for you to pick up... Coming up on 3 hours now... http://t.co/nOPq5xIsbS
@united Why are you selling cheap upgrades in front of 1K's waiting to clear waitlist for the upgrade they earned? #notfriendly
@SouthwestAir so Im finally on this plane after 3 delays. The pilot just said there is an issue with the sink. Now waiting on maintenance.
Way to go @AmericanAir. 3rd flight of 2015 and every single one was 3+ hours late @coopergreen #fail #newamericanshouldpullitogther #bad
@AmericanAir  booked on AA RNO-LAX.  Have received 4 delay notices so far.   Standard.
@AmericanAir ripped my suitcase bag open. I found my keys on the baggage claim. Fuck you. American Airlines.
No way in hell a round trip for two should be almost $2000 idgaf if it IS a holiday weekend. @SouthwestAir
@DeltaAssist  I can see a wide open @AmericanAir gate. I bet it would fit this MD80! #dl2633 1.5 hours on tarmac.
@DeltaAssist How many people work the phone lines at night?? Been on hold for 1.5 hours!
@AlaskaAir Had a poor cust. svc. exp. just now with flight from SEA-DCA.  Changed seat at check-in. but gate agent undid the change
@AmericanAir How about some flights to STL from ORD?  2 hour delay on inbound is a 15 hour delay RT. Flew SWest instead

.@united IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST AIRLINE EVER.  GOTTA PAY TO WATCH THIS BUMMY SCREEN IN THIS TINY SEAT? C'MON SON. #SMH
@jayrobinson @VirginAmerica it__s not my problem. Her job is to be nice and friendly.
@JetBlue pretty disappointed w trying to buy tix in your app. Won't let me update payment info or select seats--hope I don't lose the fare.
Hey @AlaskaAir FUCK YOU you for PHYSICALLY taking my board out of my hands and them being completely disrespectful to me after
@AmericanAir funny how my mom was delayed and stuck Saturday night and on her return flight tonight it seems to be the same old story..
So flying @united instead of @Delta so far has been a huge disappointment &amp; the flight doesn't leave until Mon. Change fee is ridiculous
#airplane woes. Hearing flight delay due to oil leak. Not comforting @AmericanAir AA388 ORD:( http://t.co/w8R0JAw3I7
@AmericanAir late out of YYZ. barely made connection to SFO at LAX. &amp; now waiting on tarmac 15min bc a plane is at our gate. Come on.
A little disappointed. @SouthwestAir. #ohwell #betterlucknexttime
Disappointed that @SouthwestAir has stopped carrying @vitaminwater . Anyone else feel the same? #SouthwestHeartneedsVitamins
I'm mad @Delta @DeltaAssist change my preferred seat on my flight tomorrow. and now trying to make me pay to change it back #SHADE
Dang my seat area on the airplane smells like dragon breath. @united
@vinnieFM @FrontierCare @SouthwestAir I never don't feel that way! At least we go home the day we left.
@DeltaAssist Furious !! Got bump an hour by @Delta and might miss my Rental Pick up appt ‼️ how can we make this a better day !!!!
@united Just passed &gt;20 ppl waiting for $0 gate check MKE-CLE with 13 bags on belt inc our 3x$25. Why not charge gate check?
@SouthwestAir was just notified my a.m flight from IND&gt;MCI cancelled. SW- not hv other options to get me there. Can you put me on @united?
Woman (@aloria) gets sexually assaulted in @united lounge and denied boarding and then told "sorry for your inconvenience" (@BreakingNews)
@SouthwestAir Disappointed the planes do not have charging outlets! Do any? Pd for Wifi and will run out of battery before landing :(
@AlaskaAir Thanks. Angel. Any idea what the problem was with bags on #109 SEA-ANC last night? A few came out after ~20 min then *nothing*
@AmericanAir how is it possible to not know a part is missing from a PLANE!!  At risk of missing my connection! Ruining my vacation#help
@DeltaAssist No.  Delta was the worst experience I have ever had flying and I will not fly on your airline again.
Whoever set that fire in Chicago this morning is really messing with my weekend. #BostonBound #Eventually @SouthwestAir

Wish I would've flown @AlaskaAir waiting at @Delta terminal forever for my luggage #DeltaAirlines is sooo slow. #poorcustomerservice
@united one of your ground stewardess in HNL failed to listen when we said our final destination was YYZ and now our carry-on check-in is ..
At PBI early enough to catch earlier flight to LGA and @DeltaAssist @Delta is charging me outrageous $$ to get on. WORST AIRLINE EVER
Just had worst customer service at JFK @AmericanAir
@JetBlue Just got back from Boston. Great flight. snacks. tv. wifi there not on return. &amp; Potbelly to-go. No complaints #TrickOrTweet!
@maradydd Bloody hell. I was already keeping away from @united. but this sort of shit makes me reconsider rejoining any Star Alliance line.
@united has once again proven that they do not believe in customer service. #badbusiness
@VirginAmerica yes. I did sign up for your flight alerts feature but it never came
United @united STINKS!  They made my son miss a wedding on NYE because of an ignorant gate agent and only give a lousy $50 voucher?
@JetBlue Thanks for delaying my flight to ny about 6 h!!!
Hey @DeltaAssist any chance you could give my wife a call back? She missed your call back and is on a short break. #CustomerService #dayjob
Almost 48 hrs since I landed in Portland for Xmas vaca w/ the fam and @AlaskaAir still hasn't found my lost baggage. Not feeling optimistic.
@united How about the CEO go sit out under the wing for an hour in a cage in the rain and weather.  Piss poor customer service response!!!
@united Passenger @KristinaRibali is having a horrid time waiting on ORD to Washington DC. and she can't be the only unhappy passenger.
36hrs. still no bags “@AmericanAir: Austan. we show all 5 bags out for delivery. They avg 6 hrs to deliver. but are experiencing delays.”
@united I requested window seat when I reserved my ticket but got a center seat when I checked in via mobile app. Buggy app? #annoyed
@USAirways @AmericanAir do you ever answer your phone? It's really pathetic. #imsodone #badCustomerExperience http://t.co/FxJotaAuAk

@SouthwestAir flight out of Chicago at 10am saying itâ€™s on time (thereâ€™s no way it is). with a 3 hr wait on cust service. Help with status?
I have to wait 2 hours and @JetBlue can't hold a plan they just spoke to 5 minutes for 4 pass. connecting? Cust. serv. says ops. I say fail.
@AmericanAir My big disappointment is the lack of customer service! I follow ur rules. then u blame me!

Its been over a month since issue and still "Pending Review." too busy with the merger? @AmericanAir AA Ref#1-2470146097
@united Flight 1169 SFO &gt; LAX is late due to equip swap. NOT late arriving aircraft. Why so dishonest? #southwestair http://t.co/X8uB9G0yMd
holy fuck. @SouthwestAir you're all gigantic pieces of shit.
@VitalyKroy yeah you look like a big dude. That would suck indeed. I try to always fly @SouthwestAir so I generally can pick my seat mates
Got on my @VirginAmerica flight today to realize yall switched my aisle seat to a middle one that doesnt recline. im claustropobic. Great.
Another lost bag by @united   At least you guys are consistent! #epicfail http://t.co/ToMbBVghii
@united stranded in Newark after a cancellation yesterday + then delay which led to missed connection tonight. Hotel voucher for the night?
@AmericanAir just spent 45 mins on hold 2have your sales person tell me Id only get assigned seats paying $150 or wait till I get to airport
Come on @united .. 35 minutes and counting to get flight 1247 to a gate in IAH. No gate available?? Really? #sad #badservice
@united I have been on the phone with your Customer "Service" team for 65 minutes now trying to change a flight. You put the 'U' in sUck.
@SouthwestAir The flight attendants were terrible from KCI to Chi I've never been addressed so many times on 1 flight in all the flyin we do
@SouthwestAir your employee made a mistake and now I am having to pay for it. Stuck without clothes for a wedding tomorrow. Need help please
Total shitshow at #MIA with @AmericanAir. Wait in line to check in on frozen kiosks. Wait in line to drop checked bags. Wait. Flawed system
7 delays and 1 canceled flights? Come on. @SouthwestAir #holdthatplane
@VirginAmerica It's cyber monday and you have a huge deal - didn't you anticipate a lot of web traffic? #slow #websitefail
@LanasTwittah @AmericanAir American &amp; Delta are the worst! Gotta use @JetBlue or @VirginAmerica
So my @united flight is delayed   5 hours because they don’t have a plane! Only a minor issue for an AIRLINE!!! 💩✈️
@united Just called MileagePlus per your recommendation. nothing different from what I could read online. Disappoint after waiting 30 min.
@DeltaAssist I hope you fuckers get sued.
@omarsuleiman504 @united disgusting from United. Fix up.
@AmericanAir I hate you
I don't remember the time when I wasn't delayed while flying with United Airlines. So unreliable. @united
@SouthwestAir telling someone to wait 1 HOUR for their bag is completely unacceptable. I might leave you over this! #Flight646 #Fail
@JetBlue so disappointed. It is chaos in JFK. Not fare to take LGA as first priority before us. #trulydisapointed #hiremorepilots
@DeltaAssist damaged lug. Went to baggage services &amp;was told theyre not liable for it. Had to convince rep to file a claim. No call. Nothing
@bwzimmerman @USAirways @AmericanAir yeah. they suck bad. Change gates all the time at Logan and never a peep from my phone.
@united Actually you don't. It said "non-refundable" nowhere on my reciept/ticket and the rules were hidden behind a faulty CAPTCHA page.
@VirginAmerica hey there! I'm having issues with this promo.
@kufavs @advertisingweek I’m very upset Santa didn’t bring me an upcycled @SouthwestAir bag for Christmas.
Alright @united you stranded us and ruined Christmas in LA last year. Edmonton to Denver then Boston. You got this #youhaveonejob
@united cancelled my flight and customer service failed to actually book the ticket on the next flight. Now on standby:( see my DM please!!
Don't fly American Airlines or Us Airways! When something goes wrong they'll tell you "its not their problem" @AmericanAir @USAirways
@SouthwestAir why. oh why. is the wait for my baggage at LGA longer than my flight from Chicago? Five flights on one luggage carousel????
wow having the worst customer experience of my life with @VirginAmerica literally not a soul can help me find a lost item...
Really. @AmericanAir?!  Charged 3 times for same ticket during YOUR system melt &amp; no #refund. no help 1 month later. #worst #customerservice
@united @anthonythomas93  Ya you guys suck
@SouthwestAir I don't know why SWA would rather leave 215 passengers abandoned in Austin for 4 hours than keep a 50cent light bulb in stock
@DeltaAssist @Delta if you know there is a departure delay why would you push the plane off the gate and make us sit on a taxiway? Dl1259
@AmericanAir how is the first flight to Chicago delayed from philly?? Epic fail 4307
@JetBlue why did the $100 promised credit from flight 807 on march 17 get switched to $50 a week later? please explain
@DeltaAssist my wife is having a hell of a time getting out of Canada. She was there in Emry of time and they have her seat away.
Shame on @united ! RT @good: Passengers shout "leave her alone!" as United Airlines removes girl w/autism from flight http://t.co/NBSqgEyR0c
@united  #OVEHJ5 I would have stayed put for 2 more days and NOT wasted my mileage to get back home!  All this loyalty for punishment?
Stuck on our plane for an hour and going to miss my connecting flight... So Feliz Navidone @SouthwestAir
1: Do NOT waste your time flying with @united - wasn't allowed on because I arrived 35 minutes before the departure of a delayed flight!
@AmericanAir yeah bullshit. You've been saying that for years. Just admit you couldn't care less about South American routes
So apparently those cost synergies didn't take into effect yet @AmericanAir @USAirways This the third consecutive worst flight experience
Hey @united. what's up with the #debacle surrounding flight UA1001? Just a mess here at Cancun International. http://t.co/YtfLugTJsA
@michellevisage @Delta @DeltaAssist I think Michelle may have got her hair stuck in the overhead compartment...?
@AmericanAir you have flights listed on your website that are not avail. I booked over a month ago and was just told its a missed connection
Unassigned seats on @SouthwestAir is frustrating when you're 6'6" #exitrowplease
Didn't get a food option on my international @AmericanAir flight. Sitting in the back= worse treatment
You should be ashamed of yourselves @united. That is all.
Terrible treatment from @Qantas this morning!! @AmericanAir
Ah! @united re-routed us thru Chicago on a diff airline. Orig. plane is delayed and this is the only way we'll make connection to London.
@united   Is it because we arrived 90 minutes late that no one can tow us into the gate?  Unbelievable.
@SouthwestAir your delays are really killing me.
@DefeatedGoliath @VirginAmerica At a few points I felt like I was dealing with @comcast. No. wait. Comcast reps are at least nice.
@ToddTVG @SimonTVG @AmericanAir  Once again proving they're the WORST.  You should have demanded flight on another airline
not surprised that @JetBlue has continued their streak of rudeness and unprofessionalism
. @united  leaving me out hundreds of $$ in hotel and an entire tank of gas making FIVE trips to the airport. to get NOWHERE. Worst ever.
Again @AmericanAir ? Explain me this. how is my parents fault not making their flight when u change the gate twice?
@jetblue we never received that $15 credit for inoperable tv's on our SFO &gt; JFK flight 2 weeks ago. never got an email...
Day 5 of vacation. Still waiting for luggage from a @AirCanada / @AlaskaAir transfer flight.Never fly either if they lost bag.#Cabo #travel
It's confirmed. @united fail. Again
Rudest @SouthwestAir gate rep I've ever come across. Gate B11 Chicago Midway. If you hate your job. then quit.
@NotCommonFacts @JetBlue not a good way to treat customers!
@ColleenB123 @AmericanAir why is every airline awful?
@united no we have arrived home now. yet another bad experience flying with you guys!
@united flight was delayed today by attndnt that was "stuck in traffic". I missed my cnnction. Also miss my sons first bball pratice 2night.
@swershing @united "waahhhn why wont you take off if there's a safety issue with the plane wahh" Platinum with both D &amp; U. They're the same.
@curtbuthman @AmericanAir @MarshaCollier @Box_Pipe Getting bumped. unheld reservation. etc... among the very worst customer service fails
@united if you're going to promote having WiFi please make sure it works..flight1212 six hours no WiFi or video entertainment #fail #again
@AmericanAir checked status. promised by 3. no call/delivery. I called back. 2 hrs on phone. told 2 pick up Pearson and  #RIDICULOUS
@AmericanAir u.s. air backed up ticketing. and then told the 20 people who missed the flight that we should have gotten their sooner.
@VirginAmerica Trying to contact someone re lost &amp; found on recent flight to ORD. Any help appreciated!
@DeltaAssist What's going on with DL1106? We've been waiting to board for 20 minutes.
@SouthwestAir your literally the worst airline ever ðŸ˜¡ how does a 52 min flight turn into a 3 hour journey
I know you must hear this all the time. but I'd like to add my voice to the chorus. Fuck you @united
Hi @united so for some reason you didn't put my bags on my flight to Costa Rica. Now I have no clothes. Can you please help? This stinks
What happened @SouthwestAir for #flight 512? I have been at the airport since 9 am. #travel #Orlando #LA #patientlywaiting #delay #director
@united gave me a voucher for my overbooked flight seat than took it back when the plane didnt leave bc of engine failure #NeverAgain #Fail
@JetBlue Kicking 6'4 girl out of empty exit row cuz she didn't pay upgrade. Our travel party of 20 will find a new airline to fly next time.
Once again my flight on @united is late. I rarely have an on time flight w them! #frustrated
@united you better have someone check Facebook post of  hero Marcus Luttrell and the over 18000 negative comments re your airline.  #txfrog
On a late @united flight between Houston and San Fran http://t.co/sIfW702h5T
@VirginAtlantic @VirginAmerica Tweeted yesterday have had no response :( a simple no would have sufficed rather than be ignored.
Very upset the 14000 miles I expected to get on a @united ticket bought back in OCTOBER will only be 5.000 because I depart 6 days into Mar!
@DeltaAssist JFK a mess today. Gates changing. 2hr delay and no-one knows where the actual plane is we are supposed to be taking DL438
.@AmericanAir AA 3674 switched gates but no email notification. screen @ old gate doesn't indicate change. Also has wrong boarding time. F-
My @USAirways flight is hot as hell. No air conditioning since auxiliary power is turned off but apparently @AmericanAir needed the parking
"@gsterling: What's worse than no onboard WiFi? @united WiFi. Having AOL dial-up flashbacks. Wasted hours ...  #firstworldproblems
@DeltaAssist your jfk baggage loaders are way behind schedule.  1 hr delay!  @smw04 @
"@kylekinane: Haven't gotten laid in a while? Fly @united. They'll totally fuck you." @laurakbrand looks like united is still killing it
Because. why not? Screw the customer. RT @SunSentinel @JetBlue will no longer offer first checked bag free http://t.co/P4E9iit2m2
@EddieTrunk @united and yet the "budget" airline @SouthwestAir gives you TV and snacks . I hate united and usairways is same as united
@jsomething2 You know that they stop you doing that so you donâ€™t kill everyone elseâ€™s connection. yeah? @WandrMe @PanasonicAero @united
@united Why isn't your crew here 20 minutes after boarding is supposed to have started. I miss @Delta
@united Reviewed other tweets. Not sure if you can do anything except write heart warming tweets while other United members create mess
Just cancelled my @jetblue flight to NYC flight next week. What if the pilot judged &amp; pointed at me because I was gay?
@americanair i can take a delayed flight for some real shit but delays because you are to cheap to (cont) http://t.co/3lHYyV6WIv
@Delta ripped my checked bag on my way to vacation. Now it's impossible to pack it to get home. @DeltaAssist #nothappy
@AmericanAir why aren't chairmans is air upgrades clearing 7 days out any more? We have to wait until 24 hours. Defeats purpose of benefit
I just used @Delta @DeltaAssist call back system so I wouldn't sit on hold. They called back. and then I got minutes of on hold music...
@united you take the cake for the WORST customer service. which is why you filed for bankruptcy in 2002.
@united airlines lost my bag full of food. and now I'm going to have to most probably throw everything out :( What a waste.
@united never heard back from you!!!
@AmericanAir Hi. I can't get a response to my recent customer relations email or reach a CR phone rep for a direct answer. very frustrated.
@JetBlue Ok The fairy flight delay has been lifted. I need an ATC clearance before I take off-Tonight i am fairy flying from ORH to FLL
Major non-weather related delay here and flight canceled back. Next time I'm driving! @AmericanAir http://t.co/6XlX7XsOYp
@AmericanAir fuck you Motherfuker
Never flying @AlaskaAir ðŸ™…ðŸ»
@AmericanAir It's ridiculous that u charge $1400 2 change itinerary!  refuse 2 wave it due 2 bereavement!  Way too cruel! #howinconsiderate
@DeltaAssist Issue was the gate agent at SLC to SEA flt 1857. Came from HNL without issue. Headed to ANC. Will
@united I spent over 3 hours speaking w/ agents at United. No solution. Dumped us on @AlaskaAir who went above &amp; beyond. Poor #CustServ
Sitting by the gate waiting for my flight with @AmericanAir to SNA now delayed an hour. #FridayFlight https://t.co/khu6CYgXnK
@VirginAmerica sent DM and no response?
@united I submitted my complaint.  Will someone respond by email?
@AmericanAir  American eagle as envoy air flights are like riding in a #hunkofjunk #horrifying shameful to charge what you do!
@OJessicaNigri Did @SouthwestAir pay for your suitcase damage? Don't be jerks. SouthwestAir!
@united has now switched my gate three times and delayed me 15 min because of so many delays. Who organizes this stuff. a 2nd grader?
Being a Gold member has its benefits I guess. unless you have been on hold with @AmericanAir for over 2 hours #hiremore #makebillions
@curtisstigers @united I am just thankful that Heathrow didn't let you down by cancelling - or else you might still not be home.  xxx
delayed in El Paso by @united trying to get to Houston... something about a landing light broke... ETA still unknown :(
I get irrationally upset when @usairways clubs don't have the yogurt pretzels that @americanair clubs have. #platinum #toomuchtravel
@united stuck on the tarmac at LGA flight 299 to ORD. Going to miss connection to MCI at 12:08. What's next flight I &amp; @ryanngro can get on?
Wow. Just heard about @JetBlue kicking a passenger off a flight because of a critical tweet. Absolutely ridiculous and abusive.
@united when is flight 1507 from sfo to Vegas leaving? We've been delayed 90 minutes already and are just sitting at the gate
@USAirways @AmericanAir really? Flt cancelled 12 HOURS ahead BC a crew issue?! Surely u have backup I mean that's y my friends r "on call"
@blackenterprise that's because @AmericanAir customer service is horrible and their losing business. I was once a loyal customer.
Disappointed w/ @united's response to my sitting on a plane for 3 hrs after a 4 hr flight w/ no food the entire time. Poor customer service.
@delta gave you Another chance even though every flight w u has been fucked and again 1 hr delay today to LAX @deltaassist #theworst #delay
@united https://t.co/xYr6Bw1LrT do you have a response to negative comments here?
@united But I didn't know the dates. Now you guys had no option to reschedule with out a date and hence I had to cancel #dissapointing
@AmericanAir Flight 4131 to St. Louis is delayed. 60 mins ago we were told we'd be updated after 20 mins. Gate crew vanished 30 mins ago..?
@SouthwestAir this is the worst flight ever! Delays and poor communication by your staff is a joke $100 voucher is not enough. Flight302
Hey @SouthwestAir can someone PLEASE respond to my #rapidrewards issue https://t.co/xQzvPOz5yj
@VirginAmerica I've had super frustrating 24hours trying to work with you b/c you were my fav airline but might rethink that now #frustrated
@AmericanAir Customer Relations NEVER responded.  Not surprised. Haven't even gotten miles and segments from 8/1 flights. Unprofessional.
@SouthwestAir Seems like waiting over 35 minutes to speak to someone about #rapid rewards is a bit long. Still waiting...
@AmericanAir Day 9. no response!  How long does it take to "do a careful review"?
I demand someone from @united to contact me. You're making me miss my friends wedding. Should've flown @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir we made it luggage and all! A few hours late but where is the excitement in being on-time
Shame on you. @united. https://t.co/qhcKQexZlD
@AmericanAir I realize your agents are busy but at least provide a way to schedule a callback. How do I rebook my cancelled flight?
@AmericanAir is there any point to the priority tag on the bag??? Another fail.
@AmericanAir @jpromi2 yes Joe ORD isn't under their travel alert they are just canceling flights there. Your bad.
@americanair is trash. Paid $75 for "extra legroom" which is made up nonsense now over 2 hours delayed. Want refund for phantom surcharge
â€œ@L1LDebbie: The worst airlines @united never ever fly with them. They are unprofessional. rude. and lazy !!!â€ Damn I would say US Airways
@united  At least on my return. the flight (UA 28) was canceled and I'm about 7 1/2 hours late getting to EWR. It has really been swell.
@AmericanAir Is there is a delay for EQM hitting my account for an @AlaskaAir flight that is an AA codeshare?
@markasaurus @united Now I know why I'm having issues ..My flight was $260 to $272 to $312 all within 30 mins. @Delta is getting my $$ now.
Been there. Sad @United MT @mattbai: The iPad I left on a plane last month? Someone found it. At my seat. where @united said they looked.
American Airlines flight from Dallas to LAX delayed then bumped down to a smaller plane. Ugh! Bummer. #EpicFail @AmericanAir
@DeltaAssist Before we start. can you please give me your executive complaint procedure?
You know for a cool airline you have some rude and unprofessional customer service reps over the phone @VirginAmerica
@southwestair please help me with my ticketing problem. No one has responded.
Thank you. @JetBlue for giving me JetBlueballs b/c you led me to believe I was finna "GET" my luggage upon arrival. but...you lost that shit
Second time in 3 months my @JetBlue flight is delayed by almost 2 hours. I just wanted a relaxing weekend! #ugh #getittogether cc @WKidston
Seething. Not only did @americanair delay my flight by 7 hours -- now they've lost my luggage. too. You have to be kidding me. Horrible.
I thought @united would be the worst airlines I ever flew on.. Today @SouthwestAir took the cake..
@AmericanAir why was flight 249 randomly delayed almost 3 hours? Is this to make up for my flight that actually left on time on Tues?
Uh why is my previously confirmed flight itinerary no longer showing up online?? @JetBlue what's happening right now?
@SouthwestAir seriously? No window shade? Hope nothing else is broken on this plane. #maintenance
Could you repeat the safety instructions @united ? I couldn't hear them over the smell of engine exhaust in the cabin.....
@AmericanAir hey you guys have lost my luggage twice in the same week. This unacceptable and I don't have access to my medication now
@JetBlue how can I confirm my flight is cancelled?
@cregeta12 @united United's response delayed like their flights? Help Nepal and Nepalese get relief supplies soon please!
Hey @united wonder how come on @AmericanAir @USAirways @SouthwestAir @Delta I can always get PreTSA but never on your airline? You different
@AmericanAir never issues with other airlines. Mom with two toddlers should not have to worry about getting put on a flight 4 hours later.
.@united still waiting for response back from Customer Support @united as why my 4 month old was put thru a 'random' security check at #YYC.
@united again. I've been sitting on tarmac for 40 mins still in Houston. Will miss my connection to London. Terrible service. Period.
@DeltaAssist. what's happening in DC? Just landed @JFK and heard all flights to BWI. DCA &amp; IAD are cancelled. Need to get home 2 DC 2nite!
@SouthwestAir how does a computer inside a suitcase full of clothes get dented? How do screws on a remote control get bent? A Lil too rough?
@SouthwestAir I have 2 people that are going to miss their flight at 9:15 from Tampa to Columbus. Can u help?
Still waiting at the airport. Past departure time. Still hoping to be able to sing on the show. No update on anything from @AmericanAir
@kumailn @VirginAmerica My wife left an iPod on a flight and called customer service within an hour of deplaning. Response was don't bother.
Not cool @JetBlue "You're Not Going To Be Like The Big Change Coming To JetBlue" http://t.co/mXKsOZ17lt via @HuffPostTravel #JetBlueFail
@fly2ohare what's the deal w/ planes waiting an hr on Tarmac after landing for gate? AA3620 still no gate! Ppl need to connect @AmericanAir
@CNN @SouthwestAir @CNNTravel should never happen
Hey @united. thanks for nothing worst airline.  Figure how how to get a plane boarded.  @VirginAmerica has
@AmericanAir + @USAirways My morning flight #826 just got cancelled to Charlotte but I need to make a connection to SJO. On hold #HELP
WHOA... When the hell did @JetBlue ditch the @GolfChannel? This is a goddamn travesty!!!!!
@Lonely_Dad @united shut up dad u fucking whiny asshole
@SouthwestAir I want me $8 back.  Your wifi sucks.
@AmericanAir I went to check in for my flight this morning and it says it's been cancelled. I received no notice of any problems!
@AmericanAir sitting on plane in Columbus. supposed to leave an hour ago. Now the mechanic can't find a tool to service the shock absorber.
@kristen  @united this is TERRIBLE!  #BYEKeith #gowithFelicia
@united Need help! A friend is trying to leave San Juan at 4pm with his GF for an emergency MRI in LA tonight but can't get a seat with her
.@JetBlue Sad to hear you've compromised your core values to please your investors.Always saw you as a standout against the status quo
Flying with @united is like dating a girl who is always late and doesn't really care about your plan. Be expecting the unexpected.
@SarahBlackwood1 It seems like these flight attendants @united never were toddlers. I wonder what their parents have to say.
Oh &amp; btw. @AmericanAir in Philly SUCKS. Service was terrible
@DeltaAssist I didn't have the money for a hotel room to leave tomorrow. No one is offering any assistance. I won't fly delta again.
At what point does @americanair cancel a flight? 7:00 flight now delayed to 10:30!
@DeltaAssist need help getting home off of a mysterious "delay" STI-JFK-PDX
ahh. my first trip on @SouthwestAir is also my last.  Delay to Baltimore from Cleveland. and now sitting on the tarmac for 30 min IN Balt.
@AmericanAir she had a connecting flight that was delayed. Are hostess said the other flight was going to be delayed and she went to the +
Oh @united airlines delayed my flight? What a surprise ðŸ˜’
2 hour 20 min delay... @AmericanAir you're killing me. At least I have no where to be tonight 👌
@AmericanAir you canceled my flight and won't let me get through to an agent. The one you switched me to doesn't work for me. Please respond
@SouthwestAir Flight delayed ok. I get it. but now on board and stuck here for who knows how long... Worst day ever!
@americanair I have a flight this eve (MMH -&gt; LAX) that I'm no longer taking. Can I transfer it to a friend?
@fark Ridiculously accurate list.  I still vote @united and @comcast as tied for worst company in history.  ;)
@DianeNeal @united So sorry you are dealing with this. I've had it with airline issues!
@SouthwestAir on a complete full flight 1614 Dal-Den. you allowed a passenger that needs two seats to wedge in the middle. Unacceptable.
@JetBlue your customer service is a joke #flight1201 #delayed #delayed #delayed
"Maintenance issue" is B.S. excuse du jour for @united Back 2 back plans afflicted. Result: Get in at least 4 hrs late. miss Easter w/ kids
â€œ@IAmJericho: Other people may like that joke. but me? Nacho much. @HEELZiggler @AmericanAir @AndyKindlerâ€ You guys ruined comedy for me
@DeltaAssist - can you please help find the lost bags from the fco flight that was a code share with Alitalia? #aznocustomerservice
.@AmericanAir even after I lost my upgraded seats because of your detouring me to DFW when you knew you had already canceled 300+ flights?
Thank you Wall Streets so-called analysts! You ruin @JetBlue for many passengers! Only @SouthwestAir is holding on to free bags in 2015!
@AmericanAir bad experience when the plane has maintenance issues. board us anyways &amp; make us sit on the plane for an hour.
@AmericanAir @USAirways Spent over an hour on your horrible systems/ phone lines just to try to change seats AND was charged twice...
Maybe the most disappointed I've ever been in myself: just remembered to checkin for tomorrow AM's flight &amp; got C boarding @SouthwestAir ðŸ˜©
@AmericanAir more travel headaches. Ugh!
@SouthwestAir when you re-routed me to MDW. it disconnected me from my group  &amp; has me getting to MBJ hours later so I will miss my ride
@united weird after my terrible experience booking the flight. my flight took off over an hour late &amp; I missed my connecting
Noooo!!! @AmericanAir Flight 51 from LHR&gt;DFW is no longer on the 77W?? That is the reason I booked that flight. wanted WiFi!!!
Should have known from previous experience to never. ever fly @United #WORST
From unwilling to book me on a rival airline to putting me up in a bug infested hotel @AmericanAir has caused me to miss my moving day. Fail
Hmm. Why didn't @united let me know my flight was delayed 2 hrs? I gave up my seat at the bar &amp; some beer. Did Dallas score?
I'm leaving on a jet plane quite early this am.  Miss my family already. #werkcalls Happy to be flying @VirginAmerica...
Shame on you @united......Shame on you.  Glad I booked with another airline.
BOO.. Looks like @USAirways is going to adopt the @AmericanAir frequent flyer policies.. #FAIL May move by business back to @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir has the WORST customer service/relations I've ever encountered. because it apparently doesn't exist.
@AlaskaAir it would be awesome if your app printed itinerary changes when there is a mechanical... Going to miss my flight today!
@united anyone want to respond to my complaint on lost &amp; opened luggage both to &amp; from my destination + this "joke" http://t.co/YGRF6t65UM
@camerondallas @AmericanAir ANSWER HIM OR ILL KICK YOU IN THE THROAT
Another delay. Just get me to Chicago please. @SouthwestAir
When you miss a flight due to your own negligence. atleast you know where to place the blame. @united #airlineofchoice
@AmericanAir missing important interview. 7 hour delay. #unacceptable
@bvkcitizen That's clearly poor service. but just so you know @united does not hire Skycaps. That's a seperate service run by the airport.
@DeltaAssist very mad about my lost luggage !! this is ridiculous never flying with you again
@AmericanAir get turned back to the gate for missing paperwork. now not enough fuel to get to Dallas. really? Cutting it close a little?
@AmericanAir @USAirways y'all just lost a customer. Delayed flight. was assured we'd make connecting. connecting took off early. #GRIMEYSHIT
@DeltaAssist just tried to call delta to cancel my flight and wait time is 4 hours. help!!
@AmericanAir flight cancelled. moved to another. want to cancel. It says call.. it's been hours. Worst is that online cancel isn't allowed.
@AmericanAir I bought this upgrade to first class. Starting to wonder why. Stewards are rude. no extra service. and I paid a grip of $$$$
@united Are you guys aware of what is going on with flt 5026? You've added delays to it all day long. Ugh! http://t.co/LltBpCa5vI
@AmericanAir at lax and again horrible rude service as a priority customer for years I was told I am not charged for bags and sent away!
@DeltaAssist - messed up the flight for my honeymoon. even has first class. Wish you guys would help fix the problem. @Delta
I am never flying @Delta @DeltaAssist @DeltaNewsroom  they have lost then found then lost my luggage again. Now offered me $25. Smdh
@JetBlue scariest take off ever. Flight 915 to SFO. I've never been so scared before. Thank God for free wifi.
change fee's on @AmericanAir are crazy. never flying with them again!
@DeltaAssist all flights to/from Wausau has been cancelled the past 3 days. We were delayed over 30 hours just getting here
@AmericanAir never buying an AA ticket again.
And now the flights are delayed and no updates. Boo @united  Such poor service.
