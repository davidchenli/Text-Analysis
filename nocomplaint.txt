Despite a wind delayed 6hr 45 min return flight @VirginAmerica truly is the best domestic airline.  Push a button and wine arrives.
@QuranWeekly @united this is wrong and we know it. Disgusting behaviour and I wish I was there with that sister.
A salute to the folks at @united who never fail me. #thankyou #flyerfriendly #sfo http://t.co/wKwRQTtgtu
@AmericanAir SCREW YOU @jeromejarre justwantstomake someoneday a little bit brighter and bringa smileto theirface. #AmericanAirlinesCHILLOUT
We've had some complaints about @united lately but I have to say. they took care of us when we got stuck in Chicago last night! #travel
Okay @Delta. it's been years since I've flown anything but @SouthwestAir. Let's see if you're as terrible as I remember.
Guys @VirginAmerica switched the almonds to roasted chickpeas in their snack boxes and I still don't know what to think about it.
Yooo Joey. tweet these bad boys @madflavor  @AmericanAir
@QuranWeekly @united  Too many bigots in America.  I was raised in Idaho. Worse than Alabama.
On my flight home. First Class: don't know if I wana break the seal or wait for this #titosvodka  @AmericanAir
@leagueexpress  Wakefield v Leigh. Error strewn but an enthralling game. Arsenal@united will need to wait.
@AmericanAir Stuck in paradise! Evac'ed from St John due to hurricane but flight isn't until tomorrow. Any way to get out today?
@staringispolite @PhilzCoffee Wait. people fly airlines that aren't @VirginAmerica?
Goodbye Florida. You will be missed. Back home to Wisconsin and the cold.. @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir I am waiting for him to text it to me now.
@JLJeffLewis @AmericanAir @USAirways @Jennipulos oh Jenni please don't cry! You know it's bad if Jeff is the one comforting u!
@JetBlue Appreciate the response! For clarification: surveys load blank pages that don't allow you to move forward. Huge time waste.
@CortJstr You're flying @VirginAmerica aren't you? I hate that they have no direct flights to Vegas from Dulles.
I hate to admit it. but I really like the new @united safety video.
@withhearts @JetBlue is the way to go.  No baggage fees. unlimited snacks. tv. great prices.
@JetBlue AMAZING customer service when I had to cancel my flight due to your rescheduling.  No fuss and full refund!  Thanks!
@JetBlue thank you for your quick response and fixing our problem! Great customer service :)
@VirginAmerica @flySFO REALLY? The Mega Storm isn't here and my flight to SD is 2.5 hours late?! Keep me safe. yes. but sane would be good.
#UCCan benefit plans members: give us your email &amp; never miss updates on pay/pension/benefits! MinistryandEmployment@united-church.ca
@DeltaAssist is flight 468 from jfk to tel aviv still scheduled to leave on time?
@AmericanAir never done anything like mum wanted to before she's 80. So we're coming!!
F'ing weather. Wife's flight to to Paris canceled due to weather on east coast. Grrrrr. Hope @DeltaAssist  can come through.
@DeltaAssist are there plans to issue a waiver because of rain/snow/ice in ATL on Wed or is it too early for that?
What the heck is @JetBlue's Mosaic program? Heard the flight attendant mention it 6 times in 2 mins.
A Better Way To Find The Best Flights And Avoid The Worst Airports http://t.co/PxYBWa3j4G Congrats @FlyPDX and @AlaskaAir on the rank
@JetBlue gotcha. there's a special birthday boy on flight 833 having a rough night on the tarmac. Was hoping to give him some good news
@OneMileataTime @AmericanAir Wait. really? You're living life. wrong. then.
I have @AlaskaAir MVP status now for the rest of the year and I don't know if I will be able to use it--how sad is that!
@JazzShaw @DeltaAssist here's a bag of peanuts while you wait
@AmericanAir Please take care of my bae in 39A on #174 tonight. Can't wait to see her in London in the morning!
@AmericanAir what is the number to check the status of a damaged bag?
Flying @VirginAmerica is great except for the dreadful safety tips "music video." A sharp stick in my ear is preferable. "Robot rap." guys.
@KepanisLaw @VirginAmerica very sad. I wear very expensive perfume and would never want this to happen. I love @VirginAmerica as well :/
So we took off late. which made me miss my original connecting flight but they had it fixed by the time i landed. Good job @AlaskaAir
@ImamSuhaibWebb @TaheraHAhmad @united I'm so sorry this happened to you. People are so ignorant these days. You didn't deserve that.
@AmericanAir the express jets are frightening. Old crappy 900. http://t.co/kZQNjFHe2O
@united flight 1234 out of PIT cancelled. And options out of neighboring airports? CMH? Got 4 guys that need to be in Houston tomorrow.
How much did @AmericanAir pay to be in The Fault in our Stars? #productplacement
@arielwinter1 @AmericanAir @ASPCA Sorry to hear about your bad flight experience Ariel. :( I've read a lot of bad tweets about that airline.
#Worst nightmare. Sitting beside the largest man that smells like sweat &amp; beer..There is NO SEATS to move. @AmericanAir. Not your fault.
Flying awful @SpiritAirlines makes me REALLY appreciate @JetBlue. How about you guys fly direct to everywhere from now on. ok 'Blue? Thx.
@AmericanAir email received. It says my property wasn't located. Perhaps you missed the problem: I got my baggage after 3 days. I'm...
â€œ@hindukid1021: prime example of our world today @united http://t.co/w8RBIeHPH1â€ this is so sad
@VirginAmerica Thank You for everything. there is nothing but love from here. I hope that issue is resolved and didn't happen to others
Thanks also to @JetBlue for a great &amp; affordable trip! Awesome proactive service dealing w a minor issue on return flight! #88Roadtrip
@SouthwestAir Is there any anticipation that this flight will be cancelled or delayed tomorrow? http://t.co/yrAGYPAEqi

@DeltaAssist @Delta my friend is on her first intl trip. Her wallet was stolen an they won't let her board without the credit card! HELP!
This is why @americanair @united @delta need to shut their mouths. Shame on you US-based airlines. http://t.co/9KrHPM6rLq
@JetBlue thx for police respect. Protesters R assholes. Fuck em. #jetbluenypd
Flight option for tomorrow on @United is a 45 minute connection in IAD from the A pit to mid C. That's a very bad idea.
No. they were not sorry at all. Fly @VirginAmerica or @AmericanAir. much more pleasant. #Rude #NickleandDime #Delta  https://t.co/eOA1W4JdC9
@OneRepublic @united omg I just can't wait !

@Heather_Poole @hharteveldt @SouthwestAir They will never be Braniff. They need to stop trying.

@DeltaAssist looks like I will miss my connection in SLC at 3:08. You have another way to get me to Portland?
After years of @united switched this week to @AmericanAir and got an upgrade on my first flight. A promising start!
@Jetblue I'm so sorry I cheated on you with @Delta @DeltaAssist. Please take me back. I wore protection.
RIP @JetBlue! Was the best. now another poor option. Latest: Not honoring lower fares for TrueBlue. Flew @AA this week &amp; may shift entirely.
@rakeshlobster @AmericanAir .  Oh you poor thing.  Douchbag.
@united Estimated wait time for customer service: 35 minutes.
Twitter analysis suggests best and worst airlines. @virginamerica for the win http://t.co/dvxaWBI6iU via @forbes
@AAdam_flyer @AmericanAir No one likes to wait in line. but instead of fixing it. we'll just tell you to be patient. :-) #goingforgreat
Also the agent who booked our flight for us to leave JFK I paid extra to leave from LGA. Can u find us a new flight from LGA?@JetBlue
@united surprisingly hasn't ruined my trip yet! Hopefully I'm not jinxing myself for the last leg
@JensenAckles @AlaskaAir You SPN boys have the worst luck with air travel!
Should have listened to @VirginAmerica when they said 39% chance of delay ðŸ˜£
After almost 20k miles flying with @AlaskaAir this year I'm so glad I switched to them! #IFlyAlaska
@JetBlue yup! June 12th heading to Fort Lauderdale... Can't wait
Oboard a #united flight .... I MISS YOU @SouthwestAir .... I wish I could fly you everywhere!!! Start flights to Palm Springs Please!!!!!!!

@SouthwestAir reported that there are 21 cancellations and all flights have been delayed. For more info. please contact the airline.
This new _bid to upgrade_ feature for @VirginAmerica flights is neat. If I was flying longer than 2 hours I__d try it out.
@Alancumming @JetBlue also offers lie flat beds. Awwwwwwwwyissss. P.s. Next time I come to cabaret. Emcee better dance with me!!!!
@united hahahaha. 7 years later? Sorry. that ship has sailed. I was a broke college kid. Now in make enough paper to fly any airline

@JetBlue Can you tell me if flight 1202 on Wednesday has been cancelled?
.@JetBlue gets all the props on Earth for boarding the plane from the back to the front.  I have never been more relaxed on a plane.
How come @southwestair is the only airline that is consistent and on-time?! They treat you like a human too. Never flying @americanair again
Poor rich boy RT @iamwill: I fly @BA @quantas &amp; they wait for premium passengers to arrive...they don't give away your seat like @united
@ChrissyCostanza @USAirways I've heard like 3 people say that before soo...I'm just going to assume they're awful. XD you need @JetBlue lol
Word to families with infants: @United no longer allows families with small children to board early. Meaning...
Had the most wonderful time flying with @VirginAmerica - __ Never flying with anyone else below you again 
@united just flew UA 48 to Mumbai and left my iPad Air2 in my seat 9K. Is there a lost and found?
Great to see you! @JoyceMSullivan - @JetBlue is my fave... kick back relax and watch a little TV on your way home! #TrueBlue

@lsteltenpohl @united 52 minutes later I am booked on an American Airlines flight after I was told there were no flights.
@united Kudos to the gate staff and flight crew for UA1655 MCO-IAD today.  The long delay and a very busy crowd were all under control.
At the airport waiting for a @JetBlue flight to land.  I'm a bit early.
Staying in Dallas 2 days longer for Thanksgiving break - it took two minutes to change the flight. @SouthwestAir. you're the best once more!
@joshwolfcomedy @united can u switch to a different airline for miles? Or are you stuck? I use southwest. but don't know if that wks 4 u?
@DeltaAssist Traveled VN 347/841 NGO-HAN-REP. HAN-REP miles already in Skymiles acct but no NGO-HAN miles.  Wait or submit claim?

Please @DeltaAssist don't let flight 1420 leave without me. We just landed! I promise I'll run fast and sing your praises.

@petrillic @united only thing worse is middle seat on United today.
@united My flight had issue and turned back to EWR.  Flight crew were very professional.  That's why I fly with you guys.
Only @JetBlue would value investors over customers. Comes down to the all mighty dollar. The classic. "we have more than those guys" excuse.
My first flight of 2015 and 1st time flying @SouthwestAir and NOT being A-List in 4 years or more! I miss it already! http://t.co/RltocamkXB

Appreciate the upgrade @VirginAmerica but a middle seat is never as good as an aisle #:(
Got through customs. Now a bit of a wait for my flight to Austin! (at @United Club - Terminal E in Houston. TX) https://t.co/9Gu3DD9G2H
Grew up eating @AlaskaAir meals. set the bar pretty high. Flying other airlines was a real let-down. Miss free meals in coach though.
@judoscott @PhilGizzi @AmericanAir Kid's school day was shorter than your wait time - buses are here
The @united safety video has a Wilhelm Scream in it
PensÃ© que @VivaAerobus era mala... hasta que me tocÃ³ viajar por @AmericanAir esta es terrible.
.@PHLAirport has to be the worst in the USA. I hope @AmericanAir and @USAirways drop it as a hub. #chaos #filthy
@JetBlue is flight 1970 from Fort Lauderdale to Boston cancelled?
yall have Gossip Girls season 6 on international flights? Need to know if I should start it or wait till my 15 hr flight to Dubai @united
When would the Nov schedule be available for @SouthwestAir ? Can't wait to set up the Thanksgiving 2015 trips settled!
Family stress. I desperately want to jump on one of those @AmericanAir Weekly Deals to Go. And then stay. Under an assumed name.
@JetBlue I'm hopeful! Totally my fault. Too much birthday partying last night. :(
@julie2768 @SouthwestAir help my friend. My issues were resolved through reaching out on social media #DoBetter #SafetyFirstCustomer2nd
@AmericanAir I know that I asked you this before. but when will the AA flight from MIA arrive at FRA. and when will it leave FRA? ;)

Big shout to the attendant on @VirginAmerica flight 193 to SFO â€” who just did the whole safety video dance for the delayed passengers.
@DeltaPoints @DeltaSegmentFly @Delta @AlaskaAir @AmericanAir sigh are you leaving?
@SouthwestAir "Because My Nanny Told Me So"!  A book dedicated to all the kids who have lost their mother! God Bless!
@AmericanAir I like American air lines no problems
@JetBlue Great work by your team at BOS this am under stressful conditions. Kept everyone informed. Still ended up with a great flight.
@united @bicyclingman   We were told by the gate agent that United would be offering vouchers for the inconvenience
@ryanckulp @VirginAmerica sorry to hear that; I just didn't like their DFW digs... relegated to a really crappy terminal. Hoping DAL is cool
When you check-in late and  @SouthwestAir still gets your luggage on the flight :') #goodguySW
@JohnCFSS @JetBlue we had a fantastic trip with them 3 weeks ago from Orlando it was the best flight I've ever had in-spite of the the delay
Despite my seatback TV not working. I have an awesome crew of Flight Attendants. plenty of snacks. and a smooth flight! Love @JetBlue 
@Ali_Sweeney @AmericanAir Nice....we miss you
"@alyssafrey: ...just got hung up on by... @USAirways... without even getting an option to wait for a CS rep.... @AmericanAir" noted.
@SouthwestAir I'm here. On the plane in Pittsburgh waiting on the announcement!
@McCourtyTwins @JetBlue Not cool. Get D-Mac to where he is going !
@AmericanAir Can't wait to read Adam Pitluk's latest column!
@JohnCFitness @AmericanAir @Boeing But would they switch to 787 for that route? Big enough plane?
Gotta give @JetBlue credit. Inbound flight left 70 minutes late. my outbound flight will only arrive at destination 15 min late. #witchcraft
I've traveled to the same destination 1/2 w/ @SouthwestAir and 1/2 @Delta. Southwest = zero issues. Delta = major issues 1/2 the time.
@Brooklyn_Chase @SouthwestAir agreed. Terrible airport
Another step into the obscurity of the competition; best thing about @JetBlue used to be differentiation. I project $400m of lost revenue...
Can't remember the last time I flew @SouthwestAir outta @flyLAXairport without a delay. Held up every. Single. Time. 😩
@JetBlue any word on flight 27 leaving EWR at 9am? We don't want to be stuck at the airport with 2 babies. Thanks!!
Guy next to me on @AmericanAir upset at flight attendant because he wants pasta and only steak is left. #preorder
@The_ChrisMyers @united Wait. Weren't they waiting for a text from Chicago in Houston? LA is nowhere near Chicago ðŸ˜•
@VirginAmerica I think it's safe to say I will never be flying American again. very impressed.
@SouthwestAir I was disappointed to find that the peanuts and Ritz crackers had wheat in the ingredients. Whats a celiac to do? #GF
@Jennife14402688 @JensenAckles @AmericanAir Where's Cas when you need him?! Oh. wait. He doesn't have wings anymore. Too soon?
Wait @VirginAmerica. why isn't @hgtv part of the channel lineup. I was really hoping to watch #FixerUpper. Bummer.
@AmericanAir just boarded 43. Looks like 15min delay. Cancelled my original flight then moved me out of the exit row at boarding. #NoWorries
@STLouisRams @united @TBBuccaneers cant wait to see the #rams play tomorrow!!
Best thing about flying @VirginAmerica - watching #SFGiants on @CSNBayArea and switching to Giants TV #flybyebaby http://t.co/Gai5EbipNS
Another amazing #customerservice experience with @AlaskaAir today--acknowledging an issue without me even reaching out!
Super weird. @SeleneLuna. I've NEVER encountered any issues pre-boarding on ANY airline when I needed to. #shame @VirginAmerica @margaretcho
This plane smells like bacon sandwiches !!! @AmericanAir 😬
What a great welcome back. Laughable. Deplaning #UA758. I shoulda stuck with @VirginAmerica. Thanks. @United.

@jetblue - How I wish you didn't partner with @emirates. but rather flew there yourself. Miss your love &amp; service - True #JetBlue fan!
A 3hr delay at IAH isn't so bad with a shower. Philosophy shampoo and warm towels in @united Club south.
@sandiegoairport the craft brews bar &amp; restaurant in @SouthwestAir gates 1&amp;2 area is not nearly large enough to accommodate 2 flights.  Fail
@RebelTNA @united And I thought Delta was bad

@AlaskaAir It was the 20% promo which was included in the gift bags handed out upon arrival in late December
Hey @SouthwestAir if you're going to delay the flight 2+ hours. maybe don't delete my e-boarding pass from the app. just a thought
Huge thank you to Toylin (BOS) and Llana (BWI) for helping me track down a couple lost items in the today.  Thank you @JetBlue!
@JetBlue What? Another special scheme? If yes I can't wait.
.@VirginAmerica please bring my boy @andiilawson home safe on flight VS8. Can't wait to see him tomorrow! Free upgrade surprise? #cheeky
@united Hi. I have a problem to inform by MD.
@SouthwestAir I can leave college and go home for Turkey Day now. any chance you give me a promo code??
@AmericanAir yea already did that. They were more concerned about people with short layovers bc of the delayed flight.
@united Beijing flight had wifi but #apple only no #andriod support stuck #howtotrainyourdragon #thanksfornap
@DeltaAssist Had to cancel a flight last minute due to medical emergency (purchased w/sky miles). Best way to rebook? 800#?
@united I submitted a refund request and accidentally entered the wrong ticket number â€” how can i cancel that?
Will only be 8 hours late to SFO this time. things are looking up @United
@united is it still possible to be upgraded via RPU if there are "RN0 and R0" class seats on a flight? What if one of those people cancel?
You are no longer my boy. Blue. http://t.co/aIxSoeIKj8 @JetBlue
@AmericanAir where can we issue a complaint regarding ground crew conduct?
@DeltaAssist Please give a bonus to the workers at gate C5 tonight. They've had to deal with some shit.
@JetBlue #TrickorTweet smell my feet. give me something good to eat ;P
_@dandickau21: Huge thank you to @AlaskaAir for helping switch a flight. there's a reason I always try to fly with Alaska._They're the best!
@united is it possible to contact baggage office in CHS directly? Four calls to call center have made matters worse.
@poppaboo yes @AlaskaAir is amazing. very sad they'll be gone in a few years. Delta and southwest are good as well
In my seat on my @JetBlue flight. Even more room. even more speed? Heck yes please! #TrueBlue #Fanboy #JFK to #BUF #WheelsUp ✈️😎👍

It's a sad state of air travel that this is necessary in the @United lounge http://t.co/VAO3uP5cVK
@SouthwestAir that would be much appreciated!Lots of ppl have complained about it. Sad when 2-200lb men &amp; myself can't fit in a row properly
Grateful for my @SennheiserUSA headphones to help cancel out the sound of my neighbors criticizing the hardworking @AlaskaAir flight crew
@AmericanAir Never flown before so silly question but how do I get my boarding pass? From the self serve kiosk??

@SouthwestAir headed to DCA tomorrow night from PUJ. layover in ATL. What's the SOP if the 9:15pm DCA flight gets delayed due to weather?
Scheduled to fly into SF during what CNN calls a "river in the sky." Schools are cancelled but @united says flights are on-schedule.

@DeltaAssist I am concerned of missing my connection how do I check change fights and keep my 1st class seats?
@Guglieri2313 @colorlessraider @united   Oh I see.  Sorry a little slow on the uptake.
#biofuels are soaring! In 2016. @southwestair will purchase fuel sourced frm waste wood for their SanFran airports http://t.co/xTzUODV48o
Since I've been on hold with Frontier. I've checked my @united rewards. @SouthwestAir rewards. did a load of laundry. solved world hunger...
.@AmericanAir I left an item on my flight. How do I contact you folks at @flyLAXairport? Your lost &amp; found is closed for the weekend?
@jetblue stranding a group of college students in NC? WTF? It's BS that you are telling them no flights to JFK in the next two days.
@JetBlue #TrickOrTweet smell my feet. give me something good to eat on the next flight out of there.
@JasonWhitely @wfaachannel8 @VirginAmerica @DallasLoveField It will take longer to load you all them to fly
@DeltaAssist In Israel and need to speak with Delta agent re baggage issue. Is there a phone number I can call or can I be called?

@caseyshoots @virginamerica Thanks Casey! Tell the guy next to you to suck it up (and make sure you show him The Sadist scene!)
@united Don't fail me today. It's a long day for both of us.
I see a lot of hate tweets on American Airlines but @SouthwestAir is cheating us out of $100 so maybe American isnt so bad. #swsucks #plzRT
@AmericanAir just won't give up! $117 round trip DFW-LAS. Leave as early as tonight. @dfwairport belongs to AA. Spirit! Better watch out!
Getting stuck in the middle seat is the worst.... Unless you get stuck between two super cute guys! Thanks @VirginAmerica !!!
@DoryuuShepherd @SouthwestAir :ccccc Sorry man! That's awful! If you need anything. bro just holler.

Congrats to @MsHelenWu on her new gig at @JetBlue! We're so happy for her. but @MRY will miss her dearly.
@adventurousness @AmericanAir you can always file a complaint with the DOT. but it probably won't go anywhere
@DeltaAssist 1 day this thread will show up as an example of what not to do on social. Loyal customer has problem. Don't point them to 1-800

The Columbus Dispatch is reporting that a fire from a heating cart damaged a parked @SouthwestAir plane early this morning. No injuries.
@datachick lemme guess @united closed the door early? Where are you stuck?
@DeltaAssist Poor uniform standards by this gate agent. As a fellow DL employee. a blue turtleneck &amp; no name tag looks sloppy. #Dconcourse
Hi @united I volunteered off a flight this morning DTW-EWR. Agent put me on AA. but not enough time to issue $400 travel voucher.
@VirginAmerica I would like to thank the Air Marshal for switching seats with my son.  It was a pleasure to fly with you guys.
@DeltaAssist I never received my "gold" credentials.

@JetBlue getting anxious looking at PM weather in BOS. Is there a good chance flight 772 will be delayed or cancelled tonight?
Thanks for getting us to Boston safely. @jetblue turbulence sucked. but the pilot was great.

Cant wait to buy my @JetBlue tickets for our much needed vacation :) #SupportJetBlue
@JetBlue Finally home after a crappy flight. Who do you write to give praise for great crew / and ding people that were less than helpful?
@AmericanAir is terrible. As a former Priority Gold customer I used to love flying your airline. @JetBlue &amp; @VirginAmerica would have never
